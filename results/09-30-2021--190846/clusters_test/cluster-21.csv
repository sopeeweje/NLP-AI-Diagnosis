"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In determine an exploratory ML analysis, we will the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are strongly linked t o functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10136105,R01MH120091,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,317000
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,10076848,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,395000
"Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are guideline- recommended therapies for preventing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in patients with CKD. However, in real-world practice, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued by providers in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), rapid declines in kidney function, or advanced CKD. Premature discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs can lead to adverse clinical outcomes among patients with CKD. However, discontinuation of these agents may be appropriate for certain CKD subgroups who are at higher risk of AKI and who may derive less benefit from these agents than trial populations. Although guidelines support the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with CKD, they also allow for individualization of decisions surrounding their use. However, it is unclear how to best individualize these decisions as CKD progresses to optimize kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to personalize ACEI/ARB therapy for patients with CKD based on each individual's risk factors for ESKD and CVD. To accomplish this, we will use data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. We will first identify factors that drive the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs (Aim 1). Next, we will build two clinical tools that model the relationship between ACEI/ARB discontinuation and risk of ESKD (Aim 2) or CVD events (Aim 3) in individuals with CKD. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of kidney disease and improve patient outcomes by individualizing medication use in CKD. We expect that completion of these aims will result in the development of two prediction tools that can be further refined and implemented in real-world clinical practice as part of a career development award application. The proposed aims are integrated into a comprehensive training plan that includes a Master's Degree in Clinical Research and practical mentored experiences. Through this training plan, Dr. Chen will have the opportunity to 1) learn and apply knowledge in advanced biostatistical and epidemiological methods, including marginal structural modeling; 2) gain familiarity with the CRIC Study database, 3) apply machine learning algorithms to the development of clinical prediction tools, 4) refine skills in scientific writing and presenting research, and 5) advance towards a career development award and independence as a clinical investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to prevent adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on a population level. However, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued despite guidelines recommending their use as first-line anti-hypertensive agents in CKD. This proposal aims to develop clinical tools that will predict whether individuals are likely to benefit versus be harmed by discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs, with the goal of improving the safe and appropriate use of these agents in CKD.",Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease,10313873,F32DK130543,"['Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Solid', 'Stroke', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hyperkalemia', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized care', 'personalized decision', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2021,88630
"Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. Palliative care has the potential to improve ADRD care, improve patient-clinician communication and patient-centered outcomes, while decreasing unwanted burdensome treatments and improving care at the end of life. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. The default response to critical illness for patients with ADRD (and all others) is intubation, mechanical ventilation, and aggressive care despite having no change in mortality outcome. ADRD patients and their caregivers may prefer to avoid these interventions.  To address these gaps, we have developed a COVID-19 ACP Educator-led, video-assisted palliative care intervention to improve patient-clinician communication, increase ACP documentation, and lead to more patient-centered care at the end of life. We will identify all hospitalized patients aged 65 and older, and any patient with ADRD, and then an ACP Educator will proactively proceed with primary palliative care services of ACP, leveraging certified video decision aids that we have developed. The ACP Educator to be tested in this proposal represents a new role and proactive function for the palliative care team. The ACP Educator, who will be a palliative care nurse, will work with older patients or patients with ADRD and proxy decision-makers to learn about and document patients' wishes.  The overall objective is to reduce the burden of COVID-19 by expanding the reach of inpatient palliative care, especially for patients with ADRD. We propose to conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of an ACP Educator intervention among hospitalized patients aged 65 and over, or any patient with ADRD and their proxy decision-makers in the ward and ICU settings of two major hospitals: Boston Medical Center and North Shore University Hospital. Patient outcomes will be abstracted from electronic health records with Natural Language Processing. We will evaluate intervention effectiveness by comparing the following outcomes among 9,000 hospitalized patients: ACP documentation; preferences for resuscitation; palliative care consults; and, hospice use. We will characterize caregiver-centered outcomes of patients with ADRD, including: (1) knowledge, (2) confidence in future care, (3) communication satisfaction, and (4) decisional certainty in 600 caregivers of patients with ADRD admitted to the hospital. COVID-19 poses a unique dilemma for older Americans and patients with ADRD and their caregivers, who must balance their desire to live against the risk of a lonely and potentially traumatic hospital death. Video decision support is a practical, evidence- based, and innovative approach to assist patients facing such choices. If proven effective, this innovative care model can be immediately deployed across the country to improve the quality of care for millions of Americans. The majority of patients aged 65 or over, and patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), have never communicated their preferences to clinicians or completed advance care planning (ACP) documents. The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has acutely escalated the importance of integrating ACP and palliative care services into medical care. We aim to improve ACP with an ACP Educator who will promote ACP conversations with certified video decision aids in a model of care that is practical, scalable, and evidence-based, has the potential to mitigate communication barriers related to health literacy and limited English proficiency, and has the potential to improve the quality of medical care delivered to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Meeting the Challenges of COVID-19 by Expanding the Reach of Palliative Care: Proactive Advance Care Planning with Videos for the Elderly and all Patients with Dementia,10251623,R01AG072911,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Boston', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communication', 'Communication Barriers', 'Complex', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limited English Proficiency', 'Loneliness', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Palliative Care Nursing', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'University Hospitals', 'Work', 'aged', 'care systems', 'compare effectiveness', 'dementia care', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health literacy', 'hospice environment', 'human old age (65+)', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'older patient', 'palliative', 'pandemic disease', 'patient-clinician communication', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'visual information', 'ward']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2487017
"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,10188647,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'provider factors', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694144
"Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes Project Summary Excess weight is associated with 13 types of cancer. These cancers disproportionately affect Black and Latinx individuals, as well as those with lower socioeconomic status, because overweight and obesity incidence is higher in these groups. Behavioral weight loss interventions are effective, but in-person interventions tend to have low reach. As mobile phone ownership is increasing in the United States, mHealth technology holds promise for reaching a larger population than in-person behavioral interventions. Furthermore, because they travel with individuals and can collect digital information in real-time, mHealth tools make it possible to intervene with individuals at the precise point when the interventions are needed with just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). As currently implemented, mHealth JITAIs are adaptive in the sense that interventionists can specify decision rules a priori that result in intervention messages that are triggered or tailored by certain events. These experimenter-specified decision rules are generally based upon results of prior studies, specifically micro-randomized trials that provide sequential tests of mHealth intervention messages in order to determine causal effects of messages conditional on user context. However, JITAIs that are developed in this manner cannot be truly individually tailored because the same decision rules are equally applied to everybody without regard to information about how individuals actually respond to intervention messages. Rapidly evolving machine learning methods, specifically reinforcement learning (RL), makes it possible to improve upon the current approach to JITAIs by learning each person's unique response patterns and integrating this information into subsequent, person-specific, adaptive decision rules. However, the few behavioral interventionists who have created mHealth JITAIs for weight loss using RL have noted high practical barriers to doing so because implementation of RL requires specialized expertise and can be labor intensive. The field needs a user-friendly tool to reduce these barriers in order for RL methodology to become widely adopted. Aim 1 is to develop Adapt, a tool that iteratively integrates real-time data, applies RL algorithms, and performs micro-randomized trials to optimize JITAI decision rules for weight loss. Adapt will pull in digital health data in real-time and conduct micro-randomized trials using behavioral patterns and outcomes to arrive at the most efficacious intervention message, delivered at the right time, for promoting weight loss in each participant. Aim 2 is to conduct a 12-week pilot feasibility study testing usability of Adapt in a weight loss intervention (NudgeRL). NudgeRL will build upon the team's existing JITAI, Nudge, which did not incorporate RL. The sample will consist of 20 adults with overweight or obesity, at least 50% of whom are Black or Latinx. Although Adapt will be developed to improve weight loss interventions, its widespread use will result in more efficient and efficacious JITAIs across a broad range of health outcomes, resulting in a lower burden of cancer and other disease due to a wide spectrum of improved health behaviors. Project Narrative The objective of this project is to develop a tool that will make it easier for behavioral interventionists to implement reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, into adaptive mobile (mHealth) interventions, specifically those intended to promote weight control. Widespread use of this tool will result in more efficient and effective adaptive mHealth interventions, ultimately leading to a lower burden of obesity-linked disease, including cancer.",Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes,10195835,R21CA260092,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positive Reinforcements', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'digital', 'digital health', 'effective intervention', 'efficacious intervention', 'fitbit', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'obesity risk', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web-based tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,410893
"The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics), Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in dissemination and implementation science. This will provide him with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on developing, implementing, and disseminating novel management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero but persisting after birth (PNH) affects tens of thousands of infants each year in the United States, but its management is complicated by ambiguous reporting of hydronephrosis severity and a relatively limited understanding of predictors of disease outcome and knowledge of the disease’s natural history. The proposed research uses the largest known pediatric hydronephrosis cohort to develop a tool to translates free-text ultrasound reports into coded PNH grades, predict the 2-year outcome using 3-month baseline data, and apply sophisticated modeling techniques to simulate the disease’s natural history. Taken together, results from this proposal will lead to the development of a standardized management strategy for PNH and facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel treatment and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, beginning with pediatric hydronephrosis.",The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH),10086087,K08DK119535,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Radiology', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Selection Bias', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologic Surgeon', 'Urology', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'in utero diagnosis', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatrician', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prognostic', 'research and development', 'skills', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2021,166997
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,10214688,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,738379
"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,10131234,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000
"A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Allen Lee, MD is a gastroenterologist with advanced training in gastrointestinal motility whose research focuses on identifying abnormalities in host-microbial interactions to improve care in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals are to identify novel subgroups of IBS patients which inform biological responses to therapies and guide management. The proposed K23 mentored career development award includes a 3-year plan for training, didactics, and research activities that will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator. Career Development: Dr. Lee will develop skills in the following four areas: 1) culture-independent approaches to study host-microbial interactions in IBS; 2) advanced biostatistical methods to study longitudinal datasets, including mixed models or generalized additive models; 3) laboratory-based translational techniques; 4) predictive analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. These training goals will directly contribute to Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals and prepare him to submit a successful R01 application. Research Context: Common treatments in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) are effective in ≤50% patients. Additionally, there are currently no methods to identify patients more likely to respond to different treatments. The current paradigm for managing IBS patients revolves around identifying and treating the predominant symptom complexes. However, this is a hugely inefficient model and leads to frustration for both patients and health care providers. This proposal seeks to determine whether a systems biology approach, which incorporates microbiome and metabolomics data along with detailed clinical phenotype information, may identify novel subgroups that inform treatment decisions in IBS-D. Research Plan: This career development award leverages an on-going clinical trial comparing the effects of a nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS-D patients to identify differences in microbial community structure and function in responders vs. non-responders to therapy. Specific Aim 1 will identify fecal microbial features by 16S rRNA sequence analysis characteristic of treatment response to rifaximin or a low FODMAP diet. Specific Aim 2 will determine how treatments with rifaximin or low FODMAP diet affect the fecal metabolome, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids, in IBS-D patients. Specific Aim 3 will develop predictive models to identify subsets of IBS-D patients responsive to treatment. We will also identify risk factors for non-response to either rifaximin or low FODMAP diet. Results from this proposal will inform two future R01 proposals to validate these findings as well as to understand the mechanisms by which host-microbial interactions may mediate response to different therapies in IBS. Project Narrative Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common but difficult condition to manage likely because it is a heterogeneous disorder. This research proposal seeks to determine whether patients with IBS- D can be better stratified by their fecal microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites. Results from this proposal may lead to a paradigm change in the way that we manage and treat IBS and potentially lead to an era of precision medicine in IBS.",A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,10125589,K23DK124567,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bile Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Butyrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Data', 'Diarrhea', 'Diet', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monosaccharides', 'Multiomic Data', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence Factors', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'common treatment', 'dietary', 'experience', 'fecal metabolome', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'polyol', 'potential biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'rifaximin', 'skills', 'stem', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,194608
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",10149406,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Poverty', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2021,367436
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,10224085,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,485426
"Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms that are marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this CHR population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. Thus, to improve predictive models that are clinically relevant, several issues need to be addressed: 1) focusing on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) taking into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) integrating data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms to overcome variability across studies. To address these challenges, the proposed “Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center” (PREDICT-DPACC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced researchers with proven capabilities in all aspects of large-scale studies, CHR studies, as well as computational expertise. The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials. To do so, the PREDICT-DPACC will 1) aggregate extant CHR- related data sets from legacy datasets; 2) provide collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for new U01 multisite network(s); and 3) develop and apply advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, and to stratify CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories, first from the extant data and then refined and applied to the new data. The PREDICT-DPACC team has the broad, comprehensive, and robust infrastructure that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of multiple data types and to optimally address the needs of the CHR U01 network(s). Carefully selected extant data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Proposed analysis methods are powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. The U01 network(s) will be coordinated by a team that is experienced in managing large studies, familiar with the needs of such studies, flexible, and is knowledgeable in all aspects of CHR studies, including measures, outcomes, biomarkers, and cohorts. Upon meeting the goals of this U24, and the supported U01 network(s), the expected outcomes of the PREDICT-DPACC will be new predictive biomarkers for CHR outcomes, new definitions of CHR subtypes that are clinically useful, and new curated and comprehensive CHR datasets (extant and new) as well as processing tools and prediction algorithms that are shared with the research community through the NIMH Data Archive. NARRATIVE The “Clinical High Risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome in young people represents an opportune window for early intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis and other disorders, and to forestall disability; however, clinical heterogeneity and the paucity of biomarkers have hampered the development of effective intervention. To address these challenges, working with NIMH and key stakeholders, we will harmonize and aggregate existing “legacy” CHR data, and guide and coordinate the collection of new data across a network of sites, to develop biomarker algorithms that can predict individual trajectories for diverse outcomes. This proposal leverages a multidisciplinary team with broad and CHR-specific experience in large-scale multisite and multimodal studies (including clinical trials), along with expertise in data type-specific processing, coordination, analysis, and computational analyses (e.g., machine and deep learning tools from artificial intelligence, and advanced statistical approaches), ethics, community outreach, and data dissemination, all of which will ensure the success of this project.","Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center",10256796,U24MH124629,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'bioinformatics infrastructure', 'candidate marker', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical risk', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data archive', 'data dictionary', 'data dissemination', 'data harmonization', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'outcome prediction', 'persistent symptom', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'resilience', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U24,2021,3917810
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10223453,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2021,188548
"Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence Youth violence victimization is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is the strongest predictor of poor quality of life following trauma, even among those injured during the event. Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-victimization risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of youth at risk for poor long-term adjustment following victimization or other types of trauma, and there are no studies measuring relevant neural systems. Thus, our team aims to 1) characterize acute post-victimization neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat processing and frontoparietal networks for cognitive control, and 2) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of youth neuroimaging, behavior and self-report, parent and family factors, and neighborhood and community variables. Our team is well-prepared to successfully achieve these aims, as we have relevant expertise in conducting prospective longitudinal assessment of acute neurobehavioral predictors of risk for PTSD in adults (Larson), conducting longitudinal assessment of youth victims of violence (Levas), and longitudinally characterizing neurobehavioral profiles of youth PTSD (Herringa). We will recruit youth victims of violence aged 10-16 from the Emergency Department at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months following victimization. To achieve a final sample of 200 youth at 12 month follow-up, we will recruit 240 youth, oversampled for risk for PTSD based on currently available brief self-report indicators. Each assessment will include measures of neural systems instantiating threat processing, including both reactivity to threat and anticipation of unpredictable and predictable threat, and cognitive control, along with measures of PTSD and other symptoms, cognitive functioning, family environment, social and school functioning, and socioenvironmental factors (e.g. neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination). We will examine how acute post- victimization variables (2 week) and early change following victimization (from 2 weeks to 3 months) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later. We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified regions and predictors, as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses. The comprehensive assessment will allow for determination of the additional utility of neural markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of risk for PTSD following victimization that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant cognitive control) that can directly inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for youth victims of violence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying youth victims of violence most at risk for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem. This work seeks to identify dysregulation in neural circuitry supporting cognitive and affective processes two weeks after victimization predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later. These data will advance our understanding of neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of violence victimization.",Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence,10237892,R01MH124076,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early-life trauma', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'brain health', 'child and adolescent victimization', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'physical assault', 'post-trauma', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'risk prediction', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic stress', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization', 'youth violence']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2021,714526
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",10152666,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,788885
"Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract  In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment. However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight- loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia, body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss. Project Narrative Although over 40,000 obese individuals with end-stage kidney disease initiate dialysis each year in the United States, there are no guidelines on optimal obesity management in the setting of dialysis care. Obese dialysis patients may lose weight due to chronic illness or due to intentional weight loss attempts, though it is difficult to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss in these patients. This proposal seeks to advance the science of obesity management in dialysis settings by providing new tools to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss trajectories among obese dialysis patients.",Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease,10179372,R01DK124388,"['Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietitian', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Kilogram', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Nephrology', 'Non obese', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Transplant Recipients', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'experience', 'hazard', 'health related quality of life', 'healthy weight', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obese patients', 'obese person', 'obesity management', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'sleep quality', 'stakeholder perspectives', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,291877
"A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients Summary – Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow a presentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear and whether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fierce debates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in the past for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. In this study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and create salient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2), and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models for KD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate the performance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study we will include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless of whether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for but eventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted data will be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping and biomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used to establish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61 period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In the following 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real- time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for future deployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD and pediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites. More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasible and perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data science methods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-C patients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and will more rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C. Project narrative - The primary objective of this study is to design and validate a predictive decision support system for the identification, treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). To develop this system, we will adapt and retrain machine learning algorithms which we have previously trained in patients with Kawasaki Disease, a pediatric inflammatory vasculopathy with multiple similarities to MIS-C. This study, performed in collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) consortium, will consist of two phases, first a large-scale data collection and algorithm development effort and second, the prospective evaluation of the performance and clinical utility of the algorithm ahead of large-scale deployment.",A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients,10272448,R61HD105591,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Decision Support Systems', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'disease registry', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pediatric patients', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R61,2021,917957
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,10137995,K01HL136687,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'participant enrollment', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'respiratory health', 'risk prediction model', 'statistical learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,172704
"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,10131844,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,174917
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief. These findings may advance understanding of the process of grief, facilitate early identification of high-risk grievers and potentially form the basis for targeted treatment of complicated grief.",Predicting complicated grief from grief processing,10124433,K23MH114021,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Down-Regulation', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Guilt', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Reaction Time', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Stimulus', 'Suicide', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Trauma', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intense pain', 'loved ones', 'neural patterning', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2021,199800
"Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Management in CKD ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting >33.5 million adults world- wide. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also highly prevalent and affects 14% of the U.S. and North American population. The burden of AF is 3-fold higher in CKD and affects up to 25% of CKD patients. AF is strongly associated with risk of ischemic stroke and death; and these risks are even higher in patients with CKD. Even in the absence of clinical ischemic stroke, some studies have suggested that AF is also associated with excess risks of all dementia types, including Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, although definitive evidence is lacking. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by neurodegenerative changes in the brain, including amyloid depositions and neurofibrillary tangles. It is plausible that AF may lead to cerebral microinfarcts, cerebral hemorrhage and reduced cerebral blood flow, all which could promote Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Gaining a greater understanding of the association of AF with Alzheimer’s and other dementias is particularly important in the CKD population, in whom the incidence and prevalence of dementia is even higher compared with the general population; and in whom the cause of dementia remains elusive and thus largely untreated. Currently, data on the risk of dementia in patients with CKD and AF are limited and may provide new insight into the mechanisms that contribute to dementia in CKD patients. Further, data on whether treatment of AF mitigates risk of dementia are conflicting in all populations (regardless of CKD status). While there are some existing studies of treatment of AF and risk of dementia, most have limitations, including (1) a primary focus on anticoagulation and not a comprehensive evaluation of other AF therapies; (2) inclusion of selected populations and none with CKD; and (3) inadequate consideration of interim clinical measures that may affect receipt and outcomes of AF therapies. Therefore, the effects of successful treatment of AF on risk of dementia remains largely unknown. Further data could identify novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of dementia. We propose to efficiently leverage our unique research platform that includes “real-world” contemporary data to evaluate the risk of dementia in patients with AF, with and without CKD; as well as determine whether successful treatment of AF with a comprehensive range of therapies is linked to a lower risk of dementia. To conduct this work, we will perform a rigorous comparative effectiveness analysis of >500,000 patients with and without AF from two participating health care systems in California. This proposed supplemental project will yield key insights to understanding the link between AF and dementia; particularly in the high-risk population of those with CKD. Furthermore, the anticipated results could form the basis of future randomized clinical trials. NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation is very common, particularly in patients with kidney disease. Studies have suggested that atrial fibrillation may be linked to dementia. In this study, we will evaluate the risk of dementia in patients with concurrent atrial fibrillation and kidney disease; and determine whether successful treatment of atrial fibrillation is linked with lower risk of dementia in this population.",Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Management in CKD,10287433,R01HL142834,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Incidence', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Procedures', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sinus', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'cerebral microinfarct', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness analysis', 'dementia risk', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'insight', 'mortality risk', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'population based', 'response', 'success', 'therapy adverse effect', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,409448
"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10251154,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2021,190266
"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis. Building a model of relapse risk prediction based on the presence of these cells will enable rapid, accurate, and actionable relapse prediction moving closer to the goal of preventing relapse.",Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10210902,R01CA251858,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biology', 'CREB1 gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SYK gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,615576
"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality. Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people. We propose to provide forecasters and public health officials across the country with location-specific, health-based evidence as to the effectiveness of heat alerts and insights into how to improve them to better protect the public’s health.",Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality.,10051418,R01ES029950,"['Age', 'Air Conditioning', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Government Officials', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Hospitalization', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'United States', 'Weather', 'age group', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'burden of illness', 'comparative', 'evidence base', 'extreme heat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'sex', 'statistical learning']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,627397
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,10135813,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,298890
"Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for measuring the effect of a treatment or intervention. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test all research questions, whether due to cost, achieving sufficient subject sizes or when administering an arm of the trial would be unethical. To understand the effects of therapeutics, policy changes, and other interventions where it is not possible to administer a clinical trial, researchers have developed approaches that attempt to simulate clinical trials in observational data. Despite sophisticated statistical methodologies, it is not clear whether it is possible to reliably simulate a randomized controlled in observational data. We aim to quantify one potential driver of these different results, differences between the clinical trial and real-world populations. In Aim 1, we compare trials that have individual level data available to three real- world data sources. In Aim 2, we develop methodologies to infer most likely individual-level statistics from aggregate trial statistics using real world data. Finally, in Aim 3 we compare neurological trials that do not release individual level data to real world data. We then estimate the transportability of treatment estimates across different populations including: the population eligible for the trial in RWD and the population ineligible for the trial but receiving the treatment in RWD. This allows for the study of indication drift and treatment heterogeneity. By uncovering differences between these groups, we may be able to identify groups that are underrepresented in clinical trials to help reduce healthcare disparities. The K99/R00 award will allow me to gain expertise in using regulatory sciences (with mentor Dr. Florence Bourgeois and advisor Dr. Deborah Schrag) for biologic discovery (with mentors Dr. Tianxi Cai and Dr. Isaac Kohane) within neurology (with mentors Dr. Page Pennell and Dr. Clemens Scherzer). My background in statistics, informatics, genetics, and machine learning with clinical data sources ideally positions me for the proposed project. The proposed training plan, mentoring and project will provide a strong foundation for a successful transition to independent research. Clinical trial populations are a subset of the overall population and may be biased through several factors. To better understand disease, reduce healthcare disparities for underrepresented groups, assess drug approvals, and ensure safety as the indications for a drug expand it is critical to quantify how representative clinical trials are of the real-world population. Identifying enriched and underrepresented groups offers the opportunity to identify subpopulations who may have heterogeneous treatment effects and/or underlying physiologies.",Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations,10127341,K99NS114850,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Estrogens', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Menarche', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perimenopause', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Placebos', 'Policies', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'arm', 'base', 'birth control', 'cost', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness analysis', 'efficacy clinical trial', 'glucosylceramidase', 'health care disparity', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'oncology trial', 'patient population', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'unethical']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,118759
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10264169,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,590213
"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology. Characterization of such clusters will enable public health departments and policy makers in targeted surveillance of their regions and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources. Project Narrative  This project will develop a new methodology to quantify the potential risks of under-vaccinated spatial clusters for highly infectious diseases. It will rank the clusters based on their economic and epidemic burden which will enable public health ofﬁcials in targeted surveillance and interventions, to mitigate their risk.",Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots,10197938,R01GM109718,"['Affect', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral Model', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Clusterings', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Herd Immunity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'New Jersey', 'New York', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'economic cost', 'economic outcome', 'health care delivery', 'health disparity', 'health organization', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'provider networks', 'public health intervention', 'social', 'social media', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vaccine hesitancy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,321062
"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. We will leverage expansive electronic health record data from two of the largest healthcare organizations in California to create and validate a new LTBI screening and treatment approach that can vastly improve identification and successful treatment of LTBI.",A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment,10129277,R01AI151072,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'effectiveness measure', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'simulation', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment guidelines', 'wasting']",NIAID,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,798304
"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of ³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) – an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patient’s age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients’ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from ≥140/90). This could worsen the already low rate of compliance (25-65%) to treatment guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate physician compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guideline and its association with patient BP using electronic health record data that comprises information on several aspects of hypertension care. Findings of this study will help in designing future targeted interventions to enhance compliance to treatment guideline and BP control.",Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure,10111556,K01HL145345,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Side Effects', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prospective', 'provider adherence', 'skills', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2021,121124
"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,10312690,R44AG060857,"['Affect', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Clocks', 'Building Codes', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Feeds', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Phototherapy', 'Planet Earth', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Wakefulness', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active control', 'alertness', 'appropriate dose', 'awake', 'base', 'biological systems', 'circadian', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'design', 'dosage', 'effectiveness testing', 'experience', 'falls', 'field study', 'health data', 'improved', 'interest', 'meter', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prototype', 'residence', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2021,28487
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients.

"Predicting Short- and Long-term Future Occurrence of Atrial Fibrillation from Single-Lead ECG in Normal Sinus Rhythm with an Explainable Deep Learning Model. Project Summary/Abstract More than 30 million individuals worldwide are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF), however, another 13% of individuals with AF are left undiagnosed. People with AF have a five-fold increased risk of stroke with up to one-third of all strokes shown to be related to AF. Timely administration of appropriate preventative therapies, especially anticoagulants, can significantly decrease the complications of AF, including strokes, by 65% and mortality by 30%. Digital health technologies offer new approaches to identify individuals with undiagnosed AF, in particular paroxysmal AF (PAF), characterized by occasional episodes of limited duration, for whom a 10-second 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) performed in the clinical setting is unlikely to overlap with an AF event. Continuous monitoring is promising, but still costly and burdensome for elderly individuals, who are at higher risk. To maximize the diagnostic yield of these technologies, we propose novel methods to predict the future occurrence of AF from a single-lead ECG during normal sinus rhythm. Only recently it was shown that it is possible to predict the future occurrence of AF from 12-lead ECGs in normal sinus rhythm collected in a clinical setting. Here, we propose to predict the occurrence of AF with commercially available single- lead ECG devices, which will enable a scalable alternative for early detection in a non-clinical setting. To achieve this goal, we will analyze retrospectively the raw single-lead ECG data of 10,000+ individuals with PAF over 14 days of monitoring. Validation work will then be carried out in a unique set of 1,718 asymptomatic individuals who participated in the prospective mSToPS clinical trial of AF screening (mean age 73), with full clinical information and co-morbidities. The three aims of this project are:  1. Compute the probability of a future AF event in the short-term for an individual in normal sinus rhythm using classic single-lead ECG features and representation learning based features.  2. Develop a method for long-term prediction of AF onset by evaluating individuals with AF detected in 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from the initial monitored period of normal sinus rhythm and by validating the algorithms using the mSToPS dataset with 3 years of clinical follow-up and annotated co-morbidities.  3. Develop a technique to provide a preliminary interpretation of representation learning features for time-series data applied to the short- and long-term prediction. This retrospective study will develop and optimize new predictive techniques from single-lead ECGs, available through consumer devices, with the goal of identifying individuals at high risk of developing AF. A future direction to build on from this study's results would include a prospective study of AF prediction using consumer single-lead ECG to improve clinical outcomes.

"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,10231005,R01HL152083,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bilateral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Electrons', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Ventilator', 'alveolar epithelium', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial injury', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'lung injury', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor for advanced glycation endproducts', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'secondary outcome', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,539888
"Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression PROJECT SUMMARY We have identified a novel property of the cervical spinal cord that modulates respiratory activity, both the rate and depth of breathing, such that the respiratory drive in opioid-suppressed states in mice and humans increases during spinal cord epidural stimulation. Respiratory rates are increased upon epidural stimulation of specific cervical spinal cord locations when there is spontaneous breathing, and rhythmic breathing can be generated when the respiratory state is depressed and spontaneous breathing is absent. This is an important observation because the brainstem, which contains the rhythm-generating center for respiration, is a difficult area for surgical and therapeutic access. If there are other accessible neural regions by surgery (i.e. epidural stimulation) or non-invasive means (i.e. transcutaneous stimulation), for example in the cervical spine, that influence respiration or contain their own rhythmic respiratory elements, these may represent potential therapeutic targets to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. Thus, we have proposed a strategy to characterize this novel cervical respiratory circuit. First, we will conduct extensive electrical mapping of the respiratory responsive elements of the cervical spinal cord in mice aided by machine learning strategies, and we will characterize the mechanistic basis for this response, the relation to opioid receptors to the respiratory response, and identity neurons responsible for the respiratory response using optogenetic techniques. Guided by the animal studies, we will then confirm the cervical respiratory responsive loci in humans. Third, we will subject the identified respiratory competent regions to increasing doses of opioid to further characterize the dose-response profile of these regions. Fourth, we will assess the feasibility and practical translation of this strategy to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression in three patients implanted with spinal cord stimulators. These studies will provide an anatomical and electrophysiological characterization of the respiratory circuit within the cervical spine and provide practical information for the treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression. The results obtained, especially because they are obtained in humans, will have an immediate translational impact on our understanding of the respiratory circuit that may, in turn, prevent deaths due to opioid overdose. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid overdose often leads to death due to suppression of respiration; therefore, strategies to prevent respiratory depression in addition to treatment of opioid addiction are necessary to prevent deaths in the opioid-use epidemic. Respiratory suppression occurs because neurons in the brain that drive breathing are inhibited (turned off) by narcotics; thus, understanding the neural pathways for breathing will allow us to devise effective neuromodulatory strategies to treat opioid-induced respiratory depression. We have proposed to characterize a novel breathing circuit that, when activated by stimulation of the cervical spine, has the potential to be an effective treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression, and it is our hope that findings from these studies may lead to new and more effective treatments for respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdoses.",Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression,10176443,R01DA047637,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Cervical spine', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coughing', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Drug Implants', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Monitor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotics', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Respiration', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Respiratory Center', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strenuous Exercise', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Vital Statistics', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mu opioid receptors', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'optogenetics', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'transcutaneous stimulation', 'translational approach', 'translational impact', 'ventilation']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,701059
"Examining feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of a novel personalized smartphone intervention for suicide. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is a serious public health concern in the United States. However, despite an increase in theoretical models of and treatments for suicide, the suicide rate has risen 33% since 1999. Given the widespread availability of smartphone technology, there is great potential to deliver interventions via mobile platforms. However, despite the proliferation of smartphone tools for suicide, few offer evidence-based support and some include potentially harmful content. In response, we have conducted initial development of a mobile suicide prevention system: Mobile Application to Prevent Suicide (MAPS). MAPS was specifically designed to identify increased suicide risk and deliver personalized intervention for patients transitioning out of a psychiatric hospital, a time of extraordinarily high risk. MAPS provides both a mobile app and clinician support, and includes multiple evidence-based components: (1) monitoring of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors via ecological momentary assessment (EMA), (2) personalized, interactive coping strategy administration based on participants’ current risk state, (3) direct access to clinicians and crisis support services, and (4) psychoeducation. We will leverage existing components of MAPS and develop and test new features. To plan for sustainability of MAPS, we will deliver the intervention through the Butler Hospital Transitional Outpatient Program, assigning participants to master’s level hospital clinicians, and convene a Stakeholder Advisory Board with a focus on program sustainability. Specifically, the primary aim of this investigation is to establish feasibility, acceptability, safety, and estimate key parameters for primary outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation and behavior; re-hospitalization), and target mechanisms (i.e., self-monitoring, use of coping strategies, reduction of negative affect, self-efficacy). The ultimate goal of this project is to further develop and refine the MAPS system and engage in preliminary testing in preparation for a fully-powered randomized clinical trial (R01) to establish effectiveness of the intervention in a larger health care system and to further optimize intervention components and delivery (e.g., machine learning techniques). This proposal outlines procedures for intervention and clinician training program refinement through focus groups and open and randomized pilot trials. Thus, the present study is designed to develop the tools, procedures, and knowledge base for a novel intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is a major public health problem, with over 47,000 deaths by suicide per year, and individuals discharged from psychiatric hospitals are at extraordinarily elevated risk for suicide. Currently available treatments for suicide have not led to a decrease in the suicide rate. The primary aim of the present study is leverage existing infrastructure to develop novel technological features for a novel personalized smartphone intervention system, and to establish feasibility, acceptability, safety, and estimate key parameters for primary outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation and behavior; re-hospitalization), and target mechanisms.","Examining feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of a novel personalized smartphone intervention for suicide.",10107455,R34MH124971,"['Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognition', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emotions', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Professional Practice', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care systems', 'clinical practice', 'coping', 'cost', 'critical period', 'design', 'effectiveness study', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'falls', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'outpatient programs', 'personalized care', 'personalized intervention', 'pilot trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychoeducation', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIMH,"BUTLER HOSPITAL (PROVIDENCE, RI)",R34,2021,236986
"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Summary Radiotherapy (RT) is a major component in the treatment of most head and neck cancer (HNC) cases. During irradiation, sensitive regions such as the salivary glands can sustain injury, resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth). This side effect is common and can significantly reduce quality of life during and post-treatment. The focus of this application is prediction during treatment planning of whether patients will suffer high-grade xerostomia (NCI CTCAE Grade 2-3) at the time of their first post-treatment follow-up visit, typically 3-6 months after RT (prevalence is approximately 40%). Predictions will enable clinicians to carry out treatment planning with improved knowledge of the likelihood of high-grade xerostomia development and allow better-informed and more timely anticipation of consequences such as eating difficulty. In this Phase 1 project, Oncospace Inc. will develop a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) prediction model using over 1200 complete HNC patient records. Associations between high-grade xerostomia and a wide range of dosimetric, clinical and demographic features will be automatically discovered and the features with the strongest associations will populate the nodes of a decision tree. The terminal leaf nodes will each contain the probability of high-grade xerostomia for the subset of patients in that node. In addition, leaf nodes will be assigned binary class labels designating a high- or low risk of high-grade xerostomia. This type of model provides transparency and interpretability, which are beneficial for clinical acceptance and for demonstration of safety to regulatory agencies. The software will be built using the Microsoft Azure cloud architecture and be deployed via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. There are three distinct aims of this project:  1. Populate Oncospace Inc.’s Microsoft Azure CosmosDB database with data licensed from Johns Hopkins  University, including steps such as patient de-identification, data curation, and additional dataset feature engineering  2. Perform CART modeling and test model accuracy, using separate training and test datasets and a variety  of performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and F1-score.  3. Design a clinically acceptable risk classification strategy and a user interface (UI) to communicate model  results. Expert input from a team of UI consultants and three radiation oncologists will be an integral part  of the development, testing, and evaluation processes. The successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the clinical and commercial feasibility of a xerostomia prediction model for HNC. Further development in Phase 2 will include deeper model personalization via incorporation of advanced image features (radiomics), as well as validation of model generalizability and commercial viability via the curation and use in model building of data from other institutions. Oncospace, formed in 2018, is uniquely positioned to carry out this work as the team includes the creators of the Pinnacle radiation therapy planning system, Tomotherapy radiation treatment delivery system, and HealthMyne Quantitative Imaging Decision Support platform. Oncospace has close clinical collaboration with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for clinical feedback, validation and initial deployment. Oncospace has licensed three patents and subscription to complete patient treatment records for over 6,000 radiation oncology patients from JHU. The company has won the Microsoft Innovation Acceleration Award for its innovative platform to deliver AI-enabled healthcare solutions to the radiation oncology community. Page 1 of 1 Narrative During standard-of-care radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, the salivary glands often sustain radiation- induced injury leading to xerostomia (dry mouth).

"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,10171859,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'detection sensitivity', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,381543
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing. If successful, this project will reduce the cardiac testing burden and facilitate activation for transplant for patients on the kidney transplant waitlist.",Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates,10189578,K23DK123410,"['Accreditation', 'Age', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Wait Time', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'older patient', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive test', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relative effectiveness', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'skills']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,165725
"Development of quantitative tools to predict patients with difficult intubation to minimize treatment related complications ABSTRACT Endotracheal mouth/nose breathing need 10% this to performing subjective poorly standard Unfortunately, these airway examination systems in clinical practice perform only modestly, with sensitivities of 20-62%, specificities of 82-97%, and very low positive predictive values, generally less than 30%, unless very liberal definitions of difficulty are used. There are likely a number of reasons for this poor performance, including the relative rarity of difficult intubation, the multifactorial etiology and varying definition of difficult intubation, inter-observer variability in test results, failure to validate potential systems in patients independent of those used to derive the test, and the inadequacy of the tests themselves. intubation (EI) is a common medical procedure in which a plastic tube is introduced via the into the trachea, to provide respiratory support during general anesthesia or to ameliorate difficulty in cases of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or other forms of critical illness. The global for EI is likely at least 150 million based on the WHO estimate of surgical need worldwide. Approximately  of EI attempts are difficult, and approximately 1/2000 are deemed impossible. The clinica l significance of “can't intubate, can't ventilate” scenario is extremely important: 25% of anesthetic related deaths are due airway mishaps. Patients are typically assessed for anatomic features that might predict difficulty in EI prior to the procedure. In practice, anesthesiologists and other airway experts likely weigh other factors in anticipating a difficult airway, including habitus, facial appearance, and perhaps other understood hunches. The use of this examination to predict difficult intubation is considered the of care in modern anesthesiology practice.

"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10217254,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,760832
"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on our elderly population living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. In particular, care for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is extremely challenging due to their special needs and difficulty adhering to social distancing requirements. This administrative supplement under the Stanford Aging and Ethogeriatrics (SAGE) Research Center (P30 AG059307) will examine the emotional distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dementia risk in racial minorities. Aim 1 will examine the extent to which COVID-19-imposed emotional distress mediates the association between childhood social distress and late-life increased risk of dementia by race. Aim 2 will examine the mental health and coping strategies of aging minority residents in nursing homes during the COVID- 19 pandemic by recruiting respondents in nursing homes in selected segregated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMAs). These results are expected to shed new light on the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the effects of emotional distress on minorities living with dementia and how coping strategies may help to mitigate that risk and the provision of dementia care. Our results from both Aims will be integrated and complement each other by providing robust statistical evidence on the association between stress and ADRD as well as first-hand evidence and perspectives from residents and caregivers, who are currently at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Project Narrative: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely taking an enormous toll on the mental health of elderly minority patients and their caregivers in long-term care facilities. The results of this administrative supplement project will provide significant insights into the emotional impact of the pandemic on patients with Alzheimer’s and related dementias and ultimately lead to the design of more effective coping strategies for handling stressful events and improve the overall provision of care.",Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE),10268030,P30AG059307,"['Accounting', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Late Effects', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Race', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'aging population', 'comorbidity', 'coping', 'coronavirus disease', 'dementia care', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'emotional distress', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'health economics', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial discrimination', 'racial minority', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'segregation', 'social', 'social stressor']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,197125
"Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest Project Summary In situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest, it is critical to quickly detect the performance of adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) through clinically acceptable pulse rate and blood pressure (BP). However, the detection of adequate CPR can be difficult for someone not trained in first aid. Currently the standard for measuring BP noninvasively is using cuff-based oscillometeric approaches. Attempts at developing these into wearable devices for automated and continuous measurements have proven difficult and so researchers have looked at other methods. However, these methods have not met the criteria for flexibility, accuracy, and low power consumption. This project aims to develop a flexible patch for accurate detection of pulse rate and blood pressure superficially through the radial, brachial, carotid, and/or femoral arteries. Piezoelectric polymers, are inherently flexible and have been used in many applications for pressure sensing, offering great potential for use as a patch-like sensor for monitoring of cardiovascular function. However, in the standard form, the material is not sensitive enough to accurately detect blood pressure. In our lab we have developed a core-shell nanofiber structure of conductive and piezoelectric nanofibers, respectively. The core-shell nanostructure shows a 4.5 times improvement in pressure sensitivity when compared to standard piezoelectric nanofibers and a nearly 40 times improvement when compared to piezoelectric polymer thin films. This improvement in pressure sensitivity should allow for a wearable device composed of these materials to exceed the necessary 35 dB signal to noise ratio required for the accurate detection of pulse wave velocity, a cardiovascular parameter used to determine blood pressure. Coupled with inkjet printing patterning techniques of conductive polymers developed in our lab, we propose to fabricate a novel core-shell nanofiber piezoelectric array in a wearable patch form for cardiovascular monitoring. In order to test this piezoelectric array and develop data-driven algorithms for the detection of blood pressure, testing will occur on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system capable of replicating a human’s diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse rates, and arterial mechanical properties. The blood pressure attainable by the simulated system falls within the AAMI standard benchmark for accuracy and precision for noninvasive blood pressure monitoring of 5 ± 8 mmHg. We will train various regression models using the data generated from this system to relate the detected pulse wave velocities to blood pressure and we will compare the outcomes to commonly used correlation equations. We propose that the fabrication methods we will develop, when coupled together with data-driven algorithms, will allow for the development of a low- power, flexible patch, capable of detecting pulse rate and blood pressure, giving feedback on the adequacy of CPR. Project Narrative This project plans to develop a patch-like sensor for detecting cardiovascular signals including pulse rate and blood pressure for situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest. The proposed research couples a novel core-shell piezoelectric nanostructure with an inkjet printing method for fabricating flexible arrays, to create a new class of wearable patch-like sensors for cardiovascular monitoring. Testing these sensors on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system, will allow for the development of data-driven algorithms to improve the accuracy of these devices, leading to highly accurate, patch-like cardiovascular sensing.",Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest,10288237,R21EB032056,"['Algorithms', 'Arteries', 'Benchmarking', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'First Aid', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Heart Arrest', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ink', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polymers', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pulse Rates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structure', 'Sulfur', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'detection method', 'falls', 'femoral artery', 'first responder', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mechanical properties', 'nanofiber', 'novel', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'polyvinylidene fluoride', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'pulse pressure wave', 'radial artery', 'random forest', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,232061
"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,10083111,R01MH118220,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cervical spine', 'Clinical', 'Confusion', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Economic Models', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Department-based Intervention', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Nursing', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Healthcare', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Standard', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychologist', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Self-Direction', 'Stratification', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'common rule', 'cost', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic evaluation', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care economics', 'high risk', 'implementation barriers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prevent', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,814463

The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,10130714,R01MH118220,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cervical spine', 'Clinical', 'Confusion', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Economic Models', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Department-based Intervention', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Nursing', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Healthcare', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Standard', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychologist', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Self-Direction', 'Stratification', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'common rule', 'cost', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic evaluation', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care economics', 'high risk', 'implementation barriers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prevent', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,231701
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10140420,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2021,248878
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device,10266206,U18TR003812,"['Acute', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 monitoring', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Process', 'Production', 'RADx Radical', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'fight against', 'fighting', 'global health', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nasopharyngeal swab', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'portability', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'respiratory hypoxia', 'screening', 'severe COVID-19', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U18,2021,999775
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,10166912,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2021,678001
"A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30 states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19 hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event. In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during future waves of the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular events (heart damage, stroke, blood clots) appear to be both common and dangerous in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of which patients are at highest risk for these events is a key step to developing better approaches for prevention and treatment. We will combine multiple sources of information, including a large national COVID-19 registry from the American Heart Association, health care data from Medicare, and blood protein levels from patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to identify the factors that are associated with a higher risk of short- and long-term cardiovascular events among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events",10183512,R01HL157530,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American Heart Association', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Embolism', 'Event', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Israel', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocarditis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention approach', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'disease registry', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'heart damage', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'medical information system', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized management', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'rurality', 'socioeconomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,873210
"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,10144423,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes distress', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation design', 'improved', 'in silico', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,592875
"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,10054973,R01MH115922,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Distal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Social Environment', 'Social Processes', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'Violence', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'individual response', 'men', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'physical abuse', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reducing suicide', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,670430
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,10204099,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,378686
"Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients Severe trauma injury renders patients vulnerable to infections and subsequent risk of infections-related outcomes, including multiple organ failure/dysfunction syndrome (MOF/MODS), a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Although it is well-established that infection is a major risk factor for MOF, not all patients who experience nosocomial infections develop MOF, highlighting the importance of considering the underlying molecular biological mechanisms of heterogeneity in susceptibility to MOF development after infections (ie. infections-related MOF). In current clinical practices, MOF-specific score systems based on physiological measurements such as the Denver and Marshall Scores are monitored and used to diagnose patients with MOF after its onset. Here we propose to build prediction models for infections-related MOF before its onset using molecular signatures in order to significantly increase prediction accuracy. Methods of rapid (ie. immediately after the detection of infection) and accurate identification of patients who are highly susceptible to infections- related outcomes are expected to aid in informed decision-making and ensuring appropriate delivery of preventative measures to control MOF incidence. Such methods may thus result in improved health of patients and reduced health care costs. This proposal aims to employ an unbiased computational approach to investigate genome-wide transcriptome profiles and develop a panel of biomarkers to predict infections-related MOF immediately after the detection of infection. Previous transcriptome studies in the context of infections often focus on patient responses to infection. In contrast, we propose to focus on biomarker panel development to predict a specific infections-related adverse outcome before it occurrs. Two Aims are proposed to predict the outcome of infections-related MOF among blunt trauma patients, a population that is highly susceptible to infections. Aim 1: using blood samples from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Study (“Glue Grant”), we will utilize our early blood transcriptome multi-biomarker development machine learning pipeline to build models for prediction of infections-related MOF outcome among a cohort of blunt trauma patients. Aim 2: we will build prediction models using injury severity scores and other common demographic and clinical variables for infections-related MOF and compare their performance with the multi-biomarker model. We hypothesize that, in comparison to models based on clinical scores, our proposed strategy based on transcriptomic signatures will result in an increasingly accurate prediction and, furthermore, provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to MOF after infection. Identification of these molecular mechanisms may ultimately aid in uncovering potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Overall, results from this study may provide the foundation for further studies of infections-related outcome prediction in different blunt trauma cohorts, as well as in cohorts affected by other types of trauma. The methods and findings from this study may also be applicable to other immunocompromised populations, such as cancer patients and post-surgery patients. Severe trauma renders patients immunocompromised and vulnerable to infections that often lead to life- threatening conditions, such as multiple organ failure (MOF). Our study proposes to provide a personalized medicine strategy for rapidly and accurately identifying patients who are at high risk of developing MOF immediately after they experience infection. Early risk profiling will aid clinicians in informed decision-making to improve patient outcomes and may also lead to the development of new preventative methods.",Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients,10126230,R03AI151499,"['APACHE II', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Glossary', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'new therapeutic target', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'rapid technique', 'resilience', 'response', 'response to injury', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000
"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving.

"Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers ABSTRACT  Gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. These patients typically are socioeconomically disadvantaged, with poor access to screening and vaccination. Consequently, they often present with locoregionally advanced disease, for which pelvic radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent cisplatin (i.e., chemoradiotherapy) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of treatment failure. Intensifying treatment through the delivery of chemotherapy doublets, either concurrently or as adjuvant therapy following chemoradiotherapy, is a promising strategy to improve outcomes. However, the delivery of intensive chemotherapy is complicated by high rates of gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoradiotherapy are needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue including bowel, bone marrow, bone, bladder, and rectum, leading to preventable radiation-induced toxicity. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can improve target localization and dosimetry, optimizing target dose while minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. However, IGRT can be highly resource intensive, and comparative effectiveness trials have been lacking. For this reason, there is considerable controversy as to the utility of IG-IMRT in this disease. Our research group has been at the forefront of developing novel, cost-effective IGRT approaches with wide potential to facilitate better delivery of concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.  Previously we have found that radiation-induced injury to hematopoietically active bone marrow is a critical determinant of tolerance to intensive chemotherapy. Using machine learning methods, we recently developed a multi-atlas-based IGRT method that can predict canonical distributions of active bone marrow, which can obviate the need for positron emission tomography (PET) in settings where this technology is unavailable or unaffordable. The proposed new research will study the ability of multi-atlas-based IGRT to reduce hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to standard treatment, using data from 450 patients enrolled to a randomized phase III trial (NRG-GY006). Furthermore, we will use serial whole body PET/CT to study the impact of radiation dose and chemotherapy intensity on the compensatory hematopoietic response, and have developed novel whole body radiomics biomarkers to quantify the inflammatory state, which we hypothesize can influence patients' outcomes and tolerance to chemotherapy.  The new research extends our work associated with a current R01 grant (1R01CA197059-01) to conduct correlative science associated with the GY006 trial. The overarching goal of this research line is to augment the therapeutic ratio of chemoradiotherapy for pelvic cancers using advanced image-guided radiation techniques. If successful, this research would significantly alter the approach to the treatment of many pelvic malignancies for which chemoradiotherapy is standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this study, we will test the ability of a novel method called multi-atlas-based image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to reduce acute hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to conventional RT, which could obviate the need for expensive functional imaging in socioeconomically disadvantaged and resource constrained populations, such as patients with gynecologic cancers. In addition, we will use serial positron emission tomography to study effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the subacute compensatory hematopoietic response, and will seek to develop and validate novel whole body radiomics models of the inflammatory state as predictive biomarkers for gynecologic cancers. We are in an optimal situation to conduct impactful and innovative research in the context of an ongoing phase III cooperative group randomized registration trial (NRG GY006), affording us the opportunity to conduct rigorous correlative science on a large sample with high data quality, quality assurance, and carefully controlled treatment effects.",Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers,10108128,R01CA255780,"['Acute', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Cisplatin', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intestines', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Cancer', 'Pelvis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data quality', 'dosimetry', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'quality assurance', 'radiation-induced injury', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,276286
"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions. In this proposal, the fields of computer science, machine learning, constrained optimization and clinical science are united to develop a novel decision support tool for multiple daily injection users. This is accomplished in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,10126842,F31DK121436,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Assimilations', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical Technology', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Running', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Study Subject', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'computer science', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'dosage', 'e-commerce', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'glucose disposal', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insulin sensitivity', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,51036
"A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a group of progressive, terminal illnesses that will affect an estimated 14-million people in the United States by the year 2050. Caregivers experience chronic stress and they report feeling burdened and unprepared for making difficult end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, which may lead to unnecessary hospitalizations or avoidable transitions in care that affect end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL). Advance care planning (ACP), which improves EOL-QOL, is the gold-standard approach for improving concordance between preferences and actual care received at EOL. However, despite decades of research aimed at raising their rates, only 50% of those with AD/ADRD have a written ACP. Furthermore, there is a lack of current research evidence investigating the factors associated with transitions in care and EOL-QOL for persons with AD/ADRD, which could help guide EOL decision-making. To date, the state of the science is primarily cross-sectional in nature, and does not account for the influence of trajectories of decline, the effect these changes have on caregivers, nor how longitudinal changes in caregiving ultimately affect EOL care outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need to discover new approaches for preparing persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making informed, in-the-moment decisions, to ensure high EOL-QOL care and to support appropriate transitions in care as circumstances change over time. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study on Caregiving (NSOC), we plan to use a machine learning based framework to identify the key determinants for predicting the risk for EOL care transitions and the traits of EOL-QOL among older adults residing in the community. This study has two specific aims: 1) Develop predictive model of factors related to end-of-life care transitions (e.g. inpatient death versus hospice) in persons with AD/ADRD longitudinally; and 2) Develop a predictive model of factors related to end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) in persons with AD/ADRD. Discovering knowledge in a large population- level dataset is foundational for the future development of a generalizable/scalable model for guiding persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers as they navigate a fragmented healthcare system while making difficult decisions for their loved ones. Our approach fills a critical gap between the current approaches for improving EOL-QOL and EOL transitions in care that focus on ACP as a singular outcome, by addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers that change over time. Our study will provide a predictive model for EOL-QOL and EOL care transitions. This is a critical first step for the future development of an approach for personalizing care to guide persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making EOL care decisions. These results will have an important positive impact on EOL care, which aligns with the strategic goals of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) and Nursing Research (NINR) to address clinical and translational gaps in the study of EOL care needs of people with AD/ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are at high risk for experiencing burdensome care transitions, avoidable hospitalizations, and poor end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) due to the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic illness and escalating demands placed on caregivers, resulting in significant personal and public socioeconomic burdens. Decades of research has focused on improving the rates of advance care plans above 50% among persons with AD/ADRD, however, others may benefit more from personalized guidance to help navigate the trajectory of decline that supports timely, “in the moment” medical decision making. This study addresses Goals 2 and 3 of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease to enhance care quality and efficiency and expand support for persons with AD/ADRD by identifying factors related to poor EOL-QOL and care transitions in the context of caregiving for the future development of a personalized approach to support in the moment healthcare decision-making.",A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life,10162470,R03AG067159,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospice Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Terminal Disease', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'inpatient service', 'loved ones', 'novel strategies', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'secondary analysis', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R03,2021,79750
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,10217235,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,172800
"Diversity Supplement to Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark’s population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD and mortality later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis- generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation.

"Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses Five to 10% of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) die before age 30, but our ability to predict which patients will experience death, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (DVTF) is limited. The optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), which may delay DVTF, is also not clear. The current best predictors of DVTF and guidance for PVR timing rely on “traditional” measures such as right ventricular volume and ejection fraction, which are derived from cardiac MRI (CMR). However, even the best DVTF models have limited predictive power, and these “traditional” volumetric measures fail to predict appropriate response to PVR for 30-40% of patients. This proposal aims to address the critical need for CMR based- metrics that correlate with DVTF and predict response to PVR better than traditional ventricular volumetrics. This will be accomplished through the development of ventricular deformation-, kinematic-, and geometry- based mechanics metrics for rTOF patients from routinely acquired, standard of care CMR datasets, which would allow rapid implementation in clinical practice. The critical need will be addressed through two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop and evaluate novel CMR-based predictors of clinical outcomes in patients with rTOF. Specific Aim 2: Prospectively assess ventricular geometry-based predictors of response to pulmonary valve replacement in rTOF patients. The rationale is that if computational modeling techniques can generate metrics that outperform traditional markers, they can be used to change current patient management with the eventual goal to delay DVTF. The failure to develop improved metrics will lead to continued excess mortality and suboptimal clinical outcomes for patients with rTOF. The combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches allows a more comprehensive assessment of CMR metrics in a population where randomized controlled trials are not feasible. This work has the potential for rapid implementation and thus to mark a paradigm shift in the use of computational modeling in clinical cardiology. The candidate’s career goal is to be an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary research teams to develop new, more accurate, and easily applied outcome predictors for congenital heart disease (CHD). This would place him at the nexus of clinical pediatric cardiology, biomedical engineering, and computer science. To achieve this goal, he will learn about machine learning and kinematic analyses, their strengths and pitfalls, and the data characteristics needed for these analyses. He will learn how to bring his findings to clinical practice and design studies using the newly developed metrics. He will then design R01-funded research to prospectively assess the performance of the ventricular mechanical metrics to guide PVR and predict DVTF. This will all be accomplished through a dedicated, multi-disciplinary mentor/advisor team, a supportive academic environment, and didactic and hands-on training. At the completion of this training, the applicant plans to be a world leader in the application of advanced imaging analytics for congenital heart disease. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because patients with tetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease affecting ~1:2500 babies, have increased risk of heart failure and premature death despite excellent initial surgery. Development of non-invasive, easily obtained, and rapidly implemented metrics of ventricular mechanics are needed to improve prediction of death and allow optimization of pulmonary valve replacement timing. This project is relevant to the NHLBI’s mission because the tools developed here, and the skills learned, could then be applied to other forms of congenital and structural heart disease, and promote longer and more fulfilling lives for patients.","Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses",10127094,K23HL150279,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'EFRAC', 'Environment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tetralogy of Fallot', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'design', 'early experience', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'premature', 'prospective', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'repaired', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'vector']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,169351
"Mentoring Patient Oriented Research in Innovative Imaging and High-dimensional Data Approaches to Improve Outcomes in Cardiac Amyloidosis Project Summary/Abstract Dr Sharmila Dorbala is an Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a physician/scientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). She has devoted her career to patient-oriented research focusing on cardiac amyloidosis. She contributed independently to the field of cardiac amyloidosis through a succession of substantive studies utilizing molecular imaging to phenotype cardiac amyloidosis in order to diagnose and manage this condition. Her research program is impactful, both directly and through effective mentoring of the next generation of amyloidosis investigators. Dr. Dorbala has successfully mentored 26 pre- and post-doctoral trainees in patient- oriented research projects. She is currently PI of two active NIH R01 grants and also has funding from AHA and foundation/industrial sources. Her program provides a unique opportunity for POR due to the intersection of resources from programs in clinical investigation at the Harvard School of Public Health and the BWH cardiovascular imaging T32 program. Her mentees have presented their work nationally and internationally, published papers, and won research awards and pilot grants. The new research aims proposed in this award lay the foundation for adjunct interventions to enhance transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) therapies and novel image-based personalized strategies to predict treatment failure. She will assess (1) sonoporation, a therapeutic ultrasound technique to increase myocardial perfusion and, consequently, improve delivery of antifibril drugs; (2) shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome to inform development of nutrition-based adjunct therapies; (3) radiomics of 99mTc- pyrophosphate SPECT/CT to assess treatment response, and (4) machine learning based CT-derived sarcopenia metric to predict survival. This research has important clinical implications. Currently approved TTR stabilizing/silencing drugs, though lifesaving for most, are not effective in about 30% of patients. Moreover, while these therapies improve clinical outcomes, they do not treat amyloid fibril. Fibril-targeted therapies have been unsuccessful to date, probably because of poor interstitial drug delivery due to the presence of fibril. The results of the proposed mentoring and research activities of this K24 project are likely to not only substantially improve outcomes and alleviate HF symptoms in these gravely ill patients, but also transform her patient- oriented research program into a formal individualized program of mentoring with a focus on preventing heart failure from amyloidosis. Project Narrative Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, a particularly deadly form of heart failure, can now be treated by recently developed medications. The proposed projects will develop new heart imaging approaches to determine who is likely to respond to the new medicines, test a new ultrasound-based therapy to improve blood flow to the heart muscle and thereby improve delivery of novel drugs to the heart, and study bacteria in the stool with the goal of eventually developing diet-based strategies to address cardiac amyloidosis. In developing methods to improve treatments for amyloidosis, this project will support expansion of Dr. Dorbala’s patient oriented research program and enhance training for her mentees.",Mentoring Patient Oriented Research in Innovative Imaging and High-dimensional Data Approaches to Improve Outcomes in Cardiac Amyloidosis,10191887,K24HL157648,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Ammonia', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Amyloidosis', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Volume', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diphosphates', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'EFRAC', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prealbumin', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Protein Precursors', 'Proteins', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient', 'Symptoms', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data registry', 'effective therapy', 'extracellular', 'fecal microbiota', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'hazard', 'heart imaging', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'medical schools', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'mid-career faculty', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrition', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized strategies', 'pre-doctoral', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'sonoporation', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'β-amyloid burden']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2021,121599
"Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations Project Summary/Abstract Significant health disparities exist in chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in ethnically diverse populations. African Americans (AAs) have ~25% higher prevalence of CKD, 3-fold higher rate of ESRD, and the highest risk of mortality among those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45-95mL/min/1.73m2. The most significant traditional risk factors for CKD and ESRD are diabetes and hypertension accounting for >60% CKD and >70% of new ESRD cases, respectively. Non- traditional risk factors for CKD such as environmental, cultural-behavioral factors, geographic, education, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status and unequal access to optimal healthcare, disproportionately affect CKD health in ethnic minorities. The unique combination of these factors on CKD progression in the real world remains poorly defined. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may reduce CKD disparities would be invaluable to improve quality of life, life expectancy, and decrease economic burden. Simulation models have been successfully applied in other clinical domains, but are limited in CKD development and CKD progression, due to small datasets and the absence of modeling techniques using longitudinal observational health data. Further, no models have been tested in a real-world minority population to uncover the potential for interventional studies that would reduce CKD disparities on a larger scale. To our knowledge, we have created the largest, comprehensive database from electronic health records of >10 million individuals seen between 2006-2016 from a 2-year partnership between UCLA (1.8 million) and Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH; 9.2 million) systems. From the UCLA Registry population, we identified significant differences in eGFR trajectory decline between AAs and non-AAs according to baseline eGFR, indicating a pattern shift from a higher to a lower, steeper eGFR trajectory suggesting there may be critical windows for interventions to reduce CKD disparities in AAs. Race/ethnicity differences from linear mixed models of all ethnic cohorts persisted even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence eGFR trajectories. We hypothesize that the use of ethnically diverse populations in the joint UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry can identify a novel combination of CKD risk factors; and improve the performance of existing simulation models to predict CKD progression. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a machine learning-based simulation model for CKD and eGFR trajectories using the UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry; and conduct internal validation of the models and comparisons with existing CKD risk models, 2) stratify and test simulation models based on different racial/ethnic groups, including external validation based on cross-institution comparisons, and 3) conduct focus groups with UCLA primary care physicians, who manage racial/ethnic patients, to elicit their perspectives on existing and designed simulation models to reduce CKD health disparities. These innovative approaches will facilitate our long-term goal to inform clinical decision support methods to reduce/eliminate CKD health disparities. Project Narrative Disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affect the development of CKD and CKD progression in ethnic minorities. The ability to use large datasets of patient information to reduce these disparities is greatly lacking. We will conduct simulation modeling to identify a unique set of risk factors that predict CKD and CKD progression, that can be targeted for individualized treatment in patients with highest risk of kidney function decline, with valuable input on the potential utility of this resource from focus groups consisting of primary care physicians.",Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations,10087957,R01MD014712,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Statistics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Urban Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'disease registry', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'minority health', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,374941
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,10161608,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,787916
"A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care Candidate: April Jorge, MD is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and an Assistant in Medicine in the Rheumatology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). After graduating from the University of Maryland magna cum laude, she received her MD from Georgetown University, and she completed her internal medicine residency at Northwestern University. She completed her rheumatology fellowship at MGH, during which she also completed the Harvard Catalyst Clinical and Translational Research Academy and began working with Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH. Dr. Jorge's prior work has resulted in 15 peer- reviewed original papers, with 13 as the first author or co-first author. Her goal is to become an independent investigator and innovative leader in patient-oriented research of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mentorship, Training Activities, and Environment: Dr. Jorge will conduct the proposed project at MGH under the mentorship of Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH and co-mentorship of Karen Costenbader, MD, MPH and Karen Sepucha, PhD. Dr. Choi is a world-renowned, NIH-funded physician scientist in advanced clinical epidemiology of rheumatic conditions, ranging from common disorders to rare but serious disorders (e.g., SLE). He has served as a mentor for several prior K awardees. Dr. Costenbader is a clinical investigator and expert in SLE who is also an experienced mentor of K awardees. Dr. Sepucha is a leading expert in patient-centered decision science. Dr. Jorge's research will also benefit from the specific expertise of her key collaborators, including advanced clinical epidemiology methods, machine learning prediction algorithms, and decision- analytic modeling. In addition to receiving excellent mentorship, she will acquire new skills through didactics in advanced clinical epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology, risk prediction, eliciting patient preferences with a mixed methods research approach, and decision-analytic modeling. Research: SLE carries increased risks of multiple comorbidities and double the risk of death compared to the general population. Current treatment is limited in part by few proven medications and adverse treatment effects. The central goal of this research is to improve long-term SLE outcomes by integrating personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient-centered use of key lupus medications. To achieve this goal, she will risk stratify patients for potential harms of treatment, i.e., hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection with belimumab use versus other immunosuppressants, and other adverse outcomes, i.e., severe COVID-19 infection (Aim 1). She will elicit patient preferences for SLE treatment through a discrete choice experiment (Aim 2a) and will integrate patient preferences with personalized risks through a multi-criteria decision analysis to determine the optimal hydroxychloroquine dose in SLE care (Aim 2b). Completion of this proposal and training plan will position Dr. Jorge with the vital experience to become an independent clinical investigator in patient-oriented research of SLE. Project Narrative Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous systemic condition associated with serious morbidity and premature mortality, yet treatment options are limited. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of the two FDA-approved lupus medications, hydroxychloroquine and belimumab, due in part to the risks of adverse treatment effects including hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection. This Career Development Award focuses on applying advanced clinical epidemiology and patient-centered decision science to integrate personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient- centered use of key lupus medications, including specifically the optimal dose of hydroxychloroquine in SLE care.","A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care",10192142,K23AR079040,"['Academy', 'Adverse effects', 'Award', 'Azathioprine', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fellowship', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harm Reduction', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Internal Medicine', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycophenolate', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Premature Mortality', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'belimumab', 'care outcomes', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'data access', 'dosage', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'severe COVID-19', 'skills', 'therapy adverse effect', 'trend']",NIAMS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,174960
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),10141287,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,652539
"Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery ABSTRACT Neonates (infants ≤ 28 days), especially those with congenital heart disease (CHD), are among the most vulnerable populations cared for by critical care nurses. Approximately, two out of three CHD neonates experience unintentional hypothermia after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Unintentional hypothermia impairs cellular function, which can be linked to poor outcomes frequently reported in this population. To date, there are no studies examining the association between the burden of unintentional hypothermia and clinical outcomes in neonates with CHD. This knowledge would render future opportunities to improve nursing care and prevent avoidable safety events in these vulnerable neonates. To address this gap, we propose to use retrospective data from CardioAccess (database local to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia [CHOP]), which includes one of the largest multicenter repositories of neonatal cardiac surgery data available to date (Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium [PC4]), as well as, the electronic health record. Using data from at least 432 neonates who have undergone CPB between 2015 and 2019, we will quantify the time course of hourly temperature trajectories within the initial 24–48 hours after CPB and evaluate their relation to key clinical outcomes. We will specifically study the temporal trends of unintentional hypothermia burden (temperature depth and duration), which challenges current practice, where care is based on maintaining a single, preselected temperature threshold that is driven by consensus, rather than evidence. Single threshold values are not dynamic representations of the complexity that makes up temperature. A more robust output, such as an accumulative hypothermia burden index, is needed to assist clinicians with interpretation of this dynamic indicator of overall health. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Identify distinct temporal temperature patterns in CHD neonates after CPB using both: a multilevel model for intensive longitudinal data with group-based trajectory modeling; and an unsupervised machine learning technique using principal component analysis followed by k- means clustering of longitudinal data. 2) Determine the relationship between hypothermia burden subgroups / clusters and important clinical outcomes in this population. Our team has a demonstrated expertise in building clinically relevant and physiologically plausible markers of adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. This study aligns with the NINR’s priorities of promoting wellness and preventing illness across the lifespan, as well as, using recent advances in precision medicine. The research conducted under this award will take place at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing, a research-intensive institution (data analysis), and CHOP (data provision). The personalized training plan outlined in this application, supports the applicant’s career and academic development goals to become an independent nurse researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Unintentional hypothermia can significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD), which has a prevalence at birth in the USA of ~1% or 40,000 cases per year, and of those, ~6,000 neonates are born with severe defects requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, contributing to a total cost of ~$5.6 billion every year. This will be the first clinical study to define the prevalence of unintentional hypothermia and map its association to neonatal outcomes with CHD, which has major implications for clinical practice. Unveiling the prevalence and consequences of unintentional hypothermia in this vulnerable population will render future opportunities to enhance time to recognition and early choice of preemptive intervention, which can improve the quality and safety of care, save lives and productivity, as well as, health care dollars.",Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery,10233671,F31NR019725,"['Address', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consensus', 'Cost of Illness', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Integumentary system', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'PC4 Gene', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Philadelphia', 'Physiological', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Respiratory distress', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Safety', 'School Nursing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical Wound Infection', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight Gain', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'critical care nursing', 'database query', 'early onset', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multilevel analysis', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonate', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prevent', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2021,48536
"AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore, the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological, mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians rely on a “trial-and-error” approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2) yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it aims to better understand neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation in patients with Usher syndrome (USH) – an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness. Results from this study will have a broad impact on the field by 1) establishing how cochlear nerve degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, 2) identifying tests that distinctly evaluate the loss in the spiral ganglion cells vs the loss in the peripheral axon, and 3) yielding an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neural interface in all cochlear implant users. Results from this study will also have a targeted impact on implanted patients with USH by laying the groundwork for developing an effective, evidence-based clinical practice for managing these patients. This project is relevant to the mission of NIH because it seeks fundamental knowledge about the nature of electrical hearing in patients with USH and strives to apply this knowledge to reduce disability in all patients with cochlear implants.",AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME,10192995,R21DC019458,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory system', 'Axon', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Nerve', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Deterioration', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Interphase', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery of Function', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Usher Syndrome', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'daily functioning', 'deaf', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'ganglion cell', 'hearing impairment', 'histological studies', 'individual patient', 'model development', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron loss', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'point of care', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'restoration', 'spiral ganglion', 'supervised learning', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,196406
"Augmented Reality Platform for Telehealth Rehabilitiation Efforts to keep the most vulnerable individuals with chronic medical conditions from being exposed to COVID- 19 have triggered an unprecedented decline in the number of visits to ambulatory practices. The repercussions have impacted not only those with the disease, but the many millions of older persons in need of healthcare who forego in-person visits in fear of infection or for socioeconomic reasons. While the precipitating need for alternative healthcare delivery methods has hastened the adoption of software solutions, such as Zoom, traditional videoconferencing services fail to compensate for the lack of direct physical evaluations with a patient that is needed for evaluating musculoskeletal (MSK) deficits, planning therapeutic interventions, and guiding exercise compliance—essential components of evidence-based practice among rehabilitation practitioners. To overcome these shortcomings, our team of computer vision and human movement engineers is partnering with orthopedic rehabilitation specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to develop a telehealth platform that fuses high resolution RGB and Depth (RGD-D) video data readily obtainable from a modern smartphone to facilitate quantitative, MSK assessment. The innovation builds upon our work in computing movement outcome measures from vision-based body tracking algorithms, and our skills in augmented reality (AR) software development to enhance a clinician’s assessment and exercise instruction capabilities. Our pilot data demonstrate that accurate quantitative rehabilitation outcomes are obtainable using RGB-D body tracking algorithms during a sub-set of knee activities. Phase I will advance these capabilities by deriving and validating the accuracy of 3D body tracking and rehabilitation outcome measures during a wider set of activities used clinically for assessing knee mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength, and function from depth enabled smartphone video recordings in control subjects (Aim 1). Aim 2 will develop a proof-of-concept AR telehealth platform with the help of the MGH team that delivers an enhanced telehealth experience through real-time synchronized audio-visual processing, real-time display of quantitative rehabilitation outcomes for the therapist to assess deficits or guide exercise compliance, and instructional animations for the patient to safely carry out the rehabilitation activities. The proof-of-concept prototype will undergo feasibility testing in Aim 3 among n=5 physical therapists and n=10 patients with knee OA during a simulated telehealth session to achieve high ratings for usability, accessibility, and effectiveness. The results will inform the user-requirements of a more complete Phase II telehealth platform designed in close collaboration with industry partners to provide secure cloud based communication for seamless interoperability between devices; additional examination tools (e.g. gait analysis); a broader range of baseline assessment and therapeutic exercise protocols for additional MSK conditions; and HIPAA-compliant deployment and electronic documentation management. The final prototype system will be evaluated during actual telehealth visits at multiple clinical sites to promote safe and effective clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical care has by necessity shifted towards telehealth delivery for people at risk due to age, who live in underserved communities or avoid in-person visits out of fear of viral transmission. Existing telehealth software platforms are generally supportive of videoconferencing but have yet to provide rehabilitation professionals with quantitative outcomes typically obtained from direct physical evaluations with a patient. To overcome this shortcoming, we are developing an augmented reality platform that fuses RGB and depth imaging from a patient’s smartphone to deliver quantitative outcomes of knee joint mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength and function during a telehealth visit to support the mandate for more effective remote delivery of evidence-based rehabilitation during the global pandemics and beyond.",Augmented Reality Platform for Telehealth Rehabilitiation,10256844,R43AG072991,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Augmented Reality', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quarantine', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic exercise', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videoconferencing', 'Virtual Tool', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animation', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cloud based', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'gait examination', 'health care delivery', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'joint mobilization', 'new technology', 'outpatient programs', 'pandemic disease', 'partial recovery', 'patient safety', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'remote delivery', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'software development', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'underserved community', 'usability', 'viral transmission', 'visual processing']",NIA,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2021,286972
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (HTx) is a well-established life-saving procedure but is associated with severe complications. Current clinical monitoring algorithms rely on frequent invasive procedures including endomyocardial biopsies and catheter angiography. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed non-invasive comprehensive cardiac MRI, which can quantify regional changes in myocardial tissue and function. Our efforts have focused on the 2 major complications of HTx: 1) acute cardiac rejection (ACR), the leading cause of death in the first year after transplant; and 2) cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality beyond the first post-Tx year. Our cardiac MRI studies have identified new imaging biomarkers in HTx. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between abnormal cardiac MRI measures and potential allograft failure: myocardial T2 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as non-invasive tissue biomarkers for ACR. We demonstrated that the natural history of myocardial scarring, T2, and ECV predicts adverse clinical events in HTx recipients. In addition, our studies showed that donor and recipient mismatch (age, sex, weight, etc.) was significantly associated with cardiac MRI-derived measures of myocardial edema/inflammation, fibrosis, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Over the past five years, the PIs have assembled a unique study database with over >450 comprehensive cardiac MRI exams comprising >110,000 annotated cardiac MRI images. For this renewal application, we identified the need to conduct further long-term follow-up studies tailored to the slow disease progression in HTx to identify changes over time in multiparametric MRI measures and predictors of HTx outcome. Second, data on graft tissue and function in the pediatric HTx population are scarce and improved strategies for donor-recipient matching in this vulnerable population are needed to make most efficient use of the limited availability of donor hearts in children. Thus, cardiac MRI needs to better account for age and sex related differences in patient habitus and physiology, critical for the wide age range in HTx from pediatric to adult. The renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop multiparametric cardiac MRI for the assessment of graft tissue (T2, T1, ECV), and dysfunction (myocardial velocities, strain) from pediatric to adult, 2) leverage the existing large cardiac MRI database (110,000 labeled cardiac MRI images) to establish deep learning based analysis pipelines for automated cardiac MRI analysis with improved efficiency and reduced inter-rater variability, 3) to identify predictors of adverse outcomes and to evaluate the impact of donor-recipient mismatch on graft tissue, function, and flow in a prospective study with pediatric HTx patients, and 4) to identify cardiac metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) HTx patient outcome by leveraging our HTx database (>145 HTx recipients with existing baseline cardiac MRI acquired during the initial funding cycle). Follow-up cardiac MRI will provide unique insights in changes over time in graft tissue and function as mechanism underlying different HTx patient trajectories (non-progression vs. late onset vs. slow progression vs. fast progression). PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop multiparametric cardiac MRI and automated deep learning based cardiac MRI analysis workflows for improved assessment for complications after heart transplantation, the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage heart failure. Cardiac MRI will be developed to allow for efficient application from pediatric to adult patients in order to evaluate its diagnostic value for non-invasively detecting complications and to investigate the impact of differences in heart donor and recipient characteristics on the performance of the transplanted heart. In addition, we will leverage an existing large cardiac MRI database to allow for long-term 5-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management in heart transplant recipients.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,10208494,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Angiography', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease Progression', 'Donor Selection', 'Donor person', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Label', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplantation Surgery', 'Transplanted Heart Complication', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Ventricular', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost estimate', 'deep learning', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'graft failure', 'health care service utilization', 'heart allograft', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tissue biomarkers', 'transplant database', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,695340
"Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD Project Summary This proposal for a mentored career development award consists of a training and research plan devised to facilitate Dr. David Jacobs' transition to an independent investigator focusing on the implementation of medication use interventions during the transition from hospital to home for high-needs patients. Dr. Jacobs is a clinical pharmacist with an advanced degree in epidemiology and health services and has significant experience conducting clinical research. The candidate's current research is focused on transition of care interventions. Given the resource intensive nature of these interventions, the sustainability of these programs will heavily depend on identifying and targeting patients at high-risk for hospital readmission. To anticipate such admissions, predictive models have been developed; however, our ability to predict hospital readmissions remains poor. This is likely because detailed social information, which is disproportionately represented in high-needs populations, is typically absent in risk stratification tools. Therefore, the long-term research objective is to build predictive models that combine social information with rich clinical data to individualize care management interventions and reduce readmissions. The specific aims are: (i) to determine social risk factors driving hospital readmissions by conducting semi-structured interviews with patients, their caregivers, and clinicians; (ii) to develop a risk- prediction model using advanced informatics techniques; and (iii) to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot intervention aimed at improving transition strategies. This work will focus on a singular complex condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in developing a risk stratification tool in order to improve its predictive performance for identifying high-risk patients. COPD will serve as the model condition since it is one of the major readmission diagnoses, and there exists a high level of complexity following hospital discharge at patients' care transition. This award will provide the applicant with mentor-guided didactic and experiential learning to address the following career development objectives: 1) gain experiential learning in qualitative methodology, 2) advance his knowledge in biomedical informatics and develop predictive models integrating high-dimensional electronic health record data, and 3) increase his understanding of implementation science and gain practical experience in conducting a pragmatic clinical trial. The primary mentor, Dr. Sanjay Sethi, and the mentorship team will work closely to monitor his progress toward independence and will provide him with the guidance and the resources to guarantee his success. The proposed study leverages the extensive resources available at the University at Buffalo to address an important public health issue. Achieving the proposed aims and acquiring these advanced skills will position the candidate to submit successful R01s testing the proposed clinical prediction model and transition strategy in real-world settings. In summary, a comprehensive career development plan in the context of a well-defined training, research, and mentorship structure will allow Dr. Jacobs to emerge as a highly successful, independent clinician-investigator in health services research. Project Narrative Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are discharged from the hospital have high rates of early readmission; these readmissions are a significant burden to the health care system. The proposed research will combine social information with rich clinical data to develop a real-time readmission risk prediction algorithm that will be integrated into a patient-centric intervention and tested in real-world clinical practice settings. The information learned from this project will assist in providing individualized treatment at the transition from hospital to home and focused on reducing healthcare utilization and ultimately improving quality of care.",Integrative Informatics Approach to Predict Readmissions and Improve Outcomes in COPD,10215337,K23HL153582,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Buffaloes', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'biomedical informatics', 'care coordination', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient safety', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'practice setting', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'social', 'social disadvantage', 'social factors', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NHLBI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,K23,2021,192411

"A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications, risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices. We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and the quality of care provided for the patients. We propose to create an Implant Registry capturing implant therapy that is provided by practitioners within the NDPBRN. The aim is to determine the therapies associated with the greatest amount of success and the least amount of complications. With the data generated through this registry, we will add to the generalizable knowledge about implant therapy, the complications and therapies associated with implant success at the fixture level and the patient level.",A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network,10101988,UG3DE030090,"['Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Implants', 'Dentistry', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Esthetics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral health', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'data registry', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health related quality of life', 'medical specialties', 'peri-implant bone loss', 'peri-implantitis', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'practice-based research network', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,UG3,2021,202410
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,10178076,R01HL140362,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Environment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Height', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nurses', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'community setting', 'complex data', 'computer science', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'lung injury', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'respiratory', 'response', 'theories', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2021,680901
"Synchronized brain dynamics and eye movement trajectory for objective evaluation of robot-assisted surgical skills Complicated and costly robot assisted surgery (RAS) training results in less frequent use of this technology in several complex areas of surgery, and consequently ends up in harm. RAS requires a unique blend of skills in addition to manual competence with human-machine interaction skills, while operating remotely from patient with no tactile feedback. To address this challenge, numerous studies have focused on simulation-based robotic training curricula, like Fundamental Skills of Robotic Surgery (FSRS), to develop and assess the performance level of the surgeon operator. However, such training tools were developed based on metrics measured by performance on a simulator and other subjectively evaluated metrics. The goal of this research proposal is to develop a tool for objective RAS skill assessment and a model for performance monitoring. We hypothesize that brain dynamics - Electroencephalogram (EEG) - and eye movement behavior are able to detect change of skill level and the level of surgeon’s performance. To validate this hypothesis, we will record EEG signals and eye movement time series from subjects with different RAS expertise levels. Ten novices, 5 beginners, 5 advanced beginners, and 5 expert surgeons will be included in the study and continuously perform four levels of designed RAS training tasks on surgical robot simulator, dry lab, and animal lab during one year; (1) performing six basic tasks on surgical simulator. All subjects will practice these tasks during two weekly sessions and each practice session takes 2 hours. (2) Subjects will practice 3 tasks of peg transfer, pattern cutting, and suturing on dry lab. (3) Subjects will practice 2 tasks (anastomosis and dissection) on animal tissue and also on plastic models. (4) Subjects will practice two operations of nephrectomy and hysterectomy on animal lab, 2 operations in each session, and each session takes 3 hours and occurs every other week. Two master surgeons will subjectively evaluate performance of subjects (all 25 subjects; Score scale: 1-20) and expertise level (four categories) in performing the designed tasks, every practice session. Master surgeons evaluate surgeon’s skill and performance throughout task and notify change of skill level and performance through time. We will then develop a ‘deep convolutional neural network’ algorithm trained by EEG and eye movement time series through running windows with equal size, to classify subject skill level into four categories of a novice, beginner, advanced beginner, and expert. We will also use network neuroscience techniques to extract engineered features from EEG and eye movement data and use them for training a regression algorithm to develop a model for performance level prediction. Ultimately, the developed objective skill evaluation tool and performance monitoring model will make RAS training more efficient by providing feedback to the trainee regarding his/her skills and directing him/her to focus on skills needed improvement. These improvements will result in more frequent use of RAS in complex surgical areas and ultimately lead to patient safety. Project Narrative The use of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has offered advantages for surgeons and patients, yet there is no clinically practical tool for objective evaluation of subject’s expertise level and performance. The overall objective of this research is to develop a tool for objective RAS skill assessment and a model for performance monitoring, leading to optimized RAS training process, improved patient safety and surgical outcomes.",Synchronized brain dynamics and eye movement trajectory for objective evaluation of robot-assisted surgical skills,10133651,R01EB029398,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Nephrectomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wrist', 'adaptive learning', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'animal tissue', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'gaze', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'motor learning', 'neural network algorithm', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'regression algorithm', 'robot assistance', 'robotic device', 'robotic training', 'safety outcomes', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NIBIB,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2021,385213
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data repository', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110
"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF) ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over 130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States. This cross-cohort collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of sex and racial/ethnic health disparities in HF. Causal mediation analysis techniques will be used to estimate the degree to which single and multi-factor lifestyle and clinical interventions could potentially reduce health disparities in HF. In our phenomapping aim, we will define unique clinically relevant phenotypes of HF based upon cohort data that is also commonly present in medical records for enhanced generalizability, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, clinical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, ejection fraction, physiologic measures, and co-morbidities; we will also evaluate HF phenotype associations with CVD and all-cause mortality. NARRATIVE This Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross-Cohort Collaboration study will evaluate the magnitude and potential causes of racial/ethnic and sex disparities in incident heart failure and its subtypes and their prognosis in over 130,000 men and women from 10 pooled cohorts.

"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10122993,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579032
"Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI) Project Summary Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection and a significant driver of poor patient outcomes and preventable cost. An existing bundle of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) methods of CDI prevention are limited by difficulties identifying high-risk patients most likely to benefit from interventions. Recently we have developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately identify risk of developing CDI in hospitalized patients. Here we propose adding and rigorously testing this highly innovative precision medicine approach to CDI prevention within a robust, real-world AMS infrastructure Objective: To decrease CDI incidence by implementing an electronic health record-integrated CDI-risk classification tool within a framework of precision-medicine AMS. Specific Aim: Measure the effect of implementing a real-time CDI-risk classification tool to guide AMS efforts for CDI prevention among high-risk patients. The primary outcome will be hospital-associated CDI incidence. We will measure outcomes in patients identified as high-risk by the risk classification tool, comparing a 24- month pre-implementation period with a 12-month post-implementation period using interrupted time series (ITS) segmented regression. Secondary outcomes will include antimicrobial utilization rates, CDI test ordering, hospital length of stay, total cost, tool use, and AMS satisfaction Hypothesis: We hypothesize that tool implementation will result in a 35% relative reduction in CDI incidence, which aligns well with the lower end of estimates of bundle effect in prior studies. Significance: While evidence supports the efficacy of AMS interventions for CDI-prevention in general, our proposal is the first to our knowledge to employ a precision-medicine approach to CDI prevention. This high- impact, precision medicine proposal, based on extensive, sound preliminary data has a high probability of success. Project Narrative Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an epidemic in hospitalized patients, and current prevention strategies are limited by difficulties identifying patients most likely to benefit from interventions. We developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately estimating risk of CDI.

"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population.

"Nurse AMIE: Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday in Rural PA and WV Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with cancer who live in rural settings experience worse outcomes as compared to those in urban settings. Individuals in rural regions have difficulty accessing supportive care services due to travel challenges, cost of services, and overall lack of available supportive care resources. The latter issue likely contributes greatly to the urban/rural survival differences, given that multiple studies document that regularly addressing patient symptoms has a survival benefit in the setting of advanced cancer. Technology may provide solutions to overcome issues of rurality, however, little work has been done to specifically leverage technology- based solutions to deliver high quality supportive care in rural settings. Our team has developed and pilot tested a tablet-based symptom assessment and supportive care intervention called Nurse AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) that was well received by patients with metastatic cancer, including a subset of rural patients living in non-metropolitan counties (Rural Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) counties of 4 or higher). Patients were provided a tablet and cellular data plan to allow them to answer symptom questions daily, and an embedded personalized decision tree then offered evidence based self-care interventions to address the self-reported symptom with a goal of improving overall health and well-being. A pedometer and resistance band were also provided, given evidence that physical activity can assist with all four of the symptoms addressed in Nurse AMIE (fatigue, sleep, distress, and pain). These four symptoms form the basis of the psychoneurological symptom cluster that has been noted to be associated with quality of life and survival in oncology patients. Nurse AMIE can conduct symptom assessment, track data, and provide interventions offline if internet access is unavailable. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates acceptability and feasibility of the tablet-based approach as our patients logged on 57% of intervention days. Furthermore, patients using Nurse AMIE reported high patient satisfaction with the self-care system. Based on findings from the pilot, we propose to add a weekly survey similar to that from prior research by Basch et al. and Denis et al. to expand the symptom assessment aspect of the platform. We propose that this distance based supportive care intervention (Nurse AMIE) will have significant effects on rural patients overall survival (primary outcome), cancer treatment-related symptoms, function, and health related quality of life. We will focus our efforts on N=344 underserved or low-income adult men and women living in non-metropolitan counties (RUCC codes 4- 9) that have low access to supportive care. This work will be carried out with the help of a strong community advisory board, and guided by the PA and WV State Offices of Rural Health. We will enroll and randomize patients to receive the Nurse AMIE supportive care intervention or usual care. Enrollment will occur at regularly scheduled medical visits and the intervention will extend for the length of follow-up (2 years). We will also examine the cost effectiveness of Nurse AMIE. Nurse AMIE Project Narrative Rural patients with metastatic cancer are less likely to have access to high quality supportive care. This may have a negative effect on survival and well-being. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the survival benefits of a high quality technology based supportive care platform among 344 underserved, low income patients with metastatic cancer living in rural Pennsylvania or West Virginia.",Nurse AMIE: Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday in Rural PA and WV,10085516,R01CA254659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Cancer Patient', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distress', 'Enrollment', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Nurses', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Schedule', 'Self Care', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'West Virginia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'care systems', 'common symptom', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost estimate', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'men', 'opportunity cost', 'pedometer', 'personalized decision', 'primary outcome', 'psychosocial', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'rural setting', 'rural underserved', 'rurality', 'symptom cluster', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor', 'urban setting', 'usual care arm']",NCI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2021,656763
"Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance.

"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system.

"Advancing Maryland's Statewide Suicide Data Warehouse to Improve Individual and Population-level Mortality Prediction and Prevention ❖ PROJECT SUMMARY In 2018, NIMH funded the development of the Maryland Suicide Data Warehouse (MSDW). The aim of developing MSDW was to link a diverse set of data sources and use various layers of risk factors to predict suicide death on a generalizable population. Currently, MSDW includes data on ~5+ million Maryland residents spanning from 2012 to 2017. MSDW contains hospital and emergency discharges, health information exchange (HIE) data, commercial insurance claims, medical examiner data, electronic health record (EHR) data from 5 select health systems, and place-based social determinants of health data covering various domains such as housing, employment, education, income and crime. This study will leverage the unique data types linked by MSDW to improve suicide death predictions among generalizable patient populations. Our proposed study will further expand the underlying data and develop cutting-edge use cases of MSDW.

"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,10151599,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2021,386906
"Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI Project Summary / Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy. Project Narrative This project ultimately aims at optimizing the non-invasive monitoring of exercise therapy in heart failure patients to potentially improve outcome. The research strategy is designed to systematically develop an innovative cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that overcomes major shortcomings of the conventional methods and aims at immediate clinical translation. Successful completion of this project will result in a clinically robust cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that can effectively monitor the efficacy of exercise therapy and potentially improve treatment of heart failure.",Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI,10214689,R01HL151704,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Histology', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Pacemakers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'RNA marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Tachycardia', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'cardioprotection', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'denoising deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exercise training', 'functional loss', 'heart function', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'preservation', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'reconstruction', 'sedentary', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,673600
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10268976,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model', 'virtual patient']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2021,101117
"Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease A growing number of older patients are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to advances in life- prolonging technologies and the aging of the population. As CKD advances towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), even life-prolonging technologies cannot extend life indefinitely, especially for patients who have a poor prognosis and for whom decisions about medical interventions become particularly important. Consequently, older patients with advanced CKD need to communicate with their physicians about their preferences regarding CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care (medical management of symptoms of advanced CKD without dialysis) in order to make crucial decisions impacting the length and quality of their lives. Communication surrounding medical decision making is formalized in Advance Care Planning (ACP), a process involving verbal or written information designed to inform patients of possible medical options including CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care. Traditional ACP for patients with ESRD relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of treatment options. This approach is limited because these options are difficult to envision. We have developed a video decision aid for reviewing CPR, dialysis and non-dialytic treatment preferences in ESRD. The tool, which is available in both English and Spanish, also allows patients to video record their preferences (""video declaration"") and share their preferences with their clinicians and caregivers. The overall objective of this study is to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of the video intervention (vs. usual care) to test the hypothesis that the video better informs older persons with advanced CKD and poor prognosis of their treatment options and leads to more ACP documentation, informed decision making, and improved quality of life. We will compare ACP documentation after one year (or at time of death) among 600 patients aged 75 or older with advanced CKD and poor prognosis randomly assigned to either the video intervention or usual care (Aim 1). We will compare ESRD treatment preferences, decisional conflict, ACP engagement and conversations, and concordance of preferences stated after the video intervention or usual care with ESRD care delivery after one year (or at time of death) (Aim 2). We will explore the quality of life, longevity, and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) associated with patients' ESRD treatment decisions in the video vs. control groups (Aim 3). We will also conduct a qualitative assessment of the video declarations as well as barriers and facilitators for intervention success (Aims 4 and 5). ESRD in older patients involves complex decision making. It is imperative that we develop and evaluate early interventions to deliver more patient- focused care to this rapidly growing segment of the population. Using videos to enhance communication offers an opportunity to improve care of this vulnerable group of patients. Video is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach that has the potential to improve the quality of care provided to tens of thousands of older Americans. It is imperative to develop scalable and effective approaches to supporting persons with advanced kidney disease and their family caregivers. By providing video education tools to better inform persons making decisions about medical care and offering evidence-based options for kidney care, there is an opportunity to improve quality of life throughout the care trajectory.",Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease,10144365,R01AG066892,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Documentation', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'End stage renal failure', 'Family Caregiver', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Supportive care', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,2122297
"Place-level discrimination and birth outcomes Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability.  In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination  partially contributes to this disparity. Most of research on discrimination and birth outcomes  relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and there have been few studies examining  discrimination at the U.S. national level. Social contexts in which greater hostility towards  minorities is manifested may cause psychological stress and increase risk of adverse birth  outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to develop a new county-level indicator  of discriminatory attitudes from social media data as well as make use hate crimes data and  measures of explicit and implicit racial bias to provide a detailed and nuanced investigation of  the impact of discrimination on birth outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes.  Another strength of this research plan is the longitudinal study design with multiple years of data  for both measures of discrimination and birth outcomes, which allows us to control for temporal  trends and stable characteristics of the counties. Furthermore, the influence of discrimination on  birth outcomes may begin prior to pregnancy. There is increasing recognition of maternal health  prior to conception influencing fetal development and birth outcomes. The project will empirically  evaluate whether place-level discrimination is associated with biomarkers of chronic stress among  young women of child-bearing age. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds  on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in: 1)  developing expertise in Big Data, 2) measurement of discrimination, and 3) stress physiology and  birth outcomes. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful  independent research career evaluating how discrimination impact minority health and health  disparities. Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability.  In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination  partially contributes to this disparity.

"Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock Project Summary  Physicians in the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) make decisions in an increasingly data- and knowledge- rich world, yet often they get little help. Currently, each physician makes decisions based on his or her mental model of the patient’s physiology, together with mental predictions of the patient’s response to intervention. This approach can lead to a range of behaviors that compromise patient outcomes, including oversimplification of the physiology, errors due to cognitive overload, and physician to physician variability in decision making. A computational tool equipped with quantitative knowledge of physiology, the ability to systematically evaluate all the data, and informed by a database of past action-outcome events could aid the physician with valuable suggestions for action.  We propose to train an algorithm to make decisions about dosing vasoactive medications and initiating mechanical support in patients with cardiogenic shock due to decompensated heart failure. This focused set of decisions entails calculations about the physiology that are normally performed in a physician’s head. We frame the decision problem as optimizing cardiovascular function to preserve oxygen delivery, and we apply tools from optimal control. Rather than hand-design a CCU controller we will use reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to “fit” one. The field of RL has experienced explosive growth over the past few years, with notable advances in strategic decision problems and robotics. A key challenge in the clinical environment is that the exploration phase of learning (“trial and error”) would be unethical in real patients. A second challenge is that the availability of patient data, while growing, is likely to be a bottleneck. We will leverage state-of-the-art model-based RL to train an algorithm using a combination of simulation and off-policy learning from historical data. We will use a model of cardiovascular physiology that underlies cardiac simulators in use today for the training of cardiologists. Historical patient data will come from the Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Data Animation Center which has recorded real-time telemetry waveform data in addition to standard electronic medical record data from all CCU patients spanning several years. This is one of the largest and most complete datasets of its kind. The complexity of managing cardiogenic shock will continue to escalate as tools become more sophisticated and patients live longer, with more extensive comorbidities. Advanced decision support tools could help tame this complexity, improving the quality of care as well as democratizing it. Project Narrative The sickest cardiac patients are treated in the intensive care unit and are complex to manage. We aim to create a tool that will use artificial intelligence to study a patient's data and offer a physician advice. Our goal is to improve the patient's chance of survival and shorten their time in intensive care.",Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock,10218696,R21EB030756,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Aviation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiogenic Shock', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'animation', 'base', 'cardiac intensive care unit', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital health', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unethical']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2021,252000
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions.

"Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations PROJECT SUMMARY  Large confirmatory or pragmatic clinical trials enroll patients from multiple centers to obtain high-quality evidence useful for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. The design of multicenter trials is particularly appealing to policymakers because many tend to be pragmatic and offer access to a large sample of diverse patient populations. Decision-makers trying to use the results of multicenter trials have specific target populations in mind. Yet, selection at both the center and individual participant level challenges the ability of even well-designed and conducted multicenter trials to draw inferences about any meaningful target population. These selection mechanisms, even in impeccably conducted multicenter trials, result in samples of trial participants that are not representative of any specific target population. When treatment effects are heterogeneous over covariates that are differentially distributed across centers, the overall trial average treatment effect estimate will not apply to any one of the populations underlying the participating centers or the target population. Consider for example, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large multicenter trial of 33 centers (53,456 individuals) across the United States, which motivated this proposal. Because the positive benefits of screening are mainly concentrated in individuals at high-risk for lung cancer it is critical that individuals are appropriately targeted for screening recommendations. Our long-term objective is to optimize the applicability of trial results into clinical practice. We will take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Develop robust and efficient statistical methods, that can be combined with modern machine learning techniques, to reinterpret a multicenter trial in the context of each of the participating centers and to transport inferences from a multicenter trial to a new target population; (2) Evaluate the performance of methods developed in Aim 1 in simulation studies that reflect real-world data by considering scenarios with different sample sizes, number of centers, treatment effects, and outcome or selection mechanisms; (3) Apply the methods in the NLST to reinterpret the trial in the context of one of the participating centers and to transport trial findings to a new target population using baseline data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the United States general population. The proposed work is innovative for analyzing multicenter trials because it develops new methods, clarifies the assumptions needed for obtaining valid inference, and empirically assesses method performance. This work is significant because as a result of applying these methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials. Insights gained from this work will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. Selection bias at both the individual and center level challenge the applicability of trial findings to populations often underrepresented in trials, such as women, ethnic/racial minorities, or the elderly. This work aligns with AHRQ’s mission and priority areas because as a result of applying these proposed methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying target populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials, where decisions must be made.",Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations,10228266,R36HS028373,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2021,43083
"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources.

"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a sudden catastrophic loss of the pulse, affects >350,000 in the US annually. Most will suffer sudden cardiac death (SCD) within 10 minutes of presentation, yielding a mortality rate >90%. Based on our recent work, we have proposed a novel paradigm for SCD called “near-term prevention”. SCA is often not as sudden as one might expect. At least 50% of individuals will have warning symptoms at some time in the 4 weeks prior to SCD, but these can be non-specific, so are often not acted upon. The overall goal of this proposal is to refine the identification of the symptomatic individual at high-risk of SCD, during this 4-week window of opportunity. We propose that a simultaneous examination of symptoms, clinical factors and biomarkers may identify individuals at highest risk of imminent SCD, which could enable prediction and pre-emptive management, thereby preventing SCD. We are proposing to develop a comprehensive risk score from two population-based studies founded by the PI. The Portland, Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon-SUDS, catchment area ≈ 1 million) is now in its 17th year and the Ventura, California PRESTO study (Prediction of Sudden Death in Multi-Ethnic Communities, catchment area ≈ 850,000) is in its 5th year. The resulting combined databank contains information on >7500 SCD cases and controls, with detailed clinical phenotyping and a biobank of plasma samples. From Oregon-SUDS, we recently reported that 51% (n=430) of 839 individuals who suffered SCD presented with at least one symptom within the 4 weeks prior to their lethal event. The main symptom was chest pain, but dyspnea, fatigue, syncope and palpitations were also recorded. Warning signs could represent an opportunity for near-term prediction of SCD. While these symptoms are common and may be non-specific for SCD, we hypothesize that a combination of specific symptoms and clinical profile could facilitate the identification of patients at high risk of impending SCA. In addition, the discovery of novel plasma biomarkers for SCD could have additional utility for risk stratification. We therefore hypothesize that biomarkers, when combined with specific symptoms and clinical profile, will maximize the likelihood of identifying symptomatic subjects at highest risk of SCD, allowing for early intervention. SCD remains a major public health problem with a critical need for novel prediction and prevention. Development of this user-friendly risk score for imminent SCD in those with warning symptoms would represent a practical and clinically meaningful advance for triage of patients for optimal care. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a public health problem of substantial magnitude and at least fifty percent of affected individuals have warning signs in the four weeks preceding their event. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction score for imminent SCD in those that have warning signs, in order to improve the effectiveness of SCD prevention.",Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs,10119320,R01HL147358,"['911 call', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dyspnea', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Oregon', 'Palpitations', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'Sudden Death', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'common symptom', 'community living', 'data repository', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lipidomics', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'sudden cardiac death', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,800448
"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research.

"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,10200136,UH3HL144163,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adherence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Libraries', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Self Management', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'chatbot', 'copayment', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'four-arm study', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation process', 'improved', 'individual response', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety net', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'text messaging intervention', 'theories', 'treatment as usual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,UH3,2021,1417404
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,10136697,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,172800
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,10133145,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk prediction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,191000
"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,10020889,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'body language', 'cognitive computing', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2021,1924651
"NBER Center for Aging and Health Research OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Lessons for COVID-19 from the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 to 1920 There is currently great concern about the health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. One issue is how non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions (NPIs) impact the spread of the disease and, hence, fatality rates. A second is the inequality in infection rates and deaths across people with different socioeconomic characteristics. The goal of this project is to draw lessons for today from the Great Influenza Pandemic, which began in spring 1918, peaked during a second wave in late 1918 and early 1919, persisted through 1920, and cumulatively killed 40 million people worldwide. Using a combination of cross-city and cross-national analyses, the project will study how disease outcomes from the Great Influenza Pandemic relate to variations in population demographics and patterns of NPI use. The project will assess how disease outcomes relate to the types and durations of non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions implemented across geographic locations and over time. It will characterize the NPIs that were adopted during the Great Influenza Pandemic in terms of type, intensity, and duration of application. Among the NPIs to be considered are school closings, prohibitions of public gatherings, and quarantine/isolation. The project will analyze variations in infections, deaths, population demographics, and NPI use across at least 45 large US cities, 48 countries, and cities in Spain and England, where high-frequency data are available on flu-related excess mortality. The project will be conducted as a supplement to grant P30-AG012810, the NBER Center for Aging and Health Research. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative The Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 to 1920 is the historical case that offers the greatest opportunity for drawing lessons for the current COVID-19 pandemic.

"Novel, High-Impact Studies Evaluating Health System and Healthcare Professional Responsiveness to COVID-19 PROJECT SUMMARY FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY Background: We are experiencing an event unlike any in living history. The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world. The size, scope, and speed of this pandemic has created an imperative for rapid dissemination of data and findings. The response of US primary care practices to COVID-19 is a large-scale natural experiment of the capacity of primary care to meet the majority of people's needs. And yet, at the start the pandemic in the US, there was no one organization, federal agency, or national dataset able to provide real-time on-the-ground data regarding the experiences of primary care practices or their patients. Purpose: On March 13, 2020, as the US declared COVID-19 a national emergency, our team created a national research Collaboratory and launched the “Quick COVID-19 Primary Care Survey” (C19 Survey) to fill that gap. The Pilot C19 Survey began as a clinician-based weekly national survey to monitor the response, challenges, and capacity of US primary care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. After 4 weeks, we launched a complementary patient-based C19 Survey. People Are Primary would allow the C19 Surveys to continue beyond the Pilot stage. We will examine the responses, challenges, and capacity of primary care practices in order to evaluate the resilience and adaptive decision- making required during the pandemic. Drawing on both patients and clinicians, we will examine the rapid adoption of digital health by primary care as well as the positive and negative consequences of digital health on 1) access to care across varied settings, 2) patient and clinician care delivery experiences, and 3) the interaction of digital health with relationships between primary care patients and primary care teams. Methods: This is a mixed-methods learning evaluation with an exploratory sequential design. Regular surveys will be distributed to identified clinician and patient groups throughout the 2-year study period. These will begin weekly and will evolve into biweekly and then monthly surveys in response to changes in the natural evolution of the pandemic and subsequent primary care practice response. The research team will engage in weekly rapid learning cycles that complete data collection, analysis, dissemination, and adjustment to survey instrument within a 7-day period. The team will also use bimonthly deep learning cycles to develop time series and trend- based analysis, offering a more extended conversation of these findings and their implications for the long-term stability and strengthening of the US primary care platform. Benefit: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the costs of chronic and fragmented under-investment in primary care. Examination of the rapid adoption of digital health and its impact on patient and clinician experiences of care during the pandemic can inform a much needed strategy to 1) stop the immediate threat of primary care collapse, 2) identify practice and funding strategies able to stabilize primary care practices, and 3) enable the long term strengthening of primary care. PROJECT NARRATIVE FOR PEOPLE ARE PRIMARY The global pandemic, referred to as “COVID-19”, has become a one-of-a-kind stress test on health care systems around the world.

"IMProving Outcomes Related to Patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT) Although healthcare costs in the United States rank among the highest in the world, critical health outcomes rank lower than other high resource countries. In an effort to improve healthcare quality and concomitantly reduce costs, Congress identified certain serious and expensive but preventable hospital acquired conditions such as patient falls, pressure ulcer injuries (PUI) and hospital acquired infections (HAI), that would no longer be reimbursed by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These preventable adverse events have been linked with nursing time with patients. Nurses play a critical role in preventing adverse outcomes by quickly identifying patients at risk, evaluating the extent of these risks, and acting upon the changing status of the patient, a process termed “nurse surveillance.” Hence, nurses are key contributors to overall patient surveillance and safety. The Joint Commission recommends that the nurses give report at the patient bedside, termed “bedside shift report” (BSR), to reduce errors and improve continuity of care; hourly rounds (HR) are also recommended to reduce falls; both of these measures contribute to nurse surveillance of patients, but their relationship to patient outcomes remains understudied. NewYork-Presbyterian, a large academic health system, is piloting an innovative technology called “iN,” to improve BSR and HR through the use of color-changing lights and integrated mobile app to remind nurses when these activities have not been completed. This technology uses a combination of mounted hardware in the patient room with obfuscated computer vision to provide constant surveillance of the patient room and companion software supplied via a mobile phone app that integrates these technologies. This novel intervention to increase BSR and HR by nurses, which generates detailed process data, offers an unprecedented opportunity to gain a complete understanding of all activities that take place at the bedside and yet has not yet been studied to characterize nurse surveillance or to assess associations with related patient outcomes. The IMProving Outcomes Related to patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT) study will characterize nurse surveillance and its influence on patient falls, HAI, and PUI to generate new knowledge about factors that influence these nurse-sensitive patient outcomes. Using the dataset built in this study that will integrate data from the iN device, electronic health record, staffing and census data, and hospital reported quality measures on falls, HAI and PUIs, this prospective cohort study design will use descriptive statistics and a Cox-proportional hazard model to characterize nurse surveillance and the contribution of BSR and HR to nurse surveillance to generate predictive indicators of these nurse-sensitive outcomes (falls, PUIs HAIs), which can be used to identify intervention targets. The IMPORTANT study addresses AHRQ’s specific priorities to conduct “Research to improve health care patient safety,” and “Harness data and technology to improve healthcare quality and patient outcomes and to provide a 360-degree view of the patient” and will address AHRQ priority populations of the those with multiple chronic conditions, minorities, and women. Project Narrative This “IMProving Outcomes Related to patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT)” study will explore an innovative technology that will capture information about a technology-enabled intervention to improve nurse surveillance and subsequent nurse-sensitive patient outcomes: patient falls, pressure ulcer injury, and hospital acquired infections. This study will provide an enhanced understanding of nursing interactions with patients at the bedside and subsequent effects on related patient outcomes through the use of both existing data and novel technology.",IMProving Outcomes Related to Patients Through Advanced Nursing Technology (IMPORTANT),10131779,R03HS027006,[' '],AHRQ,HUNTER COLLEGE,R03,2021,51444
"Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences Abstract A major approach in causal inference literature aimed at mitigating bias due to unmeasured confounding is the so- called instrumental variable (IV) design which relies on identifying a variable which (i) influences the treatment process, (ii) has no direct effect on the outcome other than through the treatment, and (iii) is independent of any unmeasured confounder. IV methods are very well developed and widely used in social and health science, although validity of IV inferences may not be reliable if any of required assumptions (i)-(iii) is violated. This proposal aims to develop (a) new IV methods robust to violation of any of (i)-(iii); (b) New negative control methods that can be used to detect and sometimes to nonparametrically account for unmeasured confounding bias; (c) New bracketing methods for partial inference about causal effects in comparative interrupted time series studies. The proposed methods will be used to address current scientific queries in three major substantive public health areas:(1) to understand the health effects of air pollution; (2) to quantify the causal effects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; (3) To uncover the mechanism by which a randomized package of interventions produced a substantial reduction of HIV incidence in a recent major cluster randomized trial of treatment as prevention in Botswana, Africa. Our proposal will provide the best available analytical methods to date to resolve confounding concerns in these high impact public health applications and more broadly in observational studies in the health sciences. Summary This proposal aims to develop new causal inference methods to tame bias due to hidden confounding factors in obser- vational studies as well as in randomized experiments subject to non-adherence. The proposed methods are firmly grounded in modern semiparametric theory which will be used to obtain more robust and efficient inferences about causal effects in a broad range of public health applications including in Epidemiology of Aging, Environmental Health Epidemiology and HIV/AIDS Prevention.",Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences,10159821,R01AG065276,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Africa', 'Aging', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Botswana', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Genetic', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Randomized', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Time', 'ambient air pollution', 'analytical method', 'c new', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'intervention effect', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment as prevention', 'treatment effect', 'uptake', 'user friendly software']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,468961
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,10176417,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,407634
"Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data SUMMARY Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and is largely considered preventable by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Lipid-lowering therapy is the current mainstay of preventative treatment for ASCVD and guidelines for pharmacotherapy rely on the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) for estimating 10-year risk. While these equations have been validated at a population level they have significant shortcomings that impact real-world patient-level effectiveness. These include implementation (i.e. time and effort for clinicians to enter patient data into a phone or web-based calculator), therapy changing sensitivity to highly variable inputs (e.g single time point blood pressure), paradoxical risk estimation for some patient subgroups that are an artifact of linear modeling (e.g. women smokers), blunt treatment of race (i.e. separately derived equations for black patients), and poor calibration for modern cohorts (i.e. resulting in the overestimation of risk). This project will attempt to address these shortcomings. First, portable tools for analyzing electronic health records found within the Rhode Island Health Information Exchange (HIE) will be developed for the extraction of PCE risk factors to enable the automated calculation of ASCVD risk. PCE risk factor extraction permutations (e.g. last vs mean blood pressure) will be optimized and the equations will be calibrated for the population. Next, EHR-system agnostic tools for extracting additional risk factors available within the medical record including symptom development, social determinants of health, and family history will be developed. PCE and non-PCE risk factors will be used for artificial neural network and dynamic Bayesian network modeling of ASCVD risk phenotype clusters to augment PCE risk prediction. Finally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data derived ASCVD genetic risk score will be integrated with the HIE derived risk factors to demonstrate the potential clinical implications of implementing an omics-integrated learning healthcare system. The project will serve as foundational training for the principal investigator towards pursuing a career as a physician-scientist in the field of biomedical informatics. Hypothesis: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation is central to current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. This project will test the hypothesis that population-level data-driven methods will improve the accuracy of risk calculators.

"High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart Project Summary Ischemic preconditioning is a well-established phenomenon, in which a brief episode(s) of controlled ischemia and reperfusion renders cardioprotection from a subsequent sustained episode of ischemia. An emerging body of evidence demonstrated that neural regulated heart rate modulation confers cardiac preconditioning responses. Understanding the mechanism through model systems of preconditioning would help us identify the genes and proteins when designing future drug targets for the prevention of ischemic cardiac injury. As a promising alternative to electrical pacing to modulate heart rate, optogenetic pacing does not require physical contact, has high spatial and temporal precision, offers more specific excitation, and avoids artifacts from electrical stimulation. Recent developments in the field of optogenetics make it possible for non-invasive and specific optical control of the heart rhythm in animal models, such as in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is a powerful genetic model system that has been used since the early 1900s to characterize genes associated with human diseases, including cardiac diseases. Studies performed in flies can provide insights into conserved mechanisms in cardiac diseases, which can be applied to higher organisms, including humans. Working in collaboration with Drs. Airong Li and Rudolph Tanzi from the Massachusetts General Hospital, we demonstrated non-invasive optogenetic pacing and concurrent optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the Drosophila heart for the first time. Recently, we further demonstrated red-light optogenetic pacing and successful optical control of tachycardia, bradycardia, and restorable cardiac arrest in fly models. Building on the decade-long productive collaboration with Drs. Li and Tanzi and new collaborations with Dr. Abhinav Diwan (cardiologist) and Dr. Jeanne Nerbonne (cardiac electrophysiologist) and Dr. Kenneth Schechtman (biostatistician) at Washington University, we propose to develop a high-throughput integrated OCT imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing system and establish a novel research platform to study preconditioning and hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart. We hypothesize that periods of bradypacing will precondition the fly heart to protect against hypoxia, via activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The specific aims are: 1) Develop and optimize a high-throughput integrated instrument for non-invasive OCT imaging and optogenetic control of fly heart function in vivo; 2) Develop double transgenic fly models and functional assays based on OCT imaging to characterize fly heart physiology in vivo; 3) Define functional and molecular changes in response to hypoxia and optogenetic preconditioning in transgenic fly models. If successful, the high-throughput optical imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing platform developed in this program combined with powerful double transgenic fly models will enable us to characterize changes of the fly heart function in response to different stress challenges that is not feasible before. This will allow us to perform a series of new experiments, providing insights into conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced cardiac changes and preconditioning. Project Narrative We will develop a novel research platform to noninvasively image and control heart function in fly models. Tachycardia, bradycardia and cardiac arrest will be stimulated using light and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning will be explored. The new knowledge and novel insights gleaned from these studies will advance our understanding of conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced changes in the heart and ischemic preconditioning.",High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart,10132500,R01HL156265,"['Abdomen', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Function Study', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glean', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intelligence', 'Ion Channel', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Preconditioning', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Lysosomes', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Opsin', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Side', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'cardioprotection', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart rhythm', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'instrument', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'preconditioning', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,529434
"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,10093123,R01HL144157,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Data', 'Disease model', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'NADH', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'heart cell', 'heart metabolism', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanocarrier', 'optogenetics', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'voltage']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,621465
"Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract Shear Stress and Light-Field to Elucidate the Initiation of Cardiac Outflow Tract Biomechanical forces modulate cardiac morphogenesis, and mutations in mechano-sensitive signaling pathways result in congenital heart defects. During the previous funding cycle, our team custom-built a Light- Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) with sub-voxel resolution to enhance axial resolution needed to provide a large field-of-view. This laser optical system allowed for imaging pulsatile vs. oscillatory shear stress- mediated Notch signaling to initiate endocardial trabeculation. We demonstrated that spatial (/x) and temporal (/t) variations in shear stress modulates Notch-EphrinB2-Neureguilin-1 signaling in the endocardium to activate erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase (ErbB2) that promotes proliferation of trabeculation. By integrating LSFM, computation, and transgenic models, we further established that trabeculation dissipates intracardiac shear stress-generated kinetic energy; thus, mitigating ventricular remodeling. However, it remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced myocardial contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis. Thus, we seek to integrate light-sheet (Bessel-Gaussian beam arrays) with a new 2) light-field (microlens array). The former provides non-diffracting illumination, and the latter provides volumetric detection as a paradigm shift to image both myocardial contractility and intracardiac flow dynamics in the outflow tract (OFT). Our preliminary study reveals that shear-mediated Notch1b expression in the endocardium of OFT regulates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT); however, the mechanotransduction causation whereby myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress reciprocally interact to form bicuspid valves and subsequent remodeling to multi-cuspid valves remains elusive. Thus, our hypothesis is that integration of the new light-field system with imaging computation enhances spatiotemporal resolution needed to decouple myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow dynamics that modulates Notch1b-EndoMT to mediate valve morphogenesis in the OFT. In Aim 1, we plan to integrate light-sheet with the new light-field system for 4-D volumetric imaging of valve formation in the OFT. Our goal is to capture myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress at one snapshot. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the interaction between intracardiac shear stress and myocardial contractility underlying valve morphogenesis. Our goal is to decouple hemodynamic shear from contractile forces that mediate Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. In Aim 3, we will determine the relative role of shear stress and contractility underlying Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. Our goal is to elucidate the relative role of contractility and intracardiac stress to transmit Notch1b- EndoMT signaling underlying bicuspid-valve formation. Overall, our team aims to establish the micro- environment in which intracardiac flow dynamics and myocardial contractility interact to modulate OFT valve formation, with clinical significance to aortic valvular disease. Project Narrative Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects, including aortic valves and the greater arteries, are estimated to cause approximately 30% of these congenital heart diseases, and they are treated with surgical correction and/or replacement. It remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced cardiac contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis, including aortic stenosis, bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valves. To understand the mechanotransduction causation downstream of blood flow and shear stress sensing, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to integrate advanced laser optics, imaging computation, and genetic models to decouple intracardiac flow dynamics from myocardial contractility that modulates Notch1b-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) with translational implication to aortic valve disease.",Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract,10146767,R01HL129727,"['4D Imaging', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Arteries', 'Bicuspid', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Computer Models', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Coupled', 'Cuspid', 'Custom', 'Data Reporting', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Endocardium', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Microscopy', 'Mitral Valve', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Contraction', 'Neuregulin 1', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'erbB-2 Receptor', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'mechanotransduction', 'multidisciplinary', 'notch protein', 'optical imaging', 'response', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,459651
"Personalized 3D avatar tool development for measurement of body perception across gender identities Abstract Public awareness of the diversity of experiences of gender identities has climbed sharply. The specific issues of those with gender dysphoria (GD) related to self-identity, body image, and medical interventions are challenges for the 21st century, particularly given the high risk of suicide. Gender identity is tightly linked to one’s bodily features, particularly readily observable sexual characteristics. For transgender and nonbinary individuals with GD, the incongruence between their body associated with their birth-assigned sex – what they see in the mirror before any treatment – and the internalized representation of their gender-identified body is a key defining part of their experience and contributes to their dysphoria. Currently, no clinical or research tool exists to capture and quantify the diverse experiences of one’s current body and one’s gender-identified body (which may be distinct from their current body), across a range of gender identities. Measuring the internalized representation of one’s body could be facilitated by technology to visually represent this on a three-dimensional avatar. The technology needed to scan and analyze the human figure is now available and cost efficient. It is now possible to scan individuals to create personalized 3D visualizations, or “avatars,” with which they can interact on mobile and desktop devices to represent internal representation of their bodies. This can allow individuals to see and manipulate their own 3D avatar with a high degree of flexibility. The goal of this project is to create a novel, visually based digital tool to measure, understand, and quantify individuals’ experiences of their bodies. We will develop, validate, and test in transgender, nonbinary, and cisgender adults a personalized avatar tool to represent internalized gender-identified bodies in order to quantify incongruence between this and one’s current body. This tool – “GD Somatomap” – will be an advancement over existing self-report questionnaires to capture visual representations of internalized body image, cross-sectionally and dynamically over time. It will be flexible enough to characterize the heterogenous experiences of a range of gender identities including binary transgender, gender fluid, nonbinary, and cisgender. It can be used in clinical and clinical research applications to track outcomes of cross-hormone and gender-affirming surgical treatments. It can potentially improve clinical outcomes by identifying specific sets of body parts as targets for treatments to improve body congruence. Further, it will provide a unique means to measure own-body perceptual accuracy; understanding differences in perceptual accuracy and what potentially modifiable factors contribute to this may have prognostic significance for treatments to address body incongruence. It could also be used in future studies to investigate functional and structural neurobiological correlates of body perception and internal body representation, and at what point in neurodevelopment these emerge for those with different gender identities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The internalized, conscious experience of one’s body is not easily communicated, much less measured and quantified. This is especially relevant for those with gender dysphoria, whose internal, gender-identified body representation is incongruent with their current body. We will develop and test an innovative technological solution, making use of 3D image reconstruction and advanced 3D modeling, to create personalized avatars to measure body incongruence for research and clinical applications in those with gender dysphoria.",Personalized 3D avatar tool development for measurement of body perception across gender identities,10111313,R21EB030851,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Body Image', 'Body measure procedure', 'Body part', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Distress', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gender Identity', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Grouping', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical shape', 'Problem Solving', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'base', 'body dissatisfaction', 'cisgender', 'clinical application', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dysphoria', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'gender dysphoria', 'gender fluid', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'sex', 'suicidal risk', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transgender', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,203647
"Conception Failure and Pregnancy Loss in the U.S. NEW EVIDENCE ON CONCEPTION AND PREGNANCY LOSS IN THE U.S. ABSTRACT Conception failure and pregnancy loss impede the pathway to parenthood for millions of US couples each year. Despite being modifiable and common—pregnancy loss occurs fifty times as often as infant mortality— miscarriage is among the least well-studied aspects of population health or population dynamics. We know little about what causes these losses, the generalizability of estimates generated from the study of small recruited samples, including how the risk of miscarriage differs across time, place, or subpopulation.  These enormous gaps are driven by how difficult it is to study the pathway to live birth in humans, requiring a sufficiently large and diverse “preconception cohort.” To date small, nonrepresentative cohorts contribute most of what we know about early pregnancy. But limited sample size, variation, and coverage preclude the study of social and ecological factors—poverty, partner health, environmental exposures—that are now widely understood to shape mortality at later ages: e.g., stillbirth, infant, and child mortality. Such omissions are consequential. Conception failures and pregnancy loss have significant emotional and economic costs. Though pregnancy failures are likely distributed unevenly across populations, the size of this disparate burden is unknown. We do not have evidence about the potential impact of policies on the prevention of these outcomes.  Our research combines the tools of data science and social science to scale the preconception design to a large, diverse cohort in the US. Period and pregnancy “tracking” on digital devices is now common among reproductive-age women. We use data on 4 million women’s day-to-day recording of menstrual cycles, ovulation, and pregnancy, as well as reported social and economic characteristics. The data allow us to measure both reported and detected conception and pregnancy loss. We combine the data with georeferenced information about the physical, social, economic, and policy environments in which women and their partners live. The sample is diverse: users come from over 99% of U.S. counties; over 1 million users are on Medicaid. We use these extraordinary data to provide the first estimates of large-scale population variability in the pathway to live birth and to document factors that affect this pathway. Aim 1 develops new estimates of conception and pregnancy loss, including disparities associated with education, income, racial identification, and neighborhood poverty. Aim 2 estimates the contribution of male partner characteristics to conception and pregnancy loss, drawing on detailed data reported about partners. Aim 3 uses quasi-experimental designs to provide the first estimates of understudied exposures from multiple environmental, social, economic domains on conception and pregnancy loss. The research sheds new light on a pervasive and massively understudied public health concern, with direct implications for the improvement of early pregnancy outcomes. In so doing, the research also generates estimates that are much-needed inputs to support advancement in multiple, connected fields of study in the social, health, and biomedical sciences. NARRATIVE Conception failure and miscarriage affect millions of U.S. couples each year.

"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,10132378,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'provider behavior', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,143581
"Developing Suicide Risk Algorithms for Diverse Clinical Settings using Data Fusion Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Recent evidence indicates that many if not most of individuals who die by suicide have been in contact with the healthcare system in the months prior to their death, providing data that can be used to identify patients at risk prior to an attempt. The proposed project will develop an innovative method for identifying patients at risk of suicidal behavior using data from a large multistate health information exchange, integrated with data from the State of Connecticut’s CHIME hospital database. We will develop and test suicide risk algorithms using principles associated with transfer learning, in which information from a comprehensive external data source is used to improve prediction in a more limited dataset. Specifically, we will use multimodal data fusion techniques to develop and test algorithms that can identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior by clinicians in hospitals with limited numbers of patients, select patient populations, and lack of access to outpatient data. This approach is not only generalizable to hospitals throughout the US but can be extended to very diverse clinical settings, e.g., primary and specialty care practices, community health centers, urgent care clinics. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial.

"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,10150094,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'military veteran', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,554790
"Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly, symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR, and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis ultimately leads to heart failure and death, but valve replacement is curative. For many patients, valve replacement is performed too late, after damage to the heart muscle is no longer reversible, resulting in persistent symptoms and increased risk for death. The goal of my research is to identify compounds within the blood that can serve as an early warning that the heart is struggling to overcome aortic stenosis and can therefore help physicians plan the optimal timing of valve replacement surgery.",Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart,10127697,R01HL151838,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'EFRAC', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heart', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'aortic valve replacement', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'patient registry', 'persistent symptom', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive signature', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,665495
"(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI Abstract Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the US has increased by 38% over the last eight years, with drugs as a major contributor to AKI in hospitalized patients. Drug-associated AKI (D-AKI) results in severe consequences with approximately 40% of patients experiencing in-hospital death or dialysis dependence and 70% having evidence of residual kidney damage following the initial D-AKI event. We have determined that many patients at high risk for AKI are identified late and often continue to receive nephrotoxic drugs until AKI becomes severe. Thus, we designed a proposal to address the need for early, appropriate management of nephrotoxins in high-risk patients by studying the effect of an advanced clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary physicians and hospitalists aimed at reducing D-AKI in hospitalized adults. Specifically, we aim to 1) optimize the clinical performance of D-AKI risk-alerts generated by a clinical decision support system; 2) test whether an advanced clinical decision support system coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention improves short and long- term outcomes for patients with D-AKI; and 3) determine physician perception of the pharmacists’ performance, physician acceptance and cost-effectiveness of our intervention. In 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published the first comprehensive AKI clinical practice guideline. Recommendations include the use of standard criteria for defining and staging AKI and a series of stage-based management steps to be considered for all patients with AKI or at risk for developing it. However, clinicians have been slow to adopt these recommendations and some groups (most notably the US KDOQI expert panel), while endorsing the guideline overall, have called for more research testing the recommendations. Our proposal directly addresses this concern by testing whether a unique clinical decision support system identifying high risk patients coupled with an advanced pharmacist service directed to the primary physician can address D-AKI and drug dosing for other forms of AKI to improve patient care. Thus, our central goal is to examine the effect of a pharmacist-led intervention on the early detection and management of AKI, progression of and short-term recovery from AKI, and on various AKI-related outcomes. Project Narrative Patients at high risk for acute kidney injury are often identified late and often do not receive recommended diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, with drugs being the most common cause; yet are potentially preventable. Clinical decision support to physicians in the form of automated alerts and pharmacist guidance for high-risk patients with drug-associated acute kidney injury (D-AKI) could dramatically improve risk assessment, medication use, and drug dosing in even non-drug-associated acute kidney injury. In this randomized control trial application, we will test whether adult hospitalized patients with D-AKI, cared for by physicians randomized to receive clinical decision support with an advanced pharmacist-led intervention, will have a lower risk for dialysis and premature death.",(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI,10209005,R01DK121730,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Drug Modelings', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Hospitalists', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'aging population', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detection platform', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'equipment training', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'high risk', 'imaging agent', 'implementation cost', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'nephrotoxicity', 'non-drug', 'post intervention', 'premature', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,562198
"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,10147069,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,561582
"Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning Abstract: Our main clinical objective for this project is to provide personalized precision care to patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities by significantly improving the surgical planning method. CMF deformities involve congenital and acquired deformities of the jaws and face. A large number of patients in the US and around the world suffer from CMF deformities. The basic principles of CMF surgery involve the restoration of deformed CMF structures back to normal anatomy and functions with osteotomy, autologous, bone grafts, or vascularized free flaps. The success of CMF surgery depends on not only the technical aspects of the operation, but also, to a large extent, the precise formulation of a surgical plan. However, CMF surgical planning is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of CMF anatomy and deformity. During a routine CMF surgical planning, a surgeon first acquires a three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull. He then performs 3D cephalometric analysis to quantify the deformity. Finally, the surgery is simulated by virtually cutting the 3D model into multiple bony segments. The surgeon then tries his best to move and rotate each segment individually to a desired position within the normal range of cephalometric values (the current standard of care). This is problematic as “normal” cephalometric values are the averageness of normal population, in which each value has a mean and a standard deviation. Due to the variation within the normal values, the surgeon must often guess what the exact value the patient's cephalometric measurement should be corrected to. In addition, cephalometry is a group of only linear and angular measurements, which certainly cannot represent the complex nature of human CMF structures. Therefore, surgical outcomes are often subjective and heavily dependent on the surgeons' experience and artistic talent. Because each human face is different, the average “normal values” cannot represent the complex morphology of each individual face. To this end, we hypothesize that if a surgeon can foresee what the normal CMF shape of the patient should be, the surgical plan will be objective and personalized. Therefore, in this project, we propose developing and validating a new surgical planning method of using patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models. The feasibility of our approach has already been proven by our preliminary studies. The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively. The results will be especially beneficial to patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic craniofacial deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer. In the future, our approach can also be used to design and print 3D patient-specific resorbable bone implants with tissue engineering capability for bone regeneration. Project Narrative:  The current standard of care of making treatment plan for patients with craniomaxillofacial (CMF)  deformities is cephalometric analysis, including a group of linear and angular measurements, which  cannot represent the complex morphology of human CMF facial structures.  We propose to develop and validate an innovative shape-based surgical planning method of using  patient-specific and anatomically-correct reference models, for replacing the current subjective  cephalometric method.  The results of this project will significantly improve the quality of patient care by developing  personalized and precise surgical plans for CMF surgery objectively, which is especially beneficial  to the patients with jaw deformities, syndromic and non-syndromic deformities, trauma, and CMF cancer.",Learning-Based Approach for Personalized Craniomaxillofacial Surgical Planning,10197880,R01DE027251,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Autologous', 'Back', 'Bilateral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Cephalometry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Head', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Normal Range', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthodontics', 'Osteotomy', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'craniofacial', 'craniomaxillofacial', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'operation', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'psychologic', 'restoration', 'skull base', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality simulator', 'virtual surgery']",NIDCR,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,574725
"12/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.

"Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing ABSTRACT No real-time quantitative devices are clinically used to assess oral lesions during routine examination, making in-clinic diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring challenging. Instead, lesions are evaluated through visual inspection and then histopathological analysis of tissue samples extracted during biopsy. Identifying premalignant and malignant oral lesions early is critical to ensuring effective treatment is provided to patients with malignancies. Oral cancer currently has one of the lowest 5-year survival rates (50% or less) among major cancer types, largely due to the challenges in identifying premalignant and malignant lesions early. Clearly, a real-time in-clinic device able to classify oral lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant has the potential to provide immediate impact to patient care. Significantly different electrical property signatures have been observed between benign and malignant tissues in a variety of organs, including tongue; since the bioelectrical properties are so dependent on tissue architecture and morphology, we hypothesize that sensing and imaging these properties in the context of oral lesions will enable us to accurately characterize and classify morphologically-different benign, premalignant, and malignant oral lesions. We have developed an endoscopic electrical impedance imaging (EII) device for use in intraoperative surgical margin assessment that we aim to optimize for in-clinic oral lesion assessment. We aim to take the significant step of translating our extensive experience in impedance imaging to develop an oral lesion imaging device that can be deployed safely, and in the clinic, to provide real-time feedback regarding oral lesion classification. We propose constructing a novel chip-on-tip EII probe to sense and image at near microscopic resolution oral lesions in an effort to provide clinicians with real-time, accurate classification of oral lesion pathology that can be used for diagnostic and longitudinal monitoring purposes. The probe will be evaluated on a series of in vivo human oral lesions and compared with histopathological analysis of biopsy samples. The low-cost of a device such as this makes it an ideal technology for low-resource settings and the safety and real-time capabilities of the system make it ideal for continuously following lesions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Visual inspection of oral lesions is not sufficient for accurately classifying lesions as benign, premalignant, or malignant. The electrical properties of oral lesion have the potential to be used as a contrast mechanism to accurately classify oral lesions so that optimal treatment can be provided to patients with malignant lesions. We intend to deploy a novel small field of view chip-on-tip electrical impedance imaging (EII) probe in a cohort of patients with oral lesions to evaluate the efficacy of using EII for oral lesion classification.",Classifying Oral Lesions with Chip-on-tip Electrical Impedance Sensing,10287597,R21DE031095,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancerous', 'Carcinoma', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Contralateral', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysplasia', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Hand', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oral Characters', 'Oral cavity', 'Organ', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Squamous Cell', 'Surgical margins', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'analog', 'base', 'bioelectricity', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'electric impedance', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'imaging probe', 'imaging properties', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'oral lesion', 'oral tissue', 'premalignant', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'programs', 'response', 'soft tissue']",NIDCR,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,191061

"11/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Project Summary Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234).

Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,10126893,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical center', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable sensor technology']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2021,7216297
"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients. In addition, the SCS has extensive research infrastructure, which will continue to support her work. Dr. Feldman has access to Medicaid data under Dr. Costenbader’s Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and to Partners HealthCare electronic health records linked to claims data through the explicit support of Population Health Management. For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk. This study will inform the design of interventions aimed at optimizing outpatient care, preventing adverse outcomes, and reducing disparities among patients with complex, subspecialty-managed diseases.",Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus,10137787,K23AR071500,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delphi Technique', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Financial Support', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lupus', 'Mediating', 'Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Social support', 'Structural Models', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'instructor', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medical schools', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social epidemiology', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'therapy design']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,178195
"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden. This pilot is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self-management among adolescents with persistent asthma. Knowledge gained from this pilot study will be used to design and conduct a future efficacy trial of the app. This project addresses the mission of NHLBI by developing a novel intervention to treat asthma. This study leverages our formative and pilot work to continue making strides towards enhancing asthma control among adolescents with persistent asthma in order to reduce asthma-related morbidity.",Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents,10224318,R34HL145442,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Information System', 'Hispanics', 'Incentives', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Social Change', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age group', 'aged', 'arm', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient-clinician communication', 'peak flow measurement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R34,2021,256469
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,10149900,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'esophageal cancer patient', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2021,391243
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,10093121,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -

"Personalized Dietary Management in Type 2 Diabetes Abstract Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with a variety of vascular complications of the disease, but clinical trials of medication regimens designed to achieve near-normal HbA1c have been disappointing and may even increase the risk of adverse outcomes due to polypharmacy. Enhancing behavioral management of postprandial glycemia can further reduce glycemic exposure and downstream effects without the risks of polypharmacy. Postprandial glycemia is largely driven by dietary intake, but research findings regarding the best dietary approach to limit glycemic exposure are mixed and mostly negative. Studies done, to-date, have used one-size-fits-all dietary regimens that do not take into consideration the fact that glycemic response is highly individual. In this clinical trial of 255 (85/group) individuals with early-stage T2D, participants will be randomized to: (1) a Social Cognitive Theory-based behavioral lifestyle intervention that includes a one-size-fits-all Mediterranean ADA diet (hereafter Standardized), (2) Standardized plus personalized dietary guidance to minimize postprandial glycemic response to meals (hereafter Personalized), or (3) a Usual Care Control plus (hereafter UCC). We will compare the groups in terms of mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE). Hypothesis MAGEPersonalized< MAGEStandardized < MAGEUCC at 6 months. At each time point we will describe between group differences in HbA1c, β-cell function, and the need to escalate the medication regimen. We also will describe the impact of the interventions on alternative measures of glycemic variability (standard deviation, Continuous Overall Net Glycemic Action, area under the curve, and frequency of out-of-range and seriously out- of-range glucose values). We will explore the relative contribution of GV and HbA1c to observed changes in β- cell function. The proposed study is an integrative scientific undertaking, reflecting the input of experts in nursing, the behavioral sciences, computational biology, microbiome, mHealth technology, endocrinology, and nutrition for the development of personalized behavioral counseling to minimize glycemic exposure and disease progression in those with early-stage T2D. Project Narrative Limiting blood sugar peaks following meals is an important treatment goal in the management of type 2 diabetes, but evidence is mixed regarding the best dietary approach to achieve this goal. One-size-fits-all dietary recommendations may fail to limit blood sugar peaks because individuals differ greatly in their blood sugar responses to the very same foods. In this study we will compare two Mediterranean-type diabetic diets, one that has been standardized and one that has been personalized using a gut microbiome-based algorithm to limit blood sugar peaks following meals.",Personalized Dietary Management in Type 2 Diabetes,10119622,R01NR018916,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Beta Cell', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Counseling', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diabetic Diet', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Education', 'Endocrinology', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polypharmacy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'design', 'dietary', 'dietary approach', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication compliance', 'microbiome', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social cognitive theory', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NINR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,743162
"Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC) SUMMARY: In 2018, nearly 34,000 adults in the US and over 275,000 worldwide were diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC). In the US alone >6,600 died from the disease in 2018. In addition to stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, depth of invasion, and close or frankly positive resection margins are used to help stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high risk categories. Currently, all OC-SCC patients are treated primarily by surgical resection. Post-operative treatment depends on patient risk category. Low-risk patients receive surgery alone and studies have shown the benefit of PORT (Post-operative radiation therapy) in selected patients. A retrospective analysis of 1467 patients with low-risk OC-SCC where 740 (50.4%) received PORT had improved overall survival compared to 727 patients treated with surgery alone. Identifying these patients and better stratifying their risk of progression is critical. Meanwhile, patients with loco-regionally advanced (i.e. intermediate and high risk) disease are treated with PORT as standard. Select high risk patients may be treated with concomitant chemoradiation or subsequent chemotherapy. There is thus an urgent need to develop companion diagnostic tools to better define which patients will benefit from PORT, or, if intermediate or high risk, who will benefit from systemic therapy intensification.  Recently, our group has developed a OC-SCC histomorphometric based image risk classifier (OHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to identify patients who are likely to recur versus those who are not. OHbIC was trained and validated on N=115 OC-SCC patients, and it had a 2 and 7-fold higher-correlation with disease specific survival compared to the 7th edition AJCC N- and T-stage (clinical variables used in patient prognosis). In this NIH R01, we seek to further improve the prognostic and predictive accuracy of OHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, pattern of invasion at the tumor leading edge, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as potential histopathological markers of prognostic relevance in OC-SCC. Additionally, we seek to 1) validate OHbIC as prognostic of survival in clinically defined low-risk patients and identify those low-risk patients who would benefit from PORT and 2) validate OHbIC as not only prognostic of survival but also predictive of benefit from chemotherapeutic intensification for patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) digital pathomics from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in oral cancer from Vanderbilt University, Cleveland Clinic, San Francisco VA, and Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai to establish OHbIC as a tissue non-destructive and Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for OC-SCC patients. Project Relevance: In this project, we seek to improve the predictive accuracy of a computerized histomorphometric predictor (OHbIC) for risk stratification, outcome prediction and added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC) from routine H&E tissue slide images. The success of this project will pave the way for its adoption as a tissue non-destructive Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of OC-SCC patients for whom therapies could be either left as standard, or require “escalation”, depending on the OHbIC risk score.",Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC),10075748,R01CA249992,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Head and neck structure', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'India', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Platinum', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'collaborative trial', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymphatic Invasion', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'men', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'perineural', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive test', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prognostic of survival', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,697902
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic incidences known to increase cardiovascular risk as well as secondary complications.",Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes,10250801,R43DK126521,"['Adult', 'Affinity', 'Amputation', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Calorimetry', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'IGF1 gene', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leucine', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neuropathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rapid screening', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Somatomedins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Trees', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Valine', 'Xylose', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'carbene', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical candidate', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diabetic', 'drug candidate', 'euglycemia', 'global health', 'glycemic control', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'insulin Wakayama', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milligram', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'phase 2 study', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'standard of care', 'success', 'type I diabetic', 'vigilance', 'web server']",NIDDK,"AMIDEBIO, LLC",R43,2021,183955
"UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY The Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) and its observational follow up Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications (EDIC) represent landmark achievements in diabetes research. The DCCT enrolled 1441 men and women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a randomized trial of intensive vs. conventional insulin therapy, delaying the onset and progression of diabetic complications and dramatically changing the management of patients worldwide. Implementation of tight glycemic control has reduced the frequency of devastating complications of T1D such as early death, blindness and amputation. Women and men with T1D face new challenges including cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction and urological disorders. UroEDIC, an ancillary study examining urological complications in the DCCT/EDIC cohort, combines over 25 years of detailed medical information and >90% participation in urological symptom assessment annually since 2010, making it the longest running most extensive urological evaluation of persons with T1D. The previous funding cycle identified lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and urinary incontinence (UI) as urological disorders in men and women with T1D with the highest prevalence and greatest impact on quality of life (QOL). By linking powerful longitudinal urological phenotypes with extensive clinical and laboratory data of the DCCT/EDIC, we can substantially deepen our understanding of diabetes associated urinary complications. Preliminary analyses show that although many patients develop a fixed state of LUTS or UI, many others move in and out of the state over time. Our overall hypothesis is that metabolic, autonomic and epithelial dysfunctions are associated with persistent and reversible subphenotypes of LUTS and UI in men and women with diabetes. Observations also indicate bladder overactivity in both genders is increasing in this cohort. However, there is a lack of understanding of the burden and impact of other diabetic bladder problems, particularly diabetic cystopathy, classically described as decreased bladder sensation, poor contractility and high residual urine volume. The goals of UroEDIC Bladder, therefore, are to 1) characterize the full spectrum of bladder dysfunction in T1D, 2) create risk models that explain the progression and remission of LUTS/UI, and 3) identify mechanistic themes underpinning the persistence of these symptoms. The specific aims of this project are designed to incorporate newly proposed and available longitudinal data on bladder retention, autonomic dysfunction and novel transcriptional signatures with the full range of DCCT/EDIC measurements to gain deeper insight into the longitudinal patterns and mechanisms of LUTS/UI and comprehensively characterize diabetic bladder dysfunction in T1D. PROJECT NARRATIVE To advance our understanding of bladder dysfunction in type 1 diabetes (T1D), this project links existing information on diabetes severity from a large NIH study to new assessments of urinary symptoms and bladder dysfunction and urine specimens for gene expression analyses. This work will contribute comprehensive critical data to expand our knowledge about the natural history and molecular mechanisms of bladder dysfunction in T1D.",UroEDIC Bladder: Bladder Dysfunction in Type 1 Diabetes,10205344,R01DK116723,"['Achievement', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Amputation', 'Ancillary Study', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Dysfunction', 'Blindness', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Overactive Bladder', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Urothelium', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autonomic neuropathy', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes control', 'diabetic', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'incontinence symptom', 'insight', 'lower urinary tract symptoms', 'mechanotransduction', 'member', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,722963
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830
"Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  There are approximately 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. today. Childhood cancer survivors are vulnerable to late effects of therapy including chronic health conditions and premature death. Predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects, discussing how to manage these risks, and offering early preventions and interventions are critical components of survivorship care. Over 75% of childhood cancer survivors have prevalent symptoms, and constantly poor or worsening symptoms are associated with onset of medical late effects. However, regular symptom monitoring is uncommon in survivorship or primary care. The core concept of this R01 grant proposal is to enable regular monitoring of patient-generated health data (PGHD), including symptoms, physical activity, energy expenditure, sleep behavior and heart rate variability, and utilize these data in predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects to improve survivorship care and outcomes.  The proposed application will enroll 620 adult survivors of childhood cancer from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study who are ≥5 years post diagnosis and currently ≥18 years of age at enrollment to achieve the following 3 specific aims: Aim 1) use a mobile health platform to collect dynamic PGHD data over 3 months and use them to develop and validate risk prediction models for future quality-of-life (QOL); Aim 2) develop/validate risk prediction models and establish personalized risk prediction scores for other outcomes (unplanned care utilization, physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) using the same approach as Aim 1; and Aim 3) create a web-based tool to calculate and report personalized outcome-specific risks, and facilitate integration of risk scores into the survivor’s patient portal and hospital’s Electronic Health Record (EHR).  We have a series of preliminary data to support this R01 grant proposal: a) in a pilot study assessing 20 common symptoms with a mobile health platform, childhood cancer survivors completed 90% of all required evaluations over 3 months; and b) in a prediction analysis from ongoing cohort of childhood cancer survivors, the inclusion of longitudinal symptom data generated a superior model performance in predicting future QOL (prediction measure, AUC=0.85) compared to the use of only age, sex, and childhood cancer type (AUC=0.63).  Linking through a mobile health platform, we will use a smartphone to collect symptom data, a wrist-worn accelerometer to collect momentary activity/behavioral data, and a finger sensor to collect heart rate variability data. We will predict patient-reported outcomes (poor QOL, unplanned healthcare utilization) and clinically- assessed outcomes (physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) on the 12th and 24th months after collecting risk factors. We will apply state-of-the-art machine/statistical learning techniques to capture features of dynamic changes in PGHD to predict these outcomes. We will build a Central Cancer Survivorship Platform to integrate predicted risks presented with interpretable scores into a patient portal and EHR, and to inform clinicians and survivors about potential adverse-event risks for risk management/intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop survivor-specific risk models to predict adverse outcomes of childhood cancer through collecting daily symptoms and other patient-generated health data (physical activity, sleep behavior, heart rate variability) using mobile health devices. We will apply machine/statistical learning methods to develop and validate risk prediction models, and use qualitative methods to receive input from clinicians and survivors for developing a user-friendly dashboard and decision support tools. Our risk prediction tool will facilitate informing individualized levels of specific adverse outcomes, and providing key information for clinicians and survivors to discuss in view of preventive interventions.",Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes,10178979,R01CA258193,"['18 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Late Effects', 'Link', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'associated symptom', 'behavioral health', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'care providers', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'dashboard', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'outcome prediction', 'patient portal', 'patient variability', 'personalized risk prediction', 'premature', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep behavior', 'sociodemographic factors', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web-based tool']",NCI,ST.

"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support.

"AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-20-034, the proposed Alzheimer’s-focused supplement will develop Connecting Audio And Radio Sensing Systems To Improve Care At Home for persons with early Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) and their caregivers. The research proposed in this supplement aligns with the parent R01 study (R01LM013329). Persons with ADRD and their caregivers routinely confront various complex challenges and experience huge care burden. A common practice in technology-assisted care intervention is to guide patients and family caregivers through web and mobile phone-based training, health-vital monitoring, symptom reporting, and providing feedback and advice. These intervention programs, while have been shown to be effective, have three major demerits. First, a member of the care team (the patient or a family member) has to actively measure and enter patient data into the system, which is error-prone, subjective, and sometimes, forgotten. Second, web or mobile-based interactions can be cumbersome and demanding. Simple tasks like entering data, assessing health status, or getting and responding to an alert require typing and clicking through a series of electronic forms. Third, interactions between the system and the caregiver, especially when the system needs to remind or confirm an intervention, simple notifications and messages on a smartphone/website is often ineffective and unnoticed. To improve technology-based care interventions and to better serve persons with ADRD and their caregivers, the proposed study will adopt a user-centered approach to adapt and extend the AURA system that we have been developing in our ongoing R01. The research aims are: 1) Increase the robustness of the AURA subsystems; 2) Engage stakeholders (persons with early ADRD, caregivers, clinicians) to identify the needs of ADRD care and caregiving to help co-produce AURA-ALZ for persons with early ADRD and their caregivers; 3) Determine the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of AURA-ALZ in 10 persons with early ADRD and caregiver dyads' homes using mixed methods. Our current R01 aims to develop a technology- assisted AURA system for patients who are post-surgical treatment for bladder cancer and their caregivers. AURA passively monitors specific activities of a patient at home using WiFi signals, tailors natural language responses of voice assistants based on the patient's state, and automates entering data into the system to reduce the burden on the caregivers of cancer. AURA communicates with the care team in natural languages for reminders and confirmation of collected information, which is intuitive, handsfree, and less demanding. Building upon AURA, AURA-ALZ will have similar but enhanced features to address the unique care needs of persons with ADRD and caregivers. This study addresses the NLM’s mission of enabling biomedical research, supporting health care and public health, and promoting healthy behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the proposed study, we plan to adopt a user-centered approach to develop AURA-ALZ, an extended and adapted version of our innovative eHealth AURA program, to meet the needs of persons with ADRD and their caregivers. Different from previous interventions that focus on counseling, support groups, education, and skills training, AURA-ALZ will provide continuous monitoring of daily activities and gestures using a novel WiFi-based sensing technique, and enable voice-based user interactions, automated reminders, and hands-free surveys for guiding future individualized interventions for persons with early ADRD, which will help reduce caregiver burden, and ultimately, improve the health outcomes of the patients and caregivers.",AURA-ALZ: Connecting Audio and Radio Sensing Systems to Improve Care at Home for Persons with Early Alzheimer's Disease Or Related Dementias And Their Caregivers,10289180,R01LM013329,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Auras', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Patient', 'Car Phone', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'cognitive ability', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'dementia caregiving', 'eHealth', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional loss', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'learning classifier', 'member', 'multi-component intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'radio frequency', 'remote health care', 'research study', 'response', 'skills training', 'usability', 'web site']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,75537
"The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities Very little is known about the impact of locally-mandated COVID-19 mitigation policies such as Non- Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) on the health and wellbeing of medically and economically vulnerable populations such as American Indians (AI) living in rural tribal lands. There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of already implemented measures on the spread of COVID-19, the social and economic impact of those measures in these communities, and the potential spillover effects on non-AIAN communities. The staggered nature of the NPI implementation in tribal lands and the independence of sovereign nations’ policy decisions from local (e.g. county-level) policies present a unique quasi-natural experiment in policy timing, allowing us to study spillover effects from tribal NPIs to connected non-tribal areas. Our research efforts seek to improve American Indian health by understanding and evaluating these NPI measures on an NIH-designated disparity community. This R01 proposal has four specific aims: (1) Identify whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the early closure of American Indian reservations and/or tribal casinos among Native and non-Native populations living on and off of adjacent reservation lands. (2) Identify the change in commuter patterns and movement behaviors as a result of NPIs. (3) Use in-time claims data to analyze how the implementation of NPIs and the progression of the epidemic affected utilization of different non-COVID-19 health care services and facilities. (4) Conduct a survey of American Indians living in rural areas to create a new primary data resource and cross-validate the results we obtain through analysis of secondary data of cell phone traffic flows. The long- term goal of this proposal is to develop and validate analytical tools that could be applied with large secondary datasets to aid the evaluation and design of public policies to address public health emergencies in AI populations. Our central hypothesis is that the timely implementation of tribal NPIs reduced the incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in AI communities and in traffic-connected areas. However, we also expect that the secondary effects of NPIs, such as economic hardship and under-utilization of non-COVID-related health care, would be stronger on tribal lands. We will use an innovative two-pronged approach to combine empirical analysis of secondary big data sources with primary data collection to provide robust evidence on the current and future effects of these policies. This proposal is significant because the impact of COVID-19 and related policies on tribal communities is under-researched, under-funded, and not well understood, and yet relevant not only for AI tribal policies and populations but for regional health and economic policies. Our research is guided by the C.A.R.E. Principles of Indigenous Data Governance developed by our team members. It is innovative because it applies techniques from economics, computer science and public health to deliver actionable results and recommendations for future policy implementation. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies have been shown to disparately impact socially vulnerable and under-served minority groups in the US. This proposed study develops an innovative approach to analyzing the effects of COVID-19 mitigation policies on American Indian populations living on tribal lands and in rural areas, by integrating big data and deep learning techniques with primary data collection.

"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,10155597,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188709

"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals Project Summary/Abstract This Administrative Supplement proposes the participation of a 3-member team from the Center for Progressive Recovery, LLC (CPR) in the Innovation Corps (I-Corps™), an intensive, 8-week program focused on developing a successful commercialization plan and business model for technology-driven start-ups funded by NIH’s SBIR Phase I mechanism. The program would entail training, as well as structure and accountability around conducting 100 interviews with key stakeholders and others whose expertise would inform the company’s plans. The SBIR Phase I award to CPR (the small business concern, SBC) that this application is predicated on addresses the problem that the people at the greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice- involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for this population are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. We will disrupt system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot. This will be the only tool needed to receive a referral to a bup provider. We will also address low individual motivation with the chatbot by programming it to deliver the efficacious Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) without the need for a trained human. Our aims are: Aim 1: Design and develop a prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (HCD) interviews with key stakeholders; and (b) creation of a chatbot using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) that is integrated with a mobile application; Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to the BNI Chatbot or Digital Resources (i.e., Digitally-delivered OUD and buprenorphine education and referral resources). The following 3-member team has deep expertise in developing and bringing to market digital health solutions and was formed to pursue the unique benefits of the I-Corps program. All 3 are able to meet the time-intensive requirements of the training program: 1) Michael V. Pantalon, Ph.D., CEO; 2) Marianne S. Pantalon, Ph.D., PI, and 3) Thomas Wheeler, Industry Expert and CTO. With this sophisticated program, CPR would be in a much better position to secure SBIR Phase II funding.

"Automated Assessment for Robotic Suturing Utilizing Deep Learning Algorithms ABSTRACT Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US at a cost of $20 billion annually. Surgical complications account for a third of these deaths and cost. Surgical performance directly impacts patient outcomes. Prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men, is treated with surgery (robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP)) that can lead to impotence, incontinence, and even death. Reliable means of objectively assessing technique are required. In this project we will focus on assessing surgeon suturing skills during RARP through virtual reality (VR) simulation. Suturing is a common skill in many types of surgeries, can be tracked with performance metrics, and has been correlated with patient outcomes after RARP. In this proposal we seek to first determine the critical sub-step maneuvers of suturing and the technical skills necessary to achieve them successfully (Aim 1a). Further, we intend to develop an automated skills assessment pipeline through the analysis of raw kinematic data (Aim 1b), video (Aim 2b), and both kinematic/video (Aim 2c), from VR simulation performance by innovative machine learning strategies and deep-learning-based computer vision. The primary differentiator of the proposed work is determining how well granular sub-step maneuvers in suturing are performed. Surgeons participating in this study will not only provide data through their VR simulation performance, but will also contribute real patient data from the RARP to establish the relationship between surgeon skill, patient factors, and surgical outcomes. Statistical modeling will measure the differential impact of surgeon skill and patient factors to patient outcomes (Aim 3). We hypothesize that innovative application of machine learning algorithms can accurately assess surgeon technical skills, and can further anticipate likelihood of relevant clinical outcomes. The proposed work will enable scalable and actionable feedback in VR, empowering surgeons with valuable knowledge to minimize surgical risk in live surgery.

"Leveraging deep learning and clinical notes for surveillance and prediction of intentional self-harm and suicide PROJECT SUMMARY: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. The identification of individuals at risk for suicide is an important step for a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention. Despite extensive research on risk factors for intentional self-harm and suicide, prospective prediction of suicide remains a difficult task with poor predictive power. Recent studies suggest that new machine learning methods applied to electronic health records (EHR) show promising results. However, more advanced computational approaches such as deep learning, have not been fully leveraged in this field, especially in the area of advanced methods for text classification of clinical notes. Our aims in this project, are to improve the phenotyping of suicidal behavior, and the prediction of future suicidal behavior and suicide deaths by integrating mortality data with EHR data and leveraging state-of-the-art natural language computational approaches. We will also investigate methods for explain ability and interpretability of the models to improve future adoption by clinicians. We will validate our models by examining reproducibility and generalizability across two health systems using similar data at both sites. Project Narrative Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. In this project, we plan to improve the identification of patients at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior, by linking mortality data with electronic health records data and using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence such as deep learning.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,10063043,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,498501
"Enhancing Assisted Reproductive Technologies with Deep Learning and Data Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) is a clinical treatment for infertile couples who want to achieve a pregnancy. In ART, embryologists fertilize eggs retrieved from the patient or a donor, culture the resulting embryos in vitro, and then transfer the selected embryo(s) to the mother's uterus. While ART is responsible for 1.9% of babies born in the United States as of 2018, selecting which embryo to transfer is a signiﬁcant challenge. The difﬁculty comes from the complexity of confounding factors and the lack of understanding of human pre-implantation embryo development. Because of this difﬁculty, multiple embryos are often transferred to increases the potential of success, resulting in multiple pregnancy rates of nearly 20%, which can lead to signiﬁcant morbidity and medical expenses to patients. The ideal is to transfer only a single embryo, but this necessitates the ability to select the best embryo from a cohort. Here, we propose to create a clinical decision support system to improve embryo selection in ART. To this end, we will develop novel deep learning models for robust embryo feature extraction and interactive data visualization methods for human-in-the-loop analysis. We will ﬁrst extract and analyze visual features from routinely collected images of embryos. We will then combine these visual features with patients' electronic health record (EHR) data to develop interpretable computation models that score embryos on their viability. We plan to integrate our machine learning solutions into an easily accessible cloud service platform that will be adaptable across clinics to improve ART embryo selection and clinical data analysis. Our research goals will be achieved by novel machine learning-based models for morphological feature extrac- tion and importance estimation of each confounding factor and a clinical decision support system for ART. For morphological feature extraction, we plan to conduct semi-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks to minimize manual labeling that requires extensive human effort. Our feature extraction model will be the ﬁrst comprehensive classiﬁcation and segmentation method for ART. To aid in embryo selection, we will develop novel deep learning-based models to predict probabilities of achieving pregnancy by accepting visual features and EHR data as the input. We will also develop visual analytic tools that allow analysts to better understand and steer these deep learning models. We will estimate the importance of each input interpretable factor in embryo selection to explain the prediction to embryologists. Finally, we will develop EmbryoProﬁler, a clinical decision support system for ART, that combines our machine learning-based models with a user-facing suite of visual analytic tools to support user guidance and clinical decision making. EmbryoProﬁler will help facilitate daily operation in clinics, foster human-guided decision making, enrich data-driven embryo analysis, and enhance the ability to select the developmentally most competent embryo for transfer to improve ART success rates. Our project will create state-of-the-art analysis approaches for ART clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a widespread treatment for infertility, over 300,000 treatment cycles were performed in the US in 2018, but success rates remain low. In this project, we will develop novel machine learning algorithms and a clinical decision support system to assist embryologists in embryo selection. Our tools will also enable embryologists and biologists to obtain new information on the earliest stages of human embryo development, which will advance the fundamental science of human biology and lead to further improvements in ART practice.",Enhancing Assisted Reproductive Technologies with Deep Learning and Data Visualization,10185936,R01HD104969,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Back', 'Cell Lineage', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cloud Service', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'E-learning', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embryo', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Embryonic Development', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Mothers', 'Multiple Pregnancy', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pre-implantation Embryo Development', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Privacy', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Text', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Uterus', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blastocyst', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data cleaning', 'data curation', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'embryo cell', 'embryo monitoring', 'feature extraction', 'human-in-the-loop', 'implantation', 'improved', 'infertility treatment', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'model design', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'zygote']",NICHD,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,730410
"Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer Project Summary. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven, medical imaging platform that utilizes computed tomography (CT) imaging to identify the presence of extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a debilitating disease with significant patient-related morbidity related to the disease itself and its management, which is complex and consists of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A key factor in determining proper HNSCC management is the presence of ENE, which occurs when tumor infiltrates through the capsule of an involved lymph node into the surrounding tissue. ENE is both an important prognostic factor and an indication for adjuvant treatment escalation with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation following surgery. This “trimodality therapy” is problematic, as it is associated with increased treatment-related morbidity and healthcare costs, but no improvement in disease control compared to upfront chemoradiation alone. The challenge is that ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE identification has proven unreliable for even expert diagnosticians, leading to high rates of trimodality therapy and suboptimal treatment outcomes. In HNSCC management there is a critical need for improved pretreatment ENE identification to 1) select appropriate patients for surgery to avoid the excess morbidity and costs of trimodality therapy, 2) risk-stratify patients optimally, and 3) select appropriate patients for treatment de-escalation or intensification clinical trials. In recent years, Deep learning, a subtype of machine learning, under the umbrella of AI, has generated breakthroughs in computerized medical image analysis, at times outperforming human experts and discovering patterns hidden to the naked eye. While AI is poised to transform the fields of cancer imaging and personalized cancer care, there remain significant barriers to clinical implementation. The hypothesis of this project is that AI can be used to successfully identify HNSCC ENE on pretreatment imaging in retrospective and prospective patient cohorts and to develop a platform for lymph node auto-segmentation that will promote clinical utility of the platform. This hypothesis will be tested by rigorous optimization and evaluation of a deep learning ENE identification platform. Specifically, the platform will be validated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory performance on two heterogeneous retrospective datasets and two prospective cohorts derived from institutional and national Phase II clinical trials for HNSCC patients. The platform will then be directly compared with head and neck radiologists to determine if radiologist performance can be augmented with AI. In parallel, AI will be utilized to develop an auto-segmentation platform for tumor and lymph nodes, which will 1) improve the platform's clinical impact and 2) provide a valuable tool for treatment planning and future imaging-based research for HNSCC patients. 1 Project Narrative Identification of extranodal extension (ENE) for head and neck cancer in the pretreatment setting would be extremely useful in selecting the optimal treatment strategy for patients. Currently, ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE prediction has proven unreliable for expert diagnosticians. This project uses artificial intelligence to identify ENE pretreatment on Computed Tomography, with the goal of developing a clinically usable tool to help patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancers and their physicians choose the most effective treatment strategy that minimizes the risk of side effects.","Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer",10105483,K08DE030216,"['Adjuvant', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Extranodal', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck Dissection', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prospective cohort', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'capsule', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'heuristics', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient stratification', 'personalized cancer care', 'phase II trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk minimization', 'risk stratification', 'side effect', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIDCR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,168240
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,10136061,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579506
"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. This application overcomes these barriers by applying cutting- edge approaches in machine learning to analyze complex imaging data for individuals with kidney stone disease.The Center’s strategic vision of using machine learning to generate knowledge that improves diagnosis, risk stratification strategies, and prediction of outcomes among children and adults will be achieved through the implementation of a Educational Enrichment Program and a Research Project.",Center for Machine Learning in Urology,10260577,P20DK127488,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internships', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologist', 'Urology', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'complex data', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'human error', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'routine imaging', 'senior faculty', 'skills', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'tool', 'urologic', 'web page']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,P20,2021,332101

"Artificial intelligence Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK) PROJECT SUMMARY  Contemporary ocular surgeries are performed by skilled surgeons through operating microscopes, utilizing freehand techniques and manually operated precision micro-instruments, where the outcomes are often limited by the surgeon's skill levels and experiences. To overcome these human factors, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team including a clinician-scientist and eye surgeon, an optical device scientist and medical robotic engineers to translate existing and developing technologies in our laboratories into precision, “deep- learning” artificial intelligence (AI) guided robotic ocular surgical devices for precise automated Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK).  DALK is a highly attractive treatment of corneal disease with normally functioning endothelium. However, the procedure is unusually challenging from a technical perspective and time-consuming, limiting its acceptance among corneal surgeons. The most challenging aspect of the procedure is related to the delamination of stroma from Descemet's membrane (DM). A procedure, commonly called “Big Bubble” is used to separate stroma from DM using deep intrastromal pneumatic injection. However, even experienced surgeons have difficulty precisely placing the injection. The most common complication of DALK is the excessive depth of the needle insertion resulting in Descemet's membrane perforation requiring conversion to full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty with its much longer recovery period and a higher risk of graft failure from rejection. The reported rates of Descemet's membrane perforation for beginner and experienced surgeons are 31.8% and 11.7% respectively. In addition, interface haze between the donor and recipient cornea is a common problem caused by the insufficient depth of needle insertion and failure to remove the host stromal tissue, which results in loss of postoperative visual acuity. These problems relate directly to the inability of the current surgical practice to precisely assess the depth of the tooltips inside the cornea layer in real-time.  Here we will build upon our previous and ongoing work in robust fiber optic common-path optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT) and AI-guide system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) robotic microsurgical tools that enable clinicians to precisely guide surgical tools at micron scale. The proposed AUTO- DALK surgical tool system is capable of one-dimensional real-time depth tracking, motion compensation, and detection of early instrument contact with tissue, which enables clinicians to perform DALK precisely and safely. The tool will be built on a handheld platform that will consist of CP-OCT probe, trephine and microinjector that allows precise and safe removal of the anterior section of cornea down to DM  We hypothesize that AI-OCT providing intelligent visualization and depth controlled optimal cornea cutting and tissue tracking will perform the task of DALK with better accuracy and efficiency over the manually performed trephine cutting and “Big Bubble” pneumodissection. Project Narrative  This proposal addresses fundamental limitations in current corneal transplant surgery by developing an artificial intelligence guided compact robotic surgical tool that could empower corneal surgeons to achieve difficult surgical objectives, reduce intraoperative complications, and improve clinical outcomes when performing Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK). Further, these capabilities are broadly applicable in other microsurgical problems, and the tools will enable further advances both for ophthalmology and for other microsurgical disciplines.",Artificial intelligence Optical Coherence Tomography Guided Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (AUTO-DALK),10100636,R01EY032127,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Burr hole procedure', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Consumption', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Corneal Opacity', 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Data', 'Descemet&apos', 's membrane', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endophthalmitis', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Excision', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Eye Surgeon', 'Failure', 'Fiber Optics', 'Financial compensation', 'Geometry', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Graft Survival', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Intelligence', 'Intraoperative Complications', 'Iris', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laboratories', 'Lamellar Keratoplasty', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Needles', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Penetrating Keratoplasty', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Ptosis', 'Recovery', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Rupture', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Topical Corticosteroids', 'Translating', 'Transplantation Surgery', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'corneal scar', 'curative treatments', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'graft failure', 'high risk', 'iatrogenic injury', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrument', 'interest', 'novel', 'phantom model', 'photonics', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'skills', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,409997
"Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 44,000 people died by suicide in the U.S. in 2016 and national rates continue to increase. The majority of people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their death. Major hurdles to implementing suicide prevention in healthcare settings include the lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training routine healthcare providers in suicide prevention. Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence may overcome these hurdles as it is now possible for technology to assess the quality of provider skill in intervention delivery and provide opportunities for skill acquisition and practice. The candidate's long-term goal is to harness technological advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of training among general medical providers in suicide prevention. The proposed research and training activities will take place at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA, a county safety-net hospital and level I trauma center serving patients across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The research aims to adapt and deploy existing scalable technology to train frontline trauma center providers (e.g., nurses) to collaboratively engage patients in a suicide safety planning intervention (SPI) and conduct a pilot feasibility trial of the resultant training. Aim 1 includes focus groups with trauma nurses to identify individual, setting, and organizational-level implementation barriers and facilitators based on the Theoretical Domains Framework and inform strategies for engaging nurses in training and delivery of the SPI with patients. Aim 1 also includes the user-centered design method of contextual inquiry, including task analysis, with nurses to inform workflow- integration. Aim 2 includes user-centered design methods to identify technology refinements and adaptations based on nurse preferences to increase usability. The technologies are a 1) conversational agent, with simulated patient role-play and real-time feedback, and 2) AI-based feedback of counseling performance from SPI audio recordings. Aim 3 is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a technology-enhanced provider training as compared to a web-based didactic only condition. The longitudinal trial will include 20 nurses (10 per condition), each with 3 patients, and support submission of an NIMH R01 full-scale trial. The K23 training goals include building knowledge and skills in 1) technology-focused team science, 2) the application and integration of implementation science, user-centered design, and adult learning theory for technology adaptation and integration for nurse training, 3) acute care suicide prevention clinical trials research, including the responsible conduct of research with patients at-risk for suicide, and statistical methods for low base-rate outcomes and nested longitudinal clinical trials data. This K23 application addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan by developing strategies incorporating information technology and pragmatic feedback systems for suicide prevention efforts in real-world practice, reaching the full breadth of patients presenting to the health care system after injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the United States approximately 30 million individuals require emergency department visits; 1.5- 2.5 million are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospitalization and over 650,000 patients present for self-inflicted injury. Acute care medical settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient trauma units, present critical opportunities for suicide prevention, which is stymied by a lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training providers in high quality suicide prevention interventions. The proposed K23 harnesses advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of suicide prevention training among acute medical care providers to better reach the population of patients at-risk for suicide with potentially life-saving interventions.",Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning,10210226,K23MH118361,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alaska', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empathy', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Idaho', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Montana', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Partnership Practice', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Theoretical Domains framework', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Trauma Nursing', 'Trauma patient', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Wyoming', 'acute care', 'base', 'care providers', 'college', 'computerized', 'coping', 'evidence base', 'feasibility trial', 'health care settings', 'implementation barriers', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevention clinical trial', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'responsible research conduct', 'safety net', 'screening', 'severe injury', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'task analysis', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'trauma units', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2021,150756
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, compare clinical management of hypertension with and without information from the MLA on whether a patient will have uncontrolled blood pressure through a case-vignette study.",Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia,10167764,K01HL151974,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Bass', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Education', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Length of Stay', 'Life Style Modification', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Intervention', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Technics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Zoran', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'informant', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication compliance', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'underserved area']",NHLBI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,K01,2021,147931
"Intelligent Intensive Care Unit (I2CU): Pervasive Sensing and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Clinical Decision-making Project Summary Although close monitoring and dynamic assessment of patient acuity are key aspects of ICU care, both are limited by the time constraints imposed on healthcare providers. Currently, dynamic and precise assessment of patient’s acuity in ICU rely almost exclusively on physicians’ clinical judgment and vigilance. Furthermore, important visual assessment details, such as facial expressions, posture, and mobility, are captured sporadically by overburdened nurses or are not captured at all. However, these visual assessment details are associated with critical indices such as physical function, pain and subsequent clinical deterioration. The PIs’ long-term goal is to sense, quantify, and communicate patient’s clinical condition in an autonomous and precise manner. The overall objective of this application is to develop the novel tools for sensing, quantifying, and communicating any patient’s condition in an autonomous, precise, and interpretable manner. The central hypothesis is that deep learning models will be superior to existing acuity clinical scores by predicting acuity in a dynamic, precise, and interpretable manner, using autonomous assessment of pain, emotional distress and physical function, together with clinical and physiologic data. The hypothesis has been formulated based on preliminary data and is well-grounded in clinical care literature. The rationale is that autonomous and precise patient quantification can result in enhanced clinical workflow and early intervention. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the patient’s clinical status to determine if it is more accurate in predicting daily care transition outcomes, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous visual assessment of critically ill patients to determine if it can provide accurate visual assessment of a patient compared to human expert, and if it can enrich acuity prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Implementing and evaluating an intelligent platform for real- time integration of autonomous visual assessment and acuity prediction in clinical workflow to determine accuracy in real-time prospective evaluation and to determine physicians’ risk perception and satisfaction. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise patient trajectory, (2) autonomously perform visual assessment in the ICU, and (3) implement artificial intelligence platform in real time in clinical workflow. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time prediction of clinical trajectory, (2) manual repetitive ICU assessments, and (3) uncaptured patient aspects. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",Intelligent Intensive Care Unit (I2CU): Pervasive Sensing and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Clinical Decision-making,10154047,R01EB029699,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Facial Expression', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'advanced disease', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease diagnosis', 'emotional distress', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'risk perception', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'vigilance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,632088
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data.

"Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system Project Summary/Abstract This SBIR Phase I project will develop a deep learning-based algorithm to analyze the sound of blood flow in mature arterio-venous (AV) fistulas used for hemodialysis access. This monitoring tool can help to identify fistulas with impending failure in patients who are in need of surgical intervention to ensure patency of the patient’s hemodialysis access. The specific aims of the study are (1) to create the world’s first deep learning-scale database of mature AV fistula sounds paired with ultrasound imaging from hemodialysis patients, and (2) develop and evaluate the performance of a deep learning classification model trained via semi-supervised learning to discriminate between patients with patent fistulas and patients with failing fistulas. By integrating this deep learning algorithm into Eko’s mobile and cloud software platform, we anticipate this algorithm will enable better monitoring for failing fistulas. During Phase I of the project we will recruit study subjects in vascular surgery and interventional radiology clinics at Columbia University Medical Center. The follow-up SBIR Phase II project will extend our algorithm to account for (1) broader forms of hemodialysis access including AV grafts, which often fail more frequently than fistulas, and premature fistulas, which are often abandoned, and (2) longitudinal collection and analysis of hemodialysis access sounds at commercial dialysis centers and in patients’ homes. SBIR Project Narrative In creating the world’s largest annotated dataset of mature AV fistula sounds and corresponding ultrasounds, Eko will gain unprecedented insights into fistula blood flow. We expect this to advance our scientific understanding of the fluid dynamics of fistulas, and help explain how and why hemodialysis access fails at such a high rate over time. A clinical decision support algorithm trained from this dataset can help healthcare systems detect fistula failures earlier, leading to more timely interventions that can avert costly complications, prolong life expectancy, and improve quality of life for hemodialysis patients as their care transitions from clinic to home care.",Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system,10255460,R43DK129107,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auscultation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Bluetooth', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Eko', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Fistula', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Sounds', 'Hemodialysis', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life Expectancy', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Research Design', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stethoscopes', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'algorithm training', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cloud software', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data streams', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'patient home care', 'premature', 'recruit', 'skills', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NIDDK,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R43,2021,299358
"AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition ABSTRACT Dietary intake is a complex human behavior that drives disease risk and corresponding economic and healthcare burdens worldwide. Poor diet is the leading cause of death in the US and a known driver of obesity – a global epidemic. A major contributor to poor diet is food eaten away from home, such as restaurant foods. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods. Accurate approaches and tools to evaluate food and nutrient intake are essential in monitoring the nutritional status of individuals. There is a critical need for real-time data capture that minimizes burden and reduces error. While progress has been made, there is no tool available that accurately and automatically estimates foods left unconsumed in a meal. Two major limitations of existing systems is the reliance of a fiducial marker for food detection and volume estimation, and reliance on humans – either the respondent or a trained researcher – to estimate the portion of food leftover. This application leverages novel technology to remove those limitations. The long-term research goal is to utilize digital imaging (DI), artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) techniques to develop a novel hybrid methodology for rapid, accurate measurement of dietary intake. To attain this goal, our objective in this R21 application is to refine and test a system architecture that (a) uses digital images to record dietary intake in real-time and (b) uses AI and CV techniques to identify food/beverage items and determine amounts leftover. We plan to build on our current prototype in which digital food images are captured before and after the meal, analyzed to detect the food items, a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual model constructed, and volume remaining after the meal estimated, which will be used to calculate the amount leftover based on the initial volume. Volume consumed will be converted to weight and linked to public-use nutrition information. These calorie estimates will be compared against calories those from (a) DIs coded by trained research staff and (b) weighed plate waste methodology. Our expectation is to develop a valid system architecture for rapidly estimating dietary intake. The outcome of this proposal is expected to have a significant positive impact, enabling nutrition and health researchers to collect high-quality food consumption data in real world settings, increasing knowledge of dietary patterns and improving capacity to assess dietary interventions. This work will lead to an R01 application that will expand food types and meal settings and test the utility of our system among consumers. Project Narrative Solutions to address the global obesity epidemic are urgently needed. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods, a known driver of obesity. This study integrates nutrition science, computer science, and engineering to develop and test a new method for assessing dietary intake, and if successful would yield a rapid, reliable, accurate and cost- effective tool.",AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition,10163822,R21CA250024,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Science', 'Nutritional status', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respondent', 'Restaurants', 'Side', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'dietary', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'food quality', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'prototype', 'success', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'virtual model', 'wasting', 'weight maintenance']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R21,2021,197745
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this field typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind  admission risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modifiable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital  admissions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classification models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to significantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close  mentoring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a  supportive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identification and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,10134412,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,173801
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,10080366,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2021,161047
"Identifying treatment responders in medication trials for AUD using machine learning approaches ABSTRACT Alcohol use disorder (AUD), as defined in DSM-5, represents a highly prevalent, costly, and often untreated condition in the United States. Pharmacotherapy offers a promising avenue for treating AUD and for improving clinical outcomes for this debilitating disorder. While developing novel medications to treat AUD remains a high priority research area, there remain major opportunities to further elucidate clinical response in completed medication trials. To that end, a key question in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is which patients respond to a given pharmacotherapy. Identifying treatment responders provides major opportunities to advance clinical care for AUD by personalizing medication practices on the bases of variables/predictors of good clinical response. For example, while the effect size for medications such as naltrexone is deemed small-to-moderate, a host of studies over the past decade have shown that its effect size may be considerably larger for certain subgroups of patients. Towards advancing precision medicine for AUD and leveraging data from a host of carefully conducted RCTs for AUD, this R03 application seeks to conduct secondary data analysis. Specifically, we propose to analyze data from four RCTs conducted by the NIAAA Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG). These state-of-the-art RCTs for AUD have tested the following pharmacotherapies: (a) quetiapine, (b) Levetiracetam XR (Keppra XR®), (c) Varenicline (Chantix®), and (d) HORIZANT® (Gabapentin Enacarbil) Extended-Release. In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in the NCIG RCTs. Machine learning represents a highly promising and underutilized data analytic strategy in the field of AUD treatment response. Machine learning models prioritize the ability to predict future outcomes over creating perfectly fitting models for the data at hand. This results in models which are more generalizable to future observations, which fits well with our goal of identifying responders in RCTs. Leveraging data from these pivotal RCTs through secondary data analysis and using novel analytic methods, namely machine learning, provides a cost-effective approach to identifying AUD pharmacotherapy responders.

"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder.

"Using Search Engine Data for Detection and Early Intervention in Suicide Prevention ABSTRACT. Decades of research to improve the prevention and early detection of suicide risk has largely resulted in the detection of who is most likely to consider suicide, but not when or if that is most likely to happen. Most detection methods presume patients are in contact with the healthcare system, which only reaches a proportion of the at-risk population. Many people at high risk for suicide do not seek professional help because of lack of time, stigma, and fear regarding how they will be treated in the health care system. It is imperative that we develop methods that can identify proximal risk for suicide that does not depend on system- level contact. Web-based search tools are ubiquitous, with 46% of the global population using the internet for information searches and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide. Based on our preliminary data, we propose that this online search-engine behavior may prove to be an effective, private, and immediate method of proximal risk detection of suicide for anyone, regardless of their contact with systems of care. We will recruit 1,000 people with mental illness with varying risk for suicide. Participants will provide us access to Google Take-Out (GTO) data, which includes search-engine history and behavior including YouTube. Participants will include those who have report a suicide attempt in the past year (N=500), those who have made an attempt over a year ago (N=250), and those who have thoughts of suicide but never attempted (N=250). All will participate using gold-standard suicide behavior research instruments. Using a case-crossover design, we will evaluate the intermittent exposures (search based proximal risk factors) with an immediate and transient effect on risk and an abrupt outcome (suicide attempt). The case-crossover design is a well-tested and proven approach especially in cases where transient events can trigger acute events such as cardiovascular events, injuries, and death due to environmental exposures and has been studied with interview data to determine warning signs for suicide attempts. Further for predicting suicidal attempt/s, we will use robust ensemble-based machine learning methods such as random forest, gradient boosting to evaluate the predictive nature of qualitative and quantitative features. The study will conclude in a collaborative dissemination planning process with our community partners. Thus, this retrospective and prospective study that aligns GTO data with carefully assessed suicidal thoughts and behaviors has the potential to identify warning signs in search and YouTube data that predict when suicidal risk and lay the groundwork for innovative pathways to suicide prevention. Narrative. Online search-engine behavior (Google and YouTube) may be an effective, private, and immediate method of suicide risk detection for anyone, regardless of their contact with systems of care. In this study, participants who made a suicide attempt in the past year (N=500), those who have made an attempt but over a year ago (N=250), and those who have thoughts of suicide but never attempted (N=250) will complete gold- standard research assessments of suicidal thoughts and behavior and provide Google Take-Out Search and YouTube data. Using a case-crossover design, we will identify and evaluate proximal risk factors in search- engine behavior; that is, patterns that change at the time of suicidal behavior or increases in suicidal ideation and lay the groundwork for ethical, feasible, and acceptable online interventions that can be deployed immediately when suicide risk is high.",Using Search Engine Data for Detection and Early Intervention in Suicide Prevention,10207109,R01MH123484,"['Acute', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Facebook', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care systems', 'cohort', 'cost', 'detection method', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'information seeking behavior', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'online intervention', 'predictive tools', 'prevention service', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'screening', 'search engine', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,876668
"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, there are nearly 13,000 patients waitlisted for liver transplant, yet only two-thirds will receive a transplant, and in 2018 approximately 2,500 patients died or were removed from the waitlist due to medical deterioration. This shortage of donor livers available for transplant has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are higher risk than typical donor livers but may be safely transplantable in carefully selected recipients. These include older donors (>70 years), steatotic livers, and livers procured through donation after cardiac death. Due to their riskiness, these marginal livers are often declined, yet as many as 84% of patients who died on the transplant waitlist declined one or more marginal livers prior to death. In light of this, certain waitlisted candidates might have derived a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a marginal organ rather than remaining on the waitlist (i.e. they would have survived longer after a transplant with a marginal liver than they would have survived on the waitlist). Currently, decisions about whether a particular marginal liver is suitable for a particular candidate are based on clinical gestalt or simple subgroup analysis using traditional regression models, which likely do not fully approximate the complex interactions between donor, recipient, and transplant factors. To account for this, we will utilize machine learning (which can incorporate complex, higher-order interactions) to predict whether a specific candidate would derive a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a specific marginal liver, and interview transplant candidates and surgeons to understand how best to translate these predictions into an immediately clinically-useful decision aid. To accomplish this, we will leverage Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) national data (n=293,140) and use a machine technique (random forests) to address the following aims: (1) To predict waitlist survival for waitlisted liver transplant candidates; (2) To predict post-transplant survival for liver transplant recipients of a marginal liver; and (3) To create a decision aid that compares predicted waitlist survival and predicted post-transplant survival for a specific transplant candidates with marginal liver. These aims are highly feasible given our group’s expertise in liver transplantation, analysis of national registry data, and machine learning techniques. We hypothesize that utilizing SRTR and machine learning, we can accurately predict post-transplant survival for a particular candidate with a particular marginal liver, as well as waitlist survival for that same candidate without a liver. We also hypothesize that our decision aid could be utilized in real-time to inform clinical decision-making. If the proposed aims are achieved, our decision aid could be utilized to improve clinical practice by bringing high-quality risk prediction directly to patients and transplant professionals to directly inform the real-time clinical decision of whether a candidate should undergo transplant with a marginal liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are far fewer donor livers available for transplant than patients who need them, which has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are riskier than typical donor livers but yet might still provide a benefit to carefully selected patients. However, the decision to use a particular marginal liver for a particular patient is based largely on clinical gestalt or traditional clinical studies, which likely do not account for the complex relationships between donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics. To optimally inform the decision to undergo transplantation with a marginal liver or not, we propose to utilize machine learning to generate personalized risk predictions of post-transplant survival with that specific marginal liver and waitlist survival without that liver, and then develop a decision aid to be used by patients and surgeons to compare predicted survival between both options.",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation,10208791,F32DK124962,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Computing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survey Methodology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Transplantation', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'liver transplantation', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'post-transplant', 'programs', 'public health research', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'transplant registry', 'web site']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,84562
"Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in young children. There is no cure, but disciplined rehabilitation can improve outcomes. A critical component of rehabilitation is continuous assessment of patient function. Patients in rural areas can have difﬁculty accessing care. Telerehabilitation provides an option to extend access to care, but has limitations. The foci of this project are 1) understanding how a social robot physically co-located with the patient during a telerehabilitation assessment alters the activity by the patient, potentially leading to changes in the ability of the clinician to perform assessment and 2) whether computer vision and machine learning can be used to assess patients. Together, these two complementary goals will show a path forward for remote treatment of patients with CP and similar conditions.  The effect of using a social robot in telerehabilitation will be examined through a study where pediatric CP subjects and typical subjects interact with a remote operator in three conditions: face-to-face, over traditional telepresence, and over telepresence with a social robot present. Direct changes in the level of subject interaction and compliance will be measured through surveys and video coding. The effect on quality of assessment will be measured by presenting expert therapists with ﬁrst-person video recordings from each condition and comparing the variance of their grading for each condition.  To truly realize the promise of using remote assessment to extend care, automated grading of assessments is necessary. To evaluate the feasibility of this, videos of children with various levels of upper extremity function along with their box and block scores and clinician ratings will be used to train two algorithms. Both algorithms will begin by using off the shelf convolutional neural network based tools to extract the pose of the subjects. The ﬁrst algorithm will be hand designed. It will learn how to weight known metrics of motion, such as movement speed, time to maximum speed, and number of speed peaks, using principal component analysis and a naive Gaussian classiﬁer. The second algorithm will use a custom neural network operating directly on the time-series pose data. Both algorithms will attempt to, given video of a novel subject, predict the level of function as would be predicted by a therapist. Both algorithms will be analyzed to discover their underlying decision-making philosophies, which may give insight into what parameters of motion clearly differentiate levels of function.  The project will be done in the context of a pre-doctoral training plan. The plan focuses on developing an independent researcher at the intersection of robotics and rehabilitation science. This will be done within Mechanical Engineering, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania with additional mentorship and experience at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Limits to care for pediatric cerebral palsy patients in rural areas could be addressed through telepresence, but current technologies fail to adequately convey information. This project will explore whether combining social robots with telepresence systems and computer vision can improve the quality of telerehabilitation for the purpose of remote assessment. The social robot will aid communication to the patient, motivating them through activities, while the computer vision automatically assesses function.",Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots,10285983,F31HD102165,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Exercise', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Improve Access', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Philadelphia', 'Philosophy', 'Physical Medicine', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'communication aid', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'motor disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'pre-doctoral', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation science', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'rural area', 'social assistive robot', 'telepresence', 'telerehabilitation', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
"Cardiac MR-Based Risk Stratification for Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in HCM Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, affecting as many as 1:200 individuals in the general population. HCM, initially described in the context of sudden cardiac death (SCD), is commonly associated with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Rigorous research over the past two decades has enabled us to identify HCM patients at the greatest risk of SCD who could benefit from a prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With advances in SCD prevention, HCM management has now shifted its focus to HF and AF. Nearly 50% of HCM patients have mild to severe HF symptoms. HF is now considered the most common cause of HCM-related mortality. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, occurring in nearly 25% of HCM patients, and responsible for a decreased quality of life and increased stroke risk. Currently, we are not able to predict which HCM patients are more likely to progress toward end-stage HF or develop AF. Cardiovascular imaging using echocardiography and cardiac MR has played a central role in our evolving understanding of HCM. Echocardiography provides a robust assessment of left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. With its high spatial resolution and remarkable tissue characterization capabilities, cardiac MR has emerged as an imaging modality well suited to characterize the HCM phenotype. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel risk stratification paradigms by leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve HCM patient management. We will investigate a deep learning (DL) risk model for prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes that incorporates (a) standard clinical and imaging parameters and (b) novel cardiac MR signatures extracted using (i) radiomic analysis (i.e. a computational method to automatically extract and select clinically significant imaging markers) or (ii) deep imaging signatures, extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The performance of these models will be rigorously evaluated using 3 HCM cohorts collected at Tufts Medical Center, BIDMC, and University of Toronto.

"Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk. Social determinants of health (SDH) refer to the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. A number of SDH are known risk factors for suicide. While SDH could be obtained from the structured EHR data, their scope is limited. A recent study has shown that EHR notes contain about 90 times more information about SDH than the structured data. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of EHR and new computational methdologies to explore associations between natural language processing extracted SDH and suicide ideation, attempt and death. This approach is critical to the development of next- generation suicide prevention tools.

"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice.

"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"Leveraging Big Data and Deep Learning to Develop Next Generation Decision Support Tools to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary The hallmark of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is insufficient insulin production caused by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Most people treat their T1D through multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or use of a transcutaneous insulin pump. Several decision support smartphone apps exist to help people estimate insulin doses based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data and food intake. More sophisticated decision support tools employ mathematical models of human physiology to predict future glucose levels and provide generalized insulin therapy recommendations. Exercise is a crucial component of the long-term management of T1D, however many people avoid physical activity for fear of hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL). While consensus guidelines exist to help people manage glucose during physical activity, people still experience acute complications. Mathematical models of aerobic exercise yield promise in predicting hypoglycemia during controlled in- clinic experiments but do not perform well in the real-world or during other types of exercise. There is a critical need for a decision support system that helps people with T1D maintain safe glucose levels around exercise of varying types. The goal of this proposal is to develop a decision support tool to help people with T1D who utilize CGM better manage their glucose surrounding exercise. This tool will be called AIDES, the Artificially Intelligent Diabetic Exercise Support system. We hypothesize that use of a novel exercise- specific decision support tool, powered by predictive physiological modelling, artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning, can provide treatment recommendations to reduce the number of hypoglycemic events experienced by people with T1D around regular physical exercise. In our first aim, we will develop a new model of resistance exercise that describes both insulin- and non-insulin mediated effects on glucose dynamics. We will then create a novel hybrid computational framework that harnesses AI to augment physiology models of aerobic and resistance exercise. This hybrid framework, called physAI, will harness real- world, free-living exercise data from the T1Dexi project (Big Data). In our second aim, we will leverage decades of research into deep learning with the Big Data provided by the T1Dexi project to train an AI-based decision support system that gives treatment recommendations to help users maintain target glucose during exercise. In our third aim, we will assess the safety and usability of our decision support engine in a small proof-of-concept study with human participants, supported by the Sponsor. This will be the first decision support system specifically designed to provide treatment recommendations that help users maintain safe glucose levels while performing aerobic and resistance exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 diabetes is difficult to manage during exercise, and few validated tools exist to recommend treatment options to avoid dangerous complications resulting from low blood glucose. This proposal combines physiological modelling and deep learning to develop a novel artificial intelligence decision support system to help multiple daily injection users maintain safe blood glucose levels during and after exercise. We will build and validate this system in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Leveraging Big Data and Deep Learning to Develop Next Generation Decision Support Tools to Improve Glycemic Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes,10231944,F30DK128914,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerobic', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intake', 'Jogging', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physical Exercise', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Structure of beta Cell of islet', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'base', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'exercise regimen', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'human model', 'human study', 'improved', 'in silico', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'smartphone Application', 'strength training', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics Abstract The primary objective is to develop an artificial intelligence-centric, quantitative and noninvasive software platform that can be integrated into 3D angiographic scanners (DSA, CTA or MRA) to provide guidance regarding the diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Hemorrhagic stroke secondary to ruptured IAs leads to significant morbidity and mortality and affects over 35,000 patients on a yearly basis in the United States. The diagnosis of asymptomatic IAs is on the rise with the increasing use of cerebral imaging. However, guidance regarding which aneurysms should be treated has not advanced. Leveraging recent advances in computational science and technology, particularly artificial intelligence, the proposed software platform built on two enabling technologies can (1) propel automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations into the clinical workflow and (2) conduct “data-driven” risk assessments of IA rupture on an individual basis. Specific research aims are to (1) develop a clinically-oriented CFD platform that enables automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations of IAs, (2) investigate data-driven analytics toward prediction of rupture risk for IAs and (3) evaluate the data-driven analytics in a blind study. Once validated, a follow-up R01 project is planned to examine the clinical utility of the proposed software platform in a prospective clinical study as a single gateway for computer-aided evaluation of cerebral aneurysms. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This R01 proposal is to investigate the feasibility of developing an innovative, non-invasive and artificial intelligence-centric tool that can be used as a software add-on to clinical angiographic (e.g. DSA) scanners. The software can automatically select high-risk aneurysms for immediate treatments from a pool of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, impacting the clinical management of intracranial aneurysms.",Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics,10121043,R01EB029570,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Genetic', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Natural History', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Secondary to', 'Smoker', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'blind', 'computer grid', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'open source', 'personalized management', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'shear stress', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,346966
"Using predictive analytics to tailor care for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Over 1.5 million US adults are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) each year. These newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing debilitating complications, including renal disease, strokes, and myocardial infarctions. However, individuals differ widely in their likelihood of experiencing these adverse outcomes. Individual risk varies based on a complex interplay between pathophysiology, responsiveness to treatment, and patient capacity for self-management and making sustained lifestyle changes. Early T2D glycemic control provides a lasting benefit (""metabolic memory""); therefore, strategies that enable the effective targeting and tailoring of T2D care starting in the initial period after diagnosis may result in better long-term health outcomes. Implementing individually-tailored care strategies requires substantially more effective risk prediction tools than are currently available. This R21 proposal seeks to apply advanced analytic prediction modeling methods to a rich source of electronic health record (EHR)-derived clinical data (assessed at the time of initial diagnosis and after a year of standard management) to define individual patient risk profiles. These patient risk profiles will incorporate differences in disease physiology (e.g., reflected in factors such as age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c at diagnosis), treatment responsiveness, and early self- management results (e.g., medication adherence, weekly exercise levels, weight loss). This R21 leverages an established, well-characterized cohort of adults with incident, newly-diagnosed T2D (n=67,575) within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We will apply advanced machine learning-based modeling methods (e.g., random forests, LASSO, extreme gradient boosting) to complete the following Aims: 1) Develop and validate a predictive model using EHR-derived patient data available at T2D diagnosis to identify patients at increased risk of suboptimal glycemic control over the five years following diagnosis and 2) Modify the Aim 1 model by incorporating clinical predictors captured during the first year following T2D diagnosis. We hypothesize that the unique information available at these two time points (i.e., initial diagnosis and after one year of standard treatment) can be used to individualize both initial and subsequent early care for patients with newly diagnosed T2D. If successful, this project's results can be applied to support targeted T2D care strategies tailored to each individual's risk of suboptimal five-year glycemic control (and later micro and macrovascular complications) based on differences in disease physiology, treatment response, and early self-care. This work will form the foundation for innovative, pragmatic clinical trials that advance our ultimate goal of providing proactive and effectively tailored early care that results in better long-term health outcomes for adults with T2D. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current initial type 2 diabetes care strategies are typically ""one-size-fits-all"" and do not address individual patient differences in risk of complications (like stroke, kidney disease), responsiveness to treatment, or ability to self-manage and successfully adopt lifestyle changes. We propose to apply advanced predictive modeling methods (including machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence) to data from the electronic health record to predict which newly diagnosed individuals are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes-related complications. The findings are intended to help clinicians individualize type 2 diabetes care from the beginning by creating optimal care plans that reduce complications and maintain long-term health.",Using predictive analytics to tailor care for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10286549,R21DK130018,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiology', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Preventive screening', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data repository', 'diabetes control', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'electronic data', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'macrovascular disease', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'sociodemographics', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2021,248958
"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10219952,R21AG065753,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Assessment tool', 'Awareness', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dehydration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Health Care Agencies', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicare claim', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'New York', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Services', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Visiting Nurse', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'health care settings', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'patient home care', 'patient subsets', 'racial and ethnic', 'study population', 'unstructured data']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2021,213501
"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,10190850,R01CA237269,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Beds', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Consultations', 'Curiosities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'negative affect', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,490133
"Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation Project Summary / Abstract  Almost 400,000 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occur each year in the United States. In patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for prolonged periods, current CPR methods are unable to maintain adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to the vital organs. Survival is <10% in patients with shockable rhythms and ~0% in those with non-shockable rhythms. Current American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for CPR follow a “one-size-fits-all” paradigm. Our goal is to improve vital organ perfusion during prolonged CPR by “personalizing” compression/decompression therapy with a dynamic CPR method that changes compression characteristics over the course of CPR after taking into account the temporal changes of chest wall compliance and hemodynamics in order to increase the rate of neurologically intact survival after OHCA.  In this grant proposal, we are investigating the deployment of machine learning algorithms incorporated into a mechanical CPR device to predict and optimize hemodynamics during CPR. We will use state-of-the-art dynamical modeling in conjunction with closed-loop control algorithms to individualize CPR characteristics and optimize temporal blood flow. Our preliminary results suggest that deployment of machine learning prediction algorithms paired with control algorithms in a preclinical Ventricular Fibrillation model can adapt compression and decompression depth in real time, resulting in increased vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques Based on these results, we hypothesize that optimization of compression depth, decompression depth, duty cycle, and compression rate of CPR will lead to better outcomes. Our proposed research will: 1) identify the most promising algorithm for the prediction of CPR hemodynamics 2) identify the best control algorithm to pair with this prediction algorithm in terms of optimizing CPR hemodynamics and return of spontaneous circulation 3) use the prediction and control pairing to improve 48h neurologically intact survival in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation, as compared to standard CPR techniques. Throughout this process, we will identify non-invasive alternative measurements to provide to the algorithms with the ultimate goal of proceeding with device development and human trials. Project Narrative In light of a growing body of evidence which suggests that prolonged duration CPR is a dynamic process, without universally optimal “one-size-fits-all” parameters, advanced methods of CPR individualization may be applied to optimize cardiac and cerebral perfusion for these patients. We propose to study the effects of machine learning and optimal control techniques within the context of CPR, thus creating a closed-loop CPR system that has been trained by pre-clinical data to modify CPR characteristics and optimize blood flow. Our preliminary studies suggest that machine learning and control algorithms can be successfully deployed in a preclinical model to adapt compression and decompression depth, increasing vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques. If our hypotheses are verified, a gateway for the first human trials is open.",Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation,10186125,R01HL157625,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Animal Experiments', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biofeedback', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood flow', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Choices and Control', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'E-learning', 'Early Mobilizations', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Shock', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'coronary perfusion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'pre-clinical', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'time interval']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,547699
"Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals Project Summary Bereaved individuals, especially those who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and those bereaved by suicide, have substantial risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. These vulnerable bereaved subgroups are also less likely to receive informal support or access mental health care, creating a pressing need to detect their suicide risk. Each year, well over a thousand unsolicited bereaved individuals visit our Cornell Center for Research on End-of-Life Care website and complete an online tool to determine if they meet criteria for PGD (over 6,000 completers to date). Compared to community-based bereaved samples, those who complete our online tool disproportionately meet criteria for PGD (e.g., ~30% vs. ~10%) and are suicide bereaved (~10% vs. ~2%). Thus, astoundingly, >35% of those who visit our Center website and complete our online diagnostic tool are at significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and/or attempts. To respond to the need to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among our bereaved website visitors, we propose to develop a web-based tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk. We will leverage our Living Memory Home, an online memorial application residing on our Center website, by enhancing its features to optimize data collection, including data on potential implicit indicators of a bereaved person's suicide attempt risk (Aim #1). Data will be gathered on 100 Living Memory Home users daily for a week, followed by a 1-week, 1- and 6-month post-baseline follow-up assessment. The study will generate ~30 texts/subject in the Living Memory Home's Imagined Dialogues with the deceased, and reflections, dreams, stories, and touchstones in Narrative Notes (~3,000 texts in total from all users). Boot-strapping resampling, natural language processing and machine learning techniques will then be applied to develop machine learning models predicting suicide attempt risk based on bereaved subjects' baseline, 1-week, 1- and 6-month Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores (Aim #2). Our primary outcome will be the 1-week CSSRS score. We will, thus, develop and then pilot test an automated way to detect bereaved persons'; suicide attempt risk based on their interactions with the Living Memory Home. This is a first step toward development of a safe, accurate, potentially scalable online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals. Project Narrative (Relevance) Bereaved individuals, and particularly those bereaved by suicide and who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder, are at substantially elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts. This project, applying machine learning techniques to detect suicidal attempt risk among bereaved individuals using an online bereavement resource, the Living Memory Home, is a first step in the development of a safe and effective online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals.",Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals,10077375,R21MH121886,"['Behavioral', 'Bereavement', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Grief reaction', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'United Kingdom', 'Visit', 'base', 'end of life care', 'expressive writing', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'help-seeking behavior', 'informal support', 'loved ones', 'metropolitan', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'skills', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide model', 'tool', 'web site', 'web-based tool']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2021,206083
"Leveraging Data Science and Informatics in an Automated Detection System of Surgical Errors Technological advancements continue to improve surgical outcomes. However, these technologies also introduce new challenges such as communication complexities, equipment troubleshooting under intense pressure, and higher cognitive demand on OR team members. In other words, surgery will continue to be risky despite technological improvements. There is evidence the number of avoidable complications may be underreported, that approximately 39% of in-hospital adverse events are surgical related, and that as many as 4,000 surgical never events (events which should not have occurred) happen in the US each year. The eventual goal of this research is to develop an automated detection system (ADS) of high- risk surgical states. The ADS will prevent surgical safety incidents before they occur through real-time monitoring and notification of appropriate operating room (OR) team members ahead- of-time if there is a looming risk. Thereby allowing the team to reconsider next steps and address the underlying issues, and hence reduce the rates of negative surgical outcomes. This project demonstrates the feasibility and merit of essential components for an ADS. Specifically, the surgical safety literature provides compelling evidence that surgical work-flow disruption (FD) sequences are informative indicators of error causation, therefore it is likely that a future ADS will model and monitor surgical state through tracking flow disruptions. Our current aims are to (1) finish implementation of the Research & Exploratory Analysis Driven Time-data Visualization (READ-TV) research tool; open-source software to visualize FD patterns and other longitudinal data. (2) Develop a stochastic model to predict whether high-risk, disruptive FD sequences will occur based on FD rates at earlier time points. (3) Link FD patterns and sequences with surgical outcomes by developing a text classifier to identify whether or not a surgical safety incident or near-miss occurred based on the associated EHR note. The classifier will be a deep learning model trained with tens of thousands of surgical EHR notes. The text analysis in the third aim will provide insight to FD types and sequences that are more error prone, thereby revealing the FD patterns that an ADS should warn an OR team to avoid. Additional benefits of this text analysis include a possible confirmation of the existence of incident underreporting. Upon completion of the 3 aims, we will have a computational foundation for an ADS: our research tool (aim 1: READ-TV visualization software) and analyses (aim 3: link flow disruptions to safety incidents through EHR note analysis) will advance interpretation of flow disruption (FD) sequences, and our stochastic models (aim 2: predict future surgical state from FD sequences) will prospectively predict error-prone states. This foundation can be extended in future projects through research in automatic transcription of flow disruptions, and the proper mode of alert delivery if the surgery is prone to enter an error-prone state. Surgery by nature is risky for the patient and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future despite technological advancements. The surgical safety literature provides compelling evidence that surgical work-flow disruption (FD) sequences are informative indicators of error causation, and we propose that an automated detection system (ADS) can detect if a surgery has an entered a high-risk state through monitoring of FD sequences, thereby alerting the OR team and preemptively preventing a safety incident. As the first steps for such a system: our research visualization tool (Aim 1) will advance interpretation and clustering of FD sequences, our text-based artificial intelligence models (Aim 3) will link FD patterns and surgery characteristics to safety incidents through computational analysis of over 150,000 surgical notes, and our stochastic models (Aim 2) will verify that a high-risk surgical state can be predicted ahead-of-time by monitoring disruption sequences.",Leveraging Data Science and Informatics in an Automated Detection System of Surgical Errors,10149122,F31LM013402,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Surgical Error', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'detection platform', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'robot assistance', 'surgery outcome', 'surgical risk', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,F31,2021,43491
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,10198898,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2021,130317
"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation.",Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation,10187566,R01EB028278,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Catheters', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Ensure', 'Esophageal Fistula', 'Family suidae', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Microbubbles', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'Navigation System', 'Necrotic Lesion', 'Ontario', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Radial', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'dexterity', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'novel', 'radio frequency', 'real time monitoring', 'robot assistance', 'therapy outcome', 'time use']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,379119
"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,10111519,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Flecks', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Low Prevalence', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Security', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'mental representation', 'programs', 'side effect', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'vigilance', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,441020
"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10353084,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Equipment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Information Systems', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vendor', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical care', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'design', 'encryption', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'point of care', 'smartphone Application', 'tool']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2021,40963
"Multimodal monitoring and high-dimensional data for episode prediction in bipolar disorder SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder with high recurrence and disability rates, high economic burden, and an estimated suicide risk 20 times higher than the general population. While efficacious treatment is available, BD patients spend a large proportion of their life symptomatic. Predicting the onset of episodes is a valuable strategy to decrease suicide and disability rates and to optimize healthcare costs. The overall objective of this (R21) Exploratory/Developmental study is to obtain pilot data to support the feasibility and potential value of a new approach to predict mood episodes in stable adult patients with BD. This proposal aims to develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time. To do so, we propose integrating multimodal, high-dimensional telemonitoring data, nonlinear techniques and artificial intelligence classification systems. This approach builds on our preliminary work on: (i) nonlinear techniques for the study of mood regulation in BD; (ii) an award-winning simulation using a machine learning technique (Markov Brains) for episode prediction in BD. AIMS: Aim 1 (feasibility): To obtain and integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels in 90 euthymic BD adults. Exploratory Aim 2 (potential value): To use machine learning techniques (Markov Brains) to distinguish participants at higher risk for a depressive or manic relapse based on their time-series and entropy levels (from Aim 1). HYPOTHESES: H1: We will be able to collect enough data in 80% of our participants and to integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels. H2: Markov Brains will identify participants at higher risk for a mood episode based on high (vs. low) auto-correlated time-series and low (vs. high) entropy levels. SIGNIFICANCE: This R21 application challenges more traditional prediction models by conceptualizing inter- and intra-individual variability as a dynamic property of biological systems. By leveraging densely-sampled objective and subjective data, autonomic, clinical and demographic data, this proposal aims to develop inference techniques that will examine changes within each individual, over time, in order to enhance the estimation performance. Ultimately, if we develop the capacity to predict mood episodes, we should be able to prevent them. NARRATIVE The proposed research is clinically relevant as it could develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time, in order to predict mood changes indicative of an imminent episode of illness in bipolar disorder.

"Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters PROJECT SUMMARY ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a small vessel vasculitis associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to reduced quality of life and excess mortality compared to the general population. In the context of improving rates of flare and mortality with contemporary treatments, increasing attention is shifting to complications (e.g., renal failure, infection, cardiovascular disease) as clinically-relevant and patient-oriented outcomes. However, our understanding of how best to address and prevent complications is limited because they are typically studied in isolation from a “single disease framework.” We do not understand how complications tend to co-occur in individuals in complication clusters. Moreover, with several available treatment options for AAV, comparative effectiveness studies using real-world experience data and relevant outcomes like complication clusters are needed to guide treatment decisions in a manner that personalizes care, improves quality of life, and reduces mortality. However, we do not have the methods to accurately and efficiently assemble an AAV cohort using state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage heterogeneous claims and electronic health record (EHR) data. The aims of this proposal are to (1) apply advanced clinical informatics methods (i.e., machine learning and natural language processing) to identify AAV cases in big data to assemble a large cohort and (2) determine complication clusters in an AAV cohort by applying latent transition analysis. To achieve these aims, we will leverage methodologic expertise developed through collaborations established during the PI’s K23 and use a novel data source that includes EHR data linked to Medicare and Medicaid claims. The PI’s team has previously demonstrated that unstructured (i.e., free-text) EHR data can be used to study topics mentioned in clinical notes of AAV patients and that keywords in these notes can help identify AAV patients but neither machine learning nor sophisticated natural language processing have been previously used to identify AAV cases. In addition, our prior work has examined AAV complications in isolation (e.g., renal disease, cardiovascular disease) but here we seek to identify phenotypes of complications (complication clusters) that tend to co-occur in patients, how patients transition between clusters over time, and what factors predict a person’s membership in a complication cluster. The major goal of this proposal is to build further preliminary data in preparation for an R01 application over the next 24 months. The planned R01 will focus on comparative effectiveness studies in AAV using cohorts assembled in big data and clinically-relevant, patient-oriented outcomes, like complication clusters. The results of these studies can then be used as inputs in simulation models built during my K23 to guide optimal patient-oriented treatment decisions. Ultimately, the goal of this research program is to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality by using data to inform personalized approaches to AAV treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite treatment advances, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) remains associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of death compared to the general population. To further improve these outcomes, we need to understand which medications work best to treat AAV and this requires a large group of patients to study and a better understanding of complications in AAV.

"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death. In this project, the applicant will apply numerical analysis and machine learning to detailed data acquired from patients undergoing therapy, to better define individual biological types of AF, which may provide a foundation for personalized patient-tailored diagnosis and therapy.",Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation,10130617,R01HL149134,"['Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dizziness', 'Drug Controls', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'voice recognition', 'voltage']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,771584
"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression. It will help personalize depression treatment by identifying patients who are failing treatments early and will assist providers to take necessary actions before patients drop out of treatment.",SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics ,10196980,R01MH119678,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Drops', 'Early treatment', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Health Technology', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'data de-identification', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'feature selection', 'global health', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2021,245551
"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10171903,R01HL153447,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Echocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'High Prevalence', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mission', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,779765
"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,10266337,U18TR003795,"['2019-nCoV', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 test', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhalation', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Flushing', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heating', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Materials Testing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Spectrometry', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'clinical care', 'detector', 'deviant', 'differential expression', 'disease transmission', 'graphical user interface', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'ion mobility', 'large scale production', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pandemic disease', 'portability', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U18,2021,975463
"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10271266,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high body mass index', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'obese person', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,360281
"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,10137788,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'structured data', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,176541
"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10215611,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound', 'underserved area']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2021,920184
"Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention. Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence. Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments, have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec- tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup- port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul- sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro- cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con- tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur- suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda- tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study. The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect students at elevated risk of school violence, and provide risk characteristics to assist prevention. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing an ARIA system will help establish a nationwide solution for detecting and preventing school violence.

"A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment  Unhealthy diet is strongly linked to risks of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and certain types of cancer. The Global Burden of Disease Study has found that, among the top 17 risk factors, poor diet is overwhelmingly the No. 1 risk factor for human diseases. Despite the strong connection between diet and health, unhealthy foods with large portion sizes are widely consumed. Currently, 68.5% of U.S. adults are overweight, among the highest in developed countries. The recent decline in U.S. life expectancy sent another alarming signal about the general health of the American people. Understanding how the diet-related risk factors affect people’s health and finding effective ways to empower them in improving lifestyle habits are among the most important tasks in public health. Unfortunately, dietary assessment in real-world settings has been exceedingly complex and inaccurate to implement. Technology is needed that allows researchers to assess dietary intake easily and accurately in real world settings so that effective intervention to manage obesity and related chronic diseases can be developed. We propose a biomedical engineering project to address the dietary assessment problem, taking advantage of advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence.  Our research team has been improving the ability to assess diet for over a decade. We have designed the eButton, a small wearable device pinned on clothes in front of the chest, capable of collecting image-based dietary data objectively and passively (i.e., without depending on subject’s self-report or volitional operation of the device). We have also developed algorithms to compute food volumes and nutrients from images. Since the eButton was developed, it has been used by many researchers in the U.S. and other countries for objective and passive diet-intake studies in both adults and children.  Despite the past successes, there have been two lingering critical problems associated with the objective and passive dietary assessment using wearable devices: 1) substantial manual efforts are required for researchers to visually examine image data to identify foods and estimate their volumes (portion sizes), and 2) there are privacy concerns about researchers’ viewing of participants’ real-life images. Although solving these problems could enable the eButton and other wearable devices for large-scale diet-intake studies, we were not able to find effective solutions until recently when Artificial intelligence (AI) emerged. Advanced AI systems, especially those based on deep learning, can be trained by large amounts of labeled data to produce results comparable or even superior to those produced by human in numerous fields of applications. AI technology is also a powerful tool for dietary assessment, potentially providing an ideal solution to the two previously mentioned problems. We thus propose to develop a human-mimetic AI system to recognize foods from images, estimate portion sizes, and find energy and nutrient values from a database in a fully automatic process. Using the AI approach, there will be no need for researchers to view participants’ real-life images, and the AI system well-respects individuals’ privacy because it is trained to recognizes human foods only, nothing else.  Currently, the performances of existing AI systems are limited by the extensive variety and high variability of human foods, insufficient training data, and difficulty in finding appropriate nutritional information from food databases. In this application, we propose a new strategy to personalize the AI system for each research participant using an advanced mathematical model of personal food choices. With this personalization step, the dimensionality of our envisioned AI system can be reduced drastically, and our goal of automatic, objective and passive dietary assessment can be reached realistically. We also propose to improve the electronic hardware and develop a biomimetic camera to enlarge the field of view for the eButton. Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation of the personalized AI system in real-world settings using human subjects. This research aims to apply advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence to evaluate individual’s energy and nutrient intake automatically and objectively.","A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment",10111099,R01DK127310,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Food Energy', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Label', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Science', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'Update', 'Volition', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer type', 'computerized data processing', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dietary', 'effective intervention', 'field study', 'good diet', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'improved', 'infancy', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mimetics', 'neural network', 'obesity management', 'operation', 'overweight adults', 'robotic system', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,657303
"Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment Abstract Seventy percent of American adults are overweight or obese, presenting an unprecedented challenge to the nation’s health systems. Effective behavioral programs exist, but these programs are intensive, long-term and require highly-trained clinicians, making them prohibitively expensive and thus limiting disseminability. Approaches to decreasing costs include replacing highly-trained clinicians with paraprofessionals, reducing contact frequency, and/or automating intervention. However, although these alternative interventions result in considerably lower average weight losses, variability of weight loss is high. Specifically, and consistent with a Supportive Accountability Model, a substantial minority of participants in high-intensity interventions receive no benefit, while a subset of those receiving low-intensity interventions achieve clinically significant weight loss. An ideal weight loss treatment system would enhance outcomes and reduce costs by matching each participant to the intervention he/she needs, thus adapting to participants’ needs and conserving resources where they are not needed. Stepped care represents one such system, but has had mixed success and suffers from a number of shortcomings. The innovative artificial intelligence (AI) strategy of reinforcement learning (RL) provides rapidly and repeatedly-varying features of intervention, continuously ""learning"" which features provide optimal responses for which participants. Our team recently completed a pilot of an AI weight loss system in which overweight adults received a brief in-person weight loss intervention and then were randomly assigned to receive 3 months of non-optimized interventions (i.e., 12-minute phone calls) or an optimized combination of phone calls, text exchanges, and automated messages, selected based on each participants’ response to each intervention as determined by weight and behavioral data. As hypothesized, we achieved equivalent weight losses at a fraction of the time cost. The proposed study would recruit 320 overweight adults, provide 1 month of group-based behavioral weight loss treatment and then randomize participants to either continue to receive group-based behavioral weight loss in a remote format for 11 months (BWL-S) or to reinforcement learning-based treatment (BWL-AI). In line with our Supportive Accountability model, BWL-AI would vary modality, intensity and counselor skill based on continuously-monitored participant digital data. The proposed study--the first of its kind--would expand on our pilot in several ways including sample size, duration, and features of intervention selected by the AI system. Aims of this project are to test the hypotheses that weight loss outcomes in BWL-AI will be equivalent to or better than BWL-S, and that the cost per participant and per kg of lost weight will be less in BWL-AI than in BWL-S. Other include characterizing the AI system (in terms of interventions selected), assessing feasibility and acceptability of the refined AI system, evaluating psychological and demographic predictors of AI intervention selection and investigating differences between responders and non-responders in how the AI system allocates resources. Project Narrative The obesity epidemic presents an unprecedented challenge to the nation’s health systems, and existing gold standard behavioral weight loss treatments are highly expensive to implement due to their intensive, long-term nature and the highly trained clinicians required to deliver treatment. Approaches to decreasing costs (e.g., low intensity treatments, coaching by paraprofessionals rather than experts) have been implemented with moderate success, but weight losses are not consistent across different cost-saving approaches, suggesting that individuals may be best served when they are matched to the type of treatment they need, and when the resources matched to individuals are continuously adapted as their needs change. The primary goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that continuously adjusts features of weight loss coaching including modality and coach skill level.",Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment,10210830,R01DK125641,"['Accelerometer', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Binge Eating', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cost Savings', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insurance', 'Intake', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Minority', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'care systems', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'cost effective treatment', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning progression', 'medication compliance', 'overweight adults', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'remote delivery', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment responders', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,634165
"Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery Abstract While virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation technology is being developed to improve laparoscopic surgical training outside the operating room (OR), existing simulators focus mostly on technical skills (TS) of hand-eye coordination for isolated tasks and seldom on non-technical skills (NTS) associated with both cognitive skills of decision making, as well as interpersonal skills of communication, team-work and conflict resolution. To enable VR-based surgical simulators to also train for cognitive skills, in the previous grant period we successfully developed the next generation (Gen2) of laparoscopic surgical simulators that immerse the trainee in a virtual OR using a head-mounted display (HMD) system, and introduce distractions, interruptions and other stressors to capture the high-stress environment of the real OR. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no VR-based simulator for training interpersonal skills needed for the multidisciplinary integration of OR teams, which consist of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and perioperative nurses. Following the significant reduction of adverse events in other disciplines, such as aviation, by the introduction of mandatory simulation-based team training (e.g., crew resource management), the National Surgical Skills Curriculum developed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) has prescribed ten team-based training modules to be performed in a simulation facility (e.g., an OR endosuite) with scenario-based training on high- fidelity manikin simulators. However, such facility-based team training is extremely expensive and cumbersome, requires dedicated facility and faculty time, and entails significant planning and schedule coordination between trainees, technicians, and faculty. To overcome the challenges of facility-based OR team training, the goal of this project is to extend the immersive VR technology (Gen2) developed as part of our prior grant for a single user to the entire OR team, and harness recent advances in cloud computing, mobile device-based VR and artificial intelligence and machine learning to design, develop and evaluate a Virtual Operating Room Team Experience (VORTeX) simulation system. The VORTeX will allow the OR team to train together in a distributed fashion (i.e., not co-located in the same room or simulation facility) wearing mobile device-based HMD systems to develop further their NTS based on computer-generated simulation scenarios replacing the physical ones. Evaluation of the simulation scenarios will be performed asynchronously by a team of experts based on post-action replays. We will implement the VORTeX for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy crisis scenario, developed and validated by our Co-I Dr. Dan Jones at BIDMC and adopted as one of the team training modules of the ACS/APDS national surgical skills curriculum. We hypothesize that the VORTeX will be at least as good as or better than traditional facility-based simulation in providing non-technical skills training to OR teams. Project Narrative: The goal of this research is to develop and validate a comprehensive computer-based technology that will allow surgical trainees to practice their surgical skills on computer-based models. Surgical procedures and techniques, learnt and perfected in this risk-free manner before application to patients, will translate to fewer operating room errors, reduced patient morbidity and improved patient outcomes resulting in faster healing, shorter hospital stay and reduced post surgical complications and treatment costs.",Physically Realistic Virtual Surgery,10296166,R01EB005807,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Aviation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Board Certification', 'Boston', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Floor', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Internet', 'Interruption', 'Israel', 'Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Medical center', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative Nursing', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Software Framework', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cognitive skill', 'cognitive training', 'computer generated', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'distraction', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'eye hand coordination', 'handheld mobile device', 'head mounted display', 'healing', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interactive computing', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation environment', 'skills', 'skills training', 'stressor', 'success', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'virtual patient', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual surgery']",NIBIB,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,654073
"ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, 5.7 million people live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Two-thirds of individuals with ADRD live at home and as a result, approximately 15 million unpaid care partners, mostly family members, are increasingly required to perform complex tasks which causes them significant stress. The major contributors to care partners’ stress are: 1) having low confidence in their competency in their caregiving tasks, such as managing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and behavioral symptoms of ADRD as they change over the course of the disease and 2) being socially isolated with feelings of loneliness. Benten proposes to address these problems through creation of the Avatar Companion to Improve the Lives of Informal care partners of individuals with Alzheimer’s (ACILIA), a home kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities (i.e., emotion analysis, sentiment analysis and life-long machine learning [L3] algorithm), with home speakers, a smart watch, and mobile app, to support the CPs on the care journey. ACILIA will provide just-in--time guidance and support to care partners in addition to stage- appropriate education and training on how to manage caregiving tasks. It will also engage in natural conversations with the care partners detecting sentiments of stress and offering advice and support and connection to a virtual community. ACILIA aims to assist in reducing the family care partners’ stress levels by improving their competency and capabilities in providing care and by providing companionship and support, which will reflect positively on their quality of life and that of their loved ones living with ADRD and aging in place. During this Phase I project, we will develop of a prototype ACILIA using input from an advisory board of informal care partners and people living with ADRD. We will also conduct a pilot test for feasibility of ACILIA among 20 individuals who are in early-middle stage ADRD and their informal care partners to evaluate the usability and acceptance of ACILIA prototype. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to Phase II and evaluating its outcomes. improving informal care partners’ competency, reducing their feeling of loneliness, and reducing their stress levels in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). PROJECT NARRATIVE User-centered design and pilot testing conducted for the Phase 1 development of ACILIA will make it possible to evaluate the feasibility of ACILIA to support informal care partners of PLWAD in their care efforts. In the long-term, Benten envisions ACILIA becoming a valuable tool for informal care partners, enabling them to perform their caregiving tasks more effectively by delivering just-in-time stage-appropriate training and stress- reduction support, and offering companionship throughout the journey of providing dementia care.",ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support,10250533,R43AG069659,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anger', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Frustration', 'Home environment', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'United States', 'Universities', 'aging in place', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal support', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'loved ones', 'member', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'online community', 'prototype', 'smart watch', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,"BENTEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2021,196867
"Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing. Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under- captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.  A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.  The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention. Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most. Project Narrative  Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and 10-25 times the number that die contemplate suicide every year. Large gaps remain in our understanding of genetic risk factors of suicidal ideation and attempt as well as genetic and clinical risk factors that contribute to transition from ideation to attempt. This investigation will use natural language processing, machine learning, electronic health records for over 1 million people, and two major biobanks from the United States and the United Kingdom to study the clinical and genetic risk factors necessary to improve identification of patients at highest risk of suicidal behaviors.",Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention,10061648,R01MH121455,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family Study', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'risk stratification', 'structured data', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'trait']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,543736
"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,10213130,R01HL148248,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical conference', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'heart disease risk', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolic stroke']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,673978
"Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation (ER) is a key transdiagnostic process and treatment target, with particular relevance to distress disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder). Distress disorders, which are characterized by heightened negative emotions, are prevalent conditions with considerable public health burden and comparatively lower response to treatment. The efficacy of interventions for distress disorders may be improved by investigating components of effective ER, both as instructed in the lab (ER capacity) and as measured naturalistically in daily life (ER tendency). Effective ER is based on key components such as accurate perceptions of one's emotions (i.e., emotional awareness) as well sensitivity to the environmental context (i.e., contextual sensitivity), which facilitate the selection and implementation of the appropriate ER strategy. For individuals with distress disorders, elevated levels of perseverative negative thinking (PNT) interferes with these processes, contributing to ER deficits and increased symptoms. This contextualized and integrative model of ER in distress disorders has not been tested, and very little is known about the predictors or outcomes of effective ER tendency—a critical gap given that ER capacity is irrelevant if ER is not employed skillfully in daily life. Furthermore, examinations of ER tendency can show how individuals, considering their particular characteristics and abilities, can optimally match particular ER strategies to the specific situations they encounter. The goal of this application is to evaluate components of ineffective ER— both in the lab and in daily life— that influence the severity and course of distress disorders and functioning. Consistent with NIMH strategic objectives and the RDoC framework, this project incorporates multimodal assessment, dimensional symptom measurement, and machine learning approaches. The proposed study will be comprised of 300 adults, oversampled for elevated PNT (50%). Participants will complete a lab assessment to measure predictors of ER capacity, followed by a 10- day ecological momentary assessment study examining predictors of ER tendency in daily life. To better capture negative emotions as they occur, reports in daily life will be physiologically-triggered with algorithms that detect potential episodes of psychological stress. Effective ER will be operationalized in multiple ways in the lab and in daily life, using self-reported changes in affect, physiological indices, and perceived ER success. Effective ER capacity and tendency will then be examined as predictors of distress symptom, functioning, and well-being trajectories assessed monthly for 12 months. Additionally, an exploratory aim is to create predictive models from a multifaceted battery of theoretically motivated variables that impact ER tendency and subsequent clinical outcomes. To this end, machine learning will be used to build a clinically-relevant framework for how person- level, situation-level, and ER strategy use interact to predict optimal ER. Overall, this project contributes to the long-term goal of identifying and refining targets for personalized interventions, by more precisely isolating key mechanisms of effective ER for specific individuals and the contexts they encounter in their daily lives. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine predictors (i.e., emotional awareness, contextual sensitivity, perseverative negative thinking) of dysfunctional emotion regulation that contribute to depression and anxiety, as well as to provide an initial framework for optimal emotion regulation in individualized daily life contexts. This study uses multiple measurements (behavioral, psychophysiological, self-report, clinical interview) in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings in daily life, and it focuses on dimensional and transdiagnostic features that underlie multiple disorders. Consistent with NIMH's mission, findings will be relevant to public health because they can help refine intervention targets and inform personalized treatment for depression and anxiety, which are common and impairing conditions.",Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life,10162664,R01MH118218,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Applications Grants', 'Arousal', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'comparative', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'random forest', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2021,428695
"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases. PROJECT SUMMARY Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. The rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNOW proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNOW is developing the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms to guide any non-trained people to correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving the management of chronic diseases. In Phase I, we validated the feasibility of our product by developing a module for heart stethoscope exams. Users were able to autonomously take a phonocardiogram measurement in <8 seconds, while the system verified the correct use of the device. In this Phase II project, the additional modules required for a minimum viable product (MVP) with significant clinical and commercial impact will be developed. This will include modules for Respiratory Auscultation, Otoscopic Ear Examination, Mouth Examination, and temperature control. The developed modules will be then integrated within the current front-end structure. The MVP will be validated in a clinical setting, where its usability, benefits, and clinical effectiveness will be assessed. Additionally, the platform will be integrated with major providers of Electronic Health Records. At the end of this SBIR Phase II project, an MVP ready to enter the market will have been fully developed. Future R&D efforts of AdviNOW Medical will be aimed at the development of Artificial Intelligence based diagnosis of abnormal medical conditions from self-measured biometric parameters. The mission of AdviNOW Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class II medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions.

"Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room Visits (SPACER) PROJECT ABSTRACT Asthma impacts more than 25 million adults and children in the U.S. with high associated morbidity and socioeconomic disparities in outcomes. Because effective medications are available to treat and prevent exacerbations of asthma and evidence-based interventions exist to mitigate the impact of harmful socioeconomic factors, early identification of those at highest risk is crucial. However, efforts to predict future exacerbations of asthma have yielded modest results with infrequent inclusion of comprehensive information on social hardships, such as food insecurity and housing instability, or financial hardships, such as difficulty affording the costs of controller medications which is particularly relevant for those with private health insurance. Identifying social and financial hardships requires broad-based screenings which are resource intensive, difficult to implement in clinical settings and often incomplete or limited to care seeking populations. Further, few asthma risk prediction modalities incorporate time-variable (temporal) data on important social, clinical, and environmental factors. Machine learning, an advanced computational approach to risk prediction, has great potential to improve upon conventional approaches to risk prediction of asthma exacerbations through indirect estimation of social hardships and inclusion of temporal risk factors. Implementation of enhanced asthma risk-prediction models in a health plan setting offers distinct advantages due to existing investments in asthma care management and access to timely claims data across the full care continuum. Accordingly, the aims of the SPACER study (Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room visits) are 1) To describe social and financial hardships in privately insured adults and children with asthma, and association with medication adherence and exacerbations, 2) To indirectly estimate self-reported social and financial hardships using routinely collected health plan and spatial data, and 3) To develop and validate a machine learning network model, incorporating temporal sociomarker, clinical, and environmental data, to predict asthma exacerbations in a health plan setting. The research leverages the unique research environment of the Department of Population Medicine, an academic research department of Harvard Medical School, situated in a regional non-profit health plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The mentored career development award will support Dr. Alon Peltz, a physician and health services researcher, in developing expertise in machine learning modeling and use of social data to improve prediction of adverse clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new methods for asthma risk prediction in a health plan setting by incorporating social and financial hardship data, temporal features, and machine learning. Applications of this research will directly enable U.S. health plans to better identify adults and children for enrollment in asthma care management programs in order to moderate their combined clinical and social risks for poor asthma quality.

"Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home Abstract Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause for both hospitalizations and readmissions in the Medicare program. HF’s high mortality rate and high hospitalization utilization rate via readmissions results in a large economic burden currently estimated at over $30B, and prevalence of HF is expected to continue rising by 46% by 2030. There is an opportunity to deploy remote patient monitoring (RPM) tools for measuring prognostic biomarkers of worsening HF and acute decompensation and hospital readmission. Bender Tech (BT) has developed a urine testing platform capable of easily attaching to a home-toilet for accurate and easy collection of longitudinal health and behavior data without the requirement of manual sample collection and/or testing. We propose to adapt our system for use in elderly HF patient populations by rendering data collection and transmission completely passive. We propose to integrate sensors and firmware capable of identifying when a user has used their home toilet (Specific Aim 1), develop the machine learning (ML) classification algorithms necessary for determining when to perform a testing sequence (Specific Aim 2), and use ML methods to demonstrate feasibility of user biometric identification via urinary testing data (Specific Aim 3). A successful outcome of this proposal will be a set of classification models built using ML techniques designed to enable passive collection of longitudinal urine profile data from a home-toilet for use in remotely managing elderly HF patients. This will ready the product for prospective clinical trials that would be the subject of a future phase II submission for use in remotely monitoring diuretic effectiveness and preventing hospital readmissions. Project Narrative Remotely stratifying risk of worsening heart failure and predicting imminent decompensation and hospitalizations using remote patient monitoring devices can help lower healthcare costs and improve lives for the elderly living with heart failure at home. Longitudinal urinary trend data of physiologically important markers, such as spot sodium tests, have been shown to help classify potentially stable heart failure patients, predict acute decompensation, and measure diuretic effectiveness via relative changes from baseline measurements. Bender Tech proposes to integrate the hardware and machine learning methods necessary to render its internet- connected home urine testing platform completely passive to enable use by the elderly HF population and obviate any need for device interaction for data collection and transmission.","Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home",10187779,R43HL157937,"['Acute', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Defecation', 'Devices', 'Diuretics', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Sodium', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'Urination', 'Urine', 'Use Effectiveness', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'health data', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk stratification', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tool', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning', 'urinary']",NHLBI,"BENDER TECH, LLC",R43,2021,224996
"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,10116356,R21DA050761,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physical Education', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'data resource', 'digital', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'payment', 'peer', 'satisfaction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'urgent care', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2021,202917
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",10199784,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'postoperative recovery', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2021,100000

We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",10199784,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'postoperative recovery', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2021,650022
"Development of a reminiscence therapy online platform with machine learning to increase engagement with people living with dementia and their care partners PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementias, and the number of affected individuals is rapidly growing. Symptoms include impaired cognition, resulting in difficulty in performing daily activities and consequent functional dependence on others. The progressive nature of AD and ADRD can result in increasing degrees of care required from professional and family caregivers. Non- pharmacologic interventions positively influence cognition, mood, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and one well-established intervention, life story work (the use of written and oral life histories), serves as an effective technique that can elicit conversation and memories in those with AD and ADRD. However, generating useful life story materials is a time-consuming task for caregivers. To overcome this barrier, LifeBio Inc. is developing a reminiscence therapy platform —LifeBio MemoryTM— with a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories to serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia and their family and caregivers. The LifeBio MemoryTM platform application will elicit and store individuals’ stories, photos, and videos and ultimately deliver personalized, point-of-care reminiscence therapy exercises for patients. In preliminary work supporting this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Inc. partnered with the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging to conduct a pilot study in nursing homes, which showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms among participants in LifeBio Inc.’s intervention and revealed that the majority of participants considered knowledge of their life story to be important for caregivers, while caregivers also reported positive experiences in relation to the impact of the intervention on caregiving. In this project we will: 1) Develop prototype enhancements of the existing LifeBio program and conduct focus group evaluations of these prototypes with 12 existing or former LifeBio users, 20 dementia care professionals familiar with LifeBio and 6 older adults with early-stage dementia to help maintain person-centered practices throughout the research process; 2) Finalize the LifeBio Memory product, which will include the development of a system to automatically record and process individuals’ life stories. 3) Conduct a full-scale fidelity trial of the complete package with 40 care professionals and 160 dementia care dyads across within an assisted living setting. The product of this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Memory™, will be a novel, scalable, and easily implemented solution through which caregivers and healthcare providers can offer person-centered care to people living with AD and AD-related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Non-pharmacological interventions and person-centered care strategies are important elements of care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Life story work, which uses written and oral life histories to elicit conversation and memories, is an effective intervention for individuals with dementia; however, because of the time-consuming nature of generating useful life story materials, has not been widely implemented in nursing homes and other care environments.

"Patient specific 3D printed tissue engineered vascular graft for aortic reconstruction designed by artificial intelligence algorithm. 1 The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered  2 vascular grafts (TEVG) for use in aortic arch repair surgery. These TEVGs are optimized for high pressure  3 circulation using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence, and will grow with the patient, in hopes of  4 obviating need for future surgeries to replace grafts, which can occur with contemporary arch reconstruction  5 materials. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death due to congenital anomalies. Despite  6 significant advances in surgical management for CHD, one significant source of morbidity and mortality arises  7 from the complexity of surgery for diverse anatomies in the aortic arch. Previous studies have demonstrated  8 that the resultant arch geometry after surgical reconstruction of stenotic or hypoplastic aortas is important to  9 minimize reduce energy loss and undesirable flow inside the arch, which can lead to hypertension, abnormal 10 vascular response and ventricular dysfunction. Ensuring a patient-specific graft design for ideal reconstructed 11 route before surgery with minimum energy loss and wall shear stress may yield long-term benefits for patient 12 health and quality of life. 13 We have demonstrated native vessel like neotissue formation of TEVG in small and large animal 14 studies. Based on these experiences, we have developed a novel 3D printing technology combining 3D printed 15 metal mandrels with nanofiber electro-spun technology. With this 3D printing technology, we showed that 16 TEVG developed native like neovessel formation in venous circulation in a sheep model. For this next step, we 17 aim to develop grafts in arterial circulation that can be applied to aortic reconstruction. We will also develop 18 automatic design algorithms to design optimal graft shape in order to reduce time and cost of patient specific 19 design. We hypothesize that patient-specific TEVG using our 3D printing technology can be designed, 20 aided by pre-operative imaging and flow data, computer assisted design (CAD), automatic design 21 algorithms based on computation fluid dynamics (CFD) results, and will demonstrate proper neotissue 22 formation and growth while maintaining optimally designed hemodynamics. 23 This project will be an important step towards clinical application of patient-specific vascular grafts that 24 recapitulate the native anatomy and mechanical properties. The results of this work will have a broader impact 25 on the design and fabrication of other more complex cardiovascular structures for implantation. This paradigm 26 shift in vascular graft technology will improve the quality and safety of pediatric patient care. The goal of this study is to create patient-specific, hemodynamically optimized, tissue engineered vascular grafts using 3D printing technology and artificial intelligence for use in aortic arch repair surgery which demands a structured surgical approach in order to optimize hemodynamics postoperatively. We will optimize the design of an aortic graft automatically using computational flow dynamics, refine 3D printing manufacturing, evaluate grafts with in-vitro testing, and finally will test the performance of the grafts in vivo over time.

"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",10129958,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'statistical learning', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350335
"Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging. Abstract This project will optimize a point-of-care (POC) platelet force monitoring technology for clinical application in trauma care. The leading causes of death and disability after trauma are related to hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Platelets are critical to hemostasis by inducing clot formation via adhesion, aggregation, and contraction at wounds. Platelets often become dysfunctional after trauma which worsens internal bleeding and ICH progression and increasing morbidity. POC platelet assays have not been incorporated in practice due to:1) lack of large cohort ED patient testing; 2) poor accuracy in transfusion prediction and 3) extended processing times. We have made an innovative POC technology to test platelet function by directly measuring platelet contractile forces on microfluidic force sensors. Advantages of our POC test vs. existing assays: 1) rapid, direct activation and measures of platelet functions and 2) innovative machine vision with deep potential for machine learning insight. However, this technology needs optimization and validation in a large major ED trauma cohort and remains untested after ICH. Our pilot data suggests platelet contractile forces are sensitive to a range of relevant activation pathways and mechanisms and force is significantly decreased in trauma patients requiring blood transfusion. Further, in prior clinical trials, platelet transfusion has been found to be harmful when used indiscriminately. Building on this unmet scientific need, we will determine if our POC technology is predictive of hemorrhagic complications in trauma patients, informing a personalized transfusion strategy. Our overarching hypothesis is our POC platelet force monitor technology is an efficient indicator of bleeding complications after trauma and ICH. Aim 1: Optimize the platelet force monitor optics to improve platelet force sensor performance. We hypothesize the addition of a second fluorescent imaging channel can improve our current platelet force sensor performance. Aim 2: Use machine learning (ML) image analysis to improve detection of platelet dysfunction and prediction of trauma outcomes. We hypothesize image-based ML models can improve test performance. We will compare the accuracy of direct platelet force measurements (Aim 1) vs. ML-enhancement measurements for detecting platelet dysfunction and predicting outcomes. Aim 3: Validate our platelet function algorithm for predicting blood transfusion needs, mortality, and the progression of traumatic ICH in a prospective cohort of severely-injured ED trauma patients. We hypothesize platelet force will be a powerful predictor of blood transfusion needs, mortality, and progression of ICH. In the ED we will apply our algorithm (both the original and optimized algorithm from Aim 1) to blood from trauma patients and compare the predicted transfusion requirements against actual transfusion (Aim-3a) and measure the association between measured platelet force and ICH progression (Aim-3b). Project Narrative Rapidly identifying patients who are at risk for traumatic internal and intracranial bleeding would improve care by enabling personalized transfusion strategies. The current clinical approach causes undue morbidity and mortality because of late identification of those in need of a transfusion, resulting in delayed blood transfusion in those patients who would benefit, and unnecessary transfusions in those who would not. The proposed project improves and validates an innovative blood testing technology which has shown the potential to make rapid bleeding assessment of every patient both easy and accurate.",Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging.,10146213,R61HL156508,"['ADP Receptors', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Care Technology Points', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Electrons', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Prospective cohort', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'blood product', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'fluorescence imaging', 'force sensor', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'microsensor', 'mortality', 'nanonewton', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'platelet function', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'seal', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'shear stress', 'trauma care', 'wound']",NHLBI,STASYS MEDICAL CORPORATION,R61,2021,294185
"A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data SUMMARY: A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict AAA Prognosis  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the aorta. If left untreated AAA may go on to rupture, an occurrence which has a 90% mortality rate and is the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 15,000 annual deaths reported annually. After AAA is diagnosed, a clinician must determine its severity; i.e., the relative risk of rupture compared to the risk of intervention. Current clinical guidelines for this determination is based on the one-size-fits-all “maximum diameter criterion”, which states that when a AAA reaches 5.5 cm in diameter, the risk of rupture necessitates repair of the aneurysm. However, smaller sized AAAs (< 5.5 cm) have been seen to rupture at rates of up to 23.4%, demonstrating that this diameter-based criterion is unsuitable for AAA management. A recently completed NIH-funded clinical trial, 1U01-AG037120: “Non-Invasive Treatment of AAA Clinical Trial” (N-TA3CT) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment of small AAA. During this trial, a highly unique and valuable dataset was collected longitudinally every 6 months for a 3-year period for patients presenting with small AAA.  This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that, at the time of discovery of small AAA, clinical prognosis – i.e., predicting if and when clinical intervention will be required based on rupture risk metrics – can be facilitated using machine learning-based algorithms using real-time biomechanical, morphological, and clinical data. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims.  Aim 1 will be to quantify the “evolution” of individual small AAA from the N-TA3CT trial. The biomechanical and morphological status of all patient AAAs at each timepoint will be determined from data collected during the trial using finite element analysis and morphometric analysis, respectively, and these will be tabulated along with clinical indices for each AAA at each timepoint.  Aim 2 will be to develop and validate machine learning and regression techniques to forecast the clinical prognosis of small AAA. The data from Aim 1 as well as follow-up reporting data from the N- TA3CT trial will be used to train machine learning classification models to determine whether aneurysm prognosis can be accurately predicted. Validation will be performed on a subset of data to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity of the proposed prediction model.  The unique dataset from the N-TA3CT trial, paired with the extensive experience of and methods developed by our lab, will allow us, for the first time, to carefully examine and quantify the natural evolution of small AAA and to subsequently develop a predictive model to improve patient prognosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, when clinicians must decide if or when to fix an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; characterized by the ballooning of a thin and weakened wall), they base their decision solely on the AAA diameter. However, a quarter of AAA below the accepted cutoff diameter still rupture, often leading to death. In this project, we will use a unique database collected during a clinical trial of small AAA, computer models, and machine learning to create a new decision method that will better serve patients with this disease.",A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data,10115365,R21HL156246,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Annual Reports', 'Aorta', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilatation - action', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'rate of change', 'repaired', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,117375
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10200790,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'risk prediction']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,506211
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,10219347,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2021,118570
"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability.

"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,10165813,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'risk prediction']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,684863
"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aneurysm', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Catheters', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Spasm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonist', 'Enrollment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Nimodipine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevention', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Survivors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thrombosis', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vasospasm', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'care costs', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'spreading depression', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment trial', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385
"Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership. The MOLAR solution aims to fully account for interfraction variations, thereby substantially improving the accuracy and effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) for cancer.

"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques to identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior using large-scale integrated clinical data.","Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data",10116483,R01MH119177,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Data', 'Death Certificates', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Services', 'Site', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'demographics', 'detection method', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'implementation study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'model design', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric emergency', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'validation studies']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,686186
"Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes Project Summary  Torsades de Pointes, a lethal ventricular arrhythmia, is a side effect of several commonly used antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, antipsychotics, antihistamines and other ‘non-cardiovascular’ therapies. Though this adverse event is rare, it can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. The ignorance about the underlying differences between those at high risk versus low risk of forming this drug-induced arrhythmia halts any considerable progress in preventing it. Rather than simply removing these drugs from the market, a closer examination of the physiological and clinical traits of patients who benefited from the treatment and those who formed the arrhythmia needs to be performed. This highlights the idea of precision medicine and the importance of identifying relevant sub-groups of patients likely to benefit from a treatment versus those who are highly susceptible to a drug-induced adverse event. The current standards for predicting risk, a lengthened action potential (AP) duration of cells and a prolonged QT interval on an echocardiogram (ECG) have proven ineffective. Thus, there is a need to extract pertinent information from the cellular and tissue levels before administration of the therapeutic to detect patterns only apparent in the high-risk population. To analyze this concept, I plan to (1) explain at a mechanistic level the differences between the healthy and at-risk patients, (2) identify important AP and ECG signatures that can predict risk early on, and (3) connect the physiological and clinical findings to improve the profile and description of the high-risk population. I will combine two complementary computational techniques: (1) simulations with mechanistic quantitative systems pharmacology models of heart cells and tissues; and (2) advanced machine learning approaches that can identify hidden patterns. Thus, this project aims to develop an algorithm which will improve risk prediction and upgrade the current imperfect and unreliable standards for prescribing proarrhythmic therapies. Project Narrative Current standards for identifying patients at risk of forming the rare but lethal ventricular tachycardia, Drug- induced Torsades de Pointes include measuring the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although this decently predicts susceptibility, there remains a percentage of patients who still succumb to an arrhythmia with a normal QT. To improve patient risk stratification, this research project aims to develop an algorithm that can unmask subtle precursors at both the physiological and clinical levels, classify high risk patients, and upgrade the current imperfect standards for prescribing these therapies.",Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes,10082298,F31HL149358,"['Action Potentials', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihistamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Factors', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle Cells', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Torsades de Pointes', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'complex data', 'delayed rectifier potassium channel', 'drug market', 'efficacious treatment', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'responders and non-responders', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'sudden cardiac death', 'supervised learning', 'trait']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2021,44436
"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,10299634,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,H.

"Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Critically injured patients have a four-fold higher risk of death from medical errors than other hospitalized patients, with nearly half of preventable deaths related to errors during the initial resuscitation phase. Although protocols, simulation, and leadership training improve team performance in this setting, as many as 12 protocol deviations per resuscitation have been observed, even with experienced teams. Given adverse outcomes that can result from performance gaps, there is a critical need to establish novel approaches for applying real-time decision support in critical-care settings. The long-term goal is to implement decision support for trauma resuscitation and other fast-paced, high-risk critical care settings that improves performance, reduces errors, and prevents adverse outcomes. The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically advance what was achieved during the first funding period by designing, implementing and testing an intention-aware recommender system that (1) recognizes and tracks current goals using sensor data, the output from patient monitors, and data captured from digital devices, (2) derives recommendations that support adherence to goal- based protocols, and (3) displays these recommendations in real time on wall displays. The central hypothesis is that decision support aligning with intentions (“intended” or “current” goals) will enhance protocol compliance, leading to improved outcomes related to trauma resuscitation. The rationale for this renewal is that recommendations supporting protocol compliance that are aligned with team intentions are more likely to be adopted by being less distracting and associated with lower cognitive load. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) design and implement an automated real- time approach for predicting and monitoring the assessment and treatment goals of trauma resuscitation; and 2) generate and display a recommended plan of activities that supports current goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. For the first Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied for recognizing goals using data obtained from sensors and other digital data sources. Under the second Aim, a machine learning strategy will be implemented and tested that generates recommendations responsive to team intentions. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on development of real-time methods that integrate goals as an input for making recommendations that meet the most current and relevant information needs. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the care of severely injured and other critically ill patients by promoting timely and appropriate achievement of critical assessment and treatment goals in settings that remain at high-risk for medical errors. The results of this research continuum are expected to have an important positive impact on the outcome by addressing the mismatch between complex decision-making and human vulnerability to error that remain in critical care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because it focuses on the design and implementation of a novel real-time decision support system that will reduce errors associated with adverse patient outcomes by providing recommendations that support the current information needs of multidisciplinary trauma teams. The proposed project is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission related to development of biomedical communications systems, methods, and technologies, and information dissemination and utilization among health professionals.",Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes,10163257,R01LM011834,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Information Dissemination', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'simulation', 'success']",NLM,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,654500
"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,10088470,K08HL150291,"['Adult', 'American', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement transplantation network', 'post-transplant', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'skills', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2021,157896
"Optical Coherence Elastography of the Cornea PROJECT SUMMARY The fundamental physical properties of the outer tunic of the eye determine the structural characteristics of the ocular globe and may be altered in several devastating disease states including axial elongation in myopia, pathological deformation in keratoconus, and iatrogenic keratoectasia following corneal refractive surgery. These biomechanical tissue characteristics not only influence our clinical interpretation of diagnostic tests, e.g. measurement of intraocular pressure, but have been implicated as important factors in the development of glaucoma. Currently, there is no available reliable method to perform quantitative measurement of corneal elasticity in vivo. Here we will develop novel method for the assessment of corneal elastic properties that could potentially be used for routine clinical diagnostic and treatment. This method will take advantages of highly localized air pressure stimulation and ultra-sensitive detection and analysis of the pressure waves propagation on corneal posterior and anterior surfaces with a line-field Optical Coherence Tomography to reconstruct volumetric biomechanical properties of the cornea. Our previous work has made fundamental advances in the understanding of corneal biomechanics through a novel approach with potentially impactful applications in other disciplines (e.g. cataract surgery, LAISK, corneal cross-linking, and tissue transplants with personalize treatments). The proposed studies will accelerate transition of this technology into clinics, influence our selection and application of corneal surgical treatments and will help us to understand the structural consequences of corneal disease and wound healing: Aim 1. Develop a line-field OCE (LF-OCE) system for ultrafast 3D clinical imaging. Aim 2. In vivo studies with rabbits. Aim 3. Preliminary clinical studies in humans. Aim 4. Refine numerical (FEM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models of the depth-dependent nonlinear viscoelastic properties of the cornea. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will focus on the development of novel technology and methods for noninvasive assessment of biomechanical properties of the cornea.

"Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1 PROJECT SUMMARY Previous studies showed discrepancies of health and behavior prevalence between American Indians (AI) population and other racial or ethnic groups. Most health surveys have certain limitations when studying AI population due to the small sample sizes for AI population. Data collected by AI Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs) provides an excellent opportunity to conduct research for AI population due to sufficient sample size and extensive information. However, most surveys conducted by TECs used non-probability sampling design (e.g. convenient sample) due to its lower cost and increased time efficiency. Non-probability sample may suffer from sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors without further proper adjustments. Such difficulties greatly hampers the analysis of AI population in health and behavior research. Our general hypothesis is that data integration by combining information from non-probability and probability samples can reduce sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors in original non-probability sample. The Goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust data integration methodology for AI population analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research. During the past years, we have 1) studied data integration using calibration and parametric modeling approaches; 2) investigated machine learning and propensity score modeling methods in survey sampling and other fields; and 3) assembled an experienced team of multi-disciplinary team of experts. In this project, we propose to capitalize on our expertise and fulfill the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a data integration approach using machine learning and propensity score modeling We will develop machine learning and propensity score based data integration approaches to combine information from non-probability and probability samples. Compared to existing methods (i.e., Calibration, Parametric approach), our proposed approaches are more robust against the failure of underlying model assumptions. The inference is more general and multi-purpose (e.g. one can estimate most parameters such as means, totals and percentiles). Simulation studies will be performed to compare our proposed methods with other existing methods. A computing package will be built to implement the method in other settings. Aim 2. Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in AI health and behavior research We will use real data to validate the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to the various data types. The performance will also be assessed by comparing with results from existing data integration methods such as calibration and parametric modeling approaches. The planned study takes advantage of a unique data source and expands the impact of the Indian Health Service (IHS)-funded research. We expect this novel integration method will vertically advance the field by facilitating the analysis based on non-probability sample, which can provide in-depth understanding regarding the AI population health and behavior studies. Project Narrative The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop an accurate, robust and multi-purpose data integration methodology for AI population (non-probability sample) analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research such as diabetes and smoking. The code implementing the proposed method will be released and is general enough to be applied to AI population studies of other fileds. The success of this study will vertically advance the field by facilitating the AI population analysis, which can provide a better guidance and new insights on the future precision personalized prevention and treatment of certain diseases.",Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1,10271402,R21MD014658,"['Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'American Indians', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Calibration', 'Censuses', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geographic state', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Fairs', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'High Prevalence', 'Kansas', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oklahoma', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Probability Samples', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respondent', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'United States Indian Health Service', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cigarette smoking', 'cluster computing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'simulation', 'smoking prevalence', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tribal health']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R21,2021,109613
"Climate Penalty: Climate-driven Increases in Ozone and PM2.5 Levels and Mortality Project Summary Climate change is the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century. While numerous pathways of the health impact of climate change have been proposed, the “climate penalty” effect, i.e., a warming temperature worsens ambient air quality and consequently influences human health, remains poorly understood, resulting in an underestimated public health burden associated with global warming. Our previous epidemiological studies have reported that higher summer mean temperatures and higher PM2.5 concentrations are each associated with increased all-cause mortality in the Medicare population (aged ≥65) in the Southeastern US (SEUS)1, 2. Satellite and ground-based observations suggest a strong dependence of air pollution on interannual variabilities of summer mean temperature in SEUS3. These findings suggest that the indirect health effect of temperature via the climate penalty on air quality can be potentially important in the SEUS region, in addition to the direct adverse effects that we observed. However, clear epidemiological evidence of the air pollution serving as a mediator for the health effects of temperature, and accurate estimate of this effect is still missing in current literature. Herein, drawing on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that rising temperature can indirectly affect all-cause mortality via worsening both PM2.5 and ozone levels in the SEUS. We propose a study that will leverage the Medicare cohort from 2000-2016 (124 million person-years), the largest longitudinal cohort available for the SEUS and the high-resolution temperature, PM2.5, and O3 data, to investigate all-cause mortality in response to the “climate penalty” effect using a mediation statistical analysis. Specifically, in this project we will (1) update the present- day temperature and ozone predictions at 1-km2 grids across the SEUS through 2016 by incorporating ensemble averaging of machine learning models; (2) quantify the health effect of “climate penalty” on all-cause mortality using a mediation analysis, and explore whether mitigating anthropogenic air pollution emissions might serve as a pathway of climate change adaptation; (3) perform a risk assessment on the excess deaths related to the climate penalty on air pollution for the mid- (2050) and late-21st century (2100), using climate model output, chemical transport modeling, along with the top-down estimate of “climate penalty” from Aim 2. The proposed research will improve understanding of the interplays between climate, air pollution, and human health based on real-world big data, and provide epidemiological evidence of an important pathway that climate change adversely affects human health, with immediate relevance to climate and environmental policymaking. Project Narrative This project aims to estimate the health effect of “climate penalty”, i.e., the rising temperature indirectly affects human health via worsening ambient air quality (primarily PM2.5 and ozone levels) using a mediation analysis based on satellite-retrieved exposures and Medicare all-cause mortality. We will test the hypotheses that 1) the indirect health effect of a warming climate by worsening air quality can be a major public health burden of future climate change, and 2) improving air quality by reducing anthropogenic emission can mitigate the health effect of climate penalty. We will also forecast the excess deaths in 2050 and 2100 related to the climate penalty on air pollution using climate model ensembles simulated for different emission scenarios.",Climate Penalty: Climate-driven Increases in Ozone and PM2.5 Levels and Mortality,10218738,R21ES032606,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Environmental Policy', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Global Warming', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Planet Earth', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Assessment', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Weather', 'air pollution control', 'anthropogenesis', 'atmospheric chemistry', 'base', 'climate change', 'climate impact', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fine particles', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'oxidation', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'resilience', 'response', 'tropospheric ozone', 'ventilation', 'volatile organic compound', 'warm temperature']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,260895
"Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors PROJECT SUMMARY Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by persons with dementia (PWD), affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Agitation brings much stress and detriment to patients and caregivers. Treatment of agitation is often pharmacological intervention which can have adverse side effects. There is a great need for identification of early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation so that it can pave the way for proactive management of agitation and lower the burden on caregivers. The overall goal of this project is to address this critical unmet need through the proposed research and mentored training of the applicant. The Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH), under the direction of Dr. Kaye (proposed primary mentor), has more than a decade of experience developing and deploying a digital behavioral assessment platform in older adults' homes and has the experience analyzing the data collected in the clinical context of older adults. The scientific goals of this proposal are to develop digital behavioral markers that identify episodes of agitation, identify early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation, and build a risk prediction model of episodes of agitation using environmental and behavioral sensors and techniques from machine learning and time series analysis. The applicant will collect behavioral data from 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living in memory care units and 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living at their own homes using passive infrared motion sensors, wearable actigraphy devices, and bed pressure mats and follow them for 2 years. Such behavioral data will be used to identify digital behavioral markers that indicate or predict episodes of agitation. The applicant will also collect environmental data (ambient light level, noise level, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure) from their living environments, and such data will be used to identify environmental precipitants of agitation. In order to conduct the proposed study and prepare for an independent research career, the applicant will be trained through taking courses and attending workshops in the following areas: (1) the different diagnosis and standard of care for PWD, their neuropsychiatric symptoms and their precipitants; (2) methods of using technology in dementia research; (3) novel methods from deep learning and time series analysis for building risk prediction models of agitation; and (4) development of professional skills for conducting successful and ethically responsible clinical research. The proposed team of mentors and consultant each provide expertise in one or more of these areas and are together committed to collaboratively facilitating the applicant's training. The applicant will apply these new skills to the proposed research project and obtain R01 support in order to use the methods for detecting and predicting episode of agitation to create and explore the effectiveness of early interventions for agitation in PWD. Such findings are likely to lead to improve methods for reducing and detecting episodes of agitation and ultimately help protect caregivers' physical and mental health while improving dementia care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms among persons with dementia, affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Pharmacological treatment of agitation often has adverse side effects, and time-constrained caregivers cannot reasonably be expected to monitor the patients and take continuous note of the environment to identify precipitants of agitation. The research and training for this Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award will be centered on identifying digital behavioral markers both during and preceding agitation, identifying environmental precipitants of agitation, and building risk prediction models of agitation using data collected from patients with later-stage dementia and their living environment.",Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors,10190522,K25AG071841,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Controlled Environment', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Family Caregiver', 'Formal caregiver', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Activity', 'Noise', 'Nursing Records', 'Oregon', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Residential Treatment', 'Resources', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging and technology', 'analytical method', 'barometric pressure', 'burnout', 'care providers', 'career', 'caregiver strain', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal caregiver', 'intervention cost', 'memory care', 'motion sensor', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'pressure', 'research and development', 'research study', 'residence', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'standard of care']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,147437
"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Abstract Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided combination radiation treatment approach is likely to substantially improve patient outcome compared to current standard practice of internal or external radiation only.",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,10206138,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluable Disease', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver parenchyma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'dosimetry', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,657625
"Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research Project Summary/Abstract Disparities in health and health care have been a longstanding challenge in the United States. One specific area of medical care in which racial/ethnic disparities have been identified is total joint arthroplasty (TJA), particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Large, population based studies necessary to address healthcare disparities can be costly and difficult to perform, and may be compromised by sampling strategies and patient selection biases. Efficient alternatives are publicly-available nationally representative databases such as the HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The SID provide information on all patients admitted to hospitals within participating states, allowing for comparison of health care access among many vulnerable populations, across states, and over time. The NIS is the largest publicly-available all-payer inpatient health care database in the nation. It is sampled from the SID through a complex survey design, yielding national estimates of health care utilization, quality, and outcomes. A significant limitation of the NIS and the SID is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient race”, a key indicator for health disparities research, has a high proportion of missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) approaches have been increasingly popular for providing sound statistical methods to account for missing data. When conducting MI, it is suggested that imputation models be as general as data allow them to be, in order to accommodate a wide range of subsequent analyses of imputed data sets. This requires all relationships that are going to be investigated in any subsequent analysis, such as nonlinearities and interactions, to be included in the imputation model. Unfortunately, traditional MI methods, such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), are built on parametric imputation models. These models are often not flexible enough to capture interactions and nonlinearities in high dimensional and large scale data settings. Unlike parametric models, machine learning techniques (MLTs) are model-free methods, and thus provide flexibility for missing data imputation. MLTs use algorithms that automatically and iteratively learn from all data to detect statistical dependencies in observations without being explicitly programmed where to look. The goal of this study is to make the two HCUP databases a more useful resource for the study of surgical disparities and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, we propose novel MI methods based on MLTs to impute missing data in the SID and the NIS, and to use the imputed datasets to measure racial disparity in TKA. Project Narrative It would be challenging to approach the goal of eliminating healthcare disparities without identifying disparities and analyzing the underlying causes using nationally representative databases such as the HCUP SID and NIS. This proposal imputes missing data for surgical disparities research using the two databases.",Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research,10199999,R01MD013901,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'administrative database', 'autoencoder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'high dimensionality', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large scale data', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial disparity', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'underserved community', 'usability']",NIMHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,241504
"Data-Driven Phenotyping of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Project Summary This predoctoral fellowship will provide the applicant (Hayley Falk), a doctoral candidate in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, with the skills necessary to become an independent research investigator with expertise in novel applications of machine learning for TBI. The limited accuracy of current models for early prediction of GCS 3-8 TBI (commonly referred to as severe TBI) outcomes (prognostic models) is a major barrier to improving the clinical care of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI. Less than 20% of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI experience a good neurologic recovery and currently there are no therapeutic agents that improve long-term outcomes. In GCS 3-8 TBI clinical trials of promising therapeutic agents, a favorable outcome is typically defined as a better outcome than would be expected, taking into account the predicted prognosis for each individual patient. Therefore, accurate estimation of predicted prognosis is critical to assessing the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. The leading prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI, IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI) and CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury), have undergone extensive external validation, however, the discriminative accuracy is highly cohort dependent with AUCs as low as 0.60 in some patient groups. The two major limitations of the IMPACT and CRASH models include one-time measurements of clinical predictor variables and regression-based methods, which are not designed to handle complex, multidimensional datasets. Our objective is to derive a dynamic prognostic model which provides updated outcome predictions as new data becomes available. We will then develop a clustering algorithm to identify physiologically distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous, high frequency data streams. Our proposed goals will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) we will derive a dynamic prognostic model using a RNN (recurrent neural network)-based framework and data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2) which provides updated 6-month outcome predictions every 24 hours; and 2) using time series hierarchical clustering and continuous measures of physiologic parameters collected from subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 during the first two weeks post-injury, we will identify distinct subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that our dynamic prognostic model derived from time-varying data will have a higher discriminative accuracy (AUC) than a static prognostic model (similar to IMPACT and CRASH) derived using single timepoint data collected on the day of injury. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI characterized by continuous physiologic parameters such as increasing ICP (intracranial pressure), decreasing CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure), and decreasing PbtO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) will be associated with poor 6-month outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed project aims to address the limitations of current prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI using state- of-the-art machine learning techniques including RNNs (recurrent neural networks) and time series hierarchical clustering. Using time-varying data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from GCS 3-8 TBI subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2), we will use a RNN-based framework to derive a dynamic prognostic model which improves upon the accuracy of existing static TBI prognostic models and a time series hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous physiologic parameters and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome.

"VR-Based Evaluation and Training System for Emergency Responders and Managers Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) systems are increasingly being utilized as training platforms for complex, extremely demanding or rarely executed tasks. Often, VR systems focus primarily on delivering increasingly realistic scenarios for training purposes without any capability to assess or refine trainee performance in situ. Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT training not only delivers realistic scenarios, but also measures and evaluates performance using scientifically validated measures of variables associated with both individual and team performance. The advantage of our approach is to immerse first responders in HAZMAT emergency scenarios that are realistic and also designed to focus on measurement and refinement of specific areas of performance. Key contributors to performance among emergency responders and managers were identified by an extensive review of the literature and subsequent tested for association by psychometric assessment of over three hundred emergency responders. A subset of 18 highly associated contributors were then identified through statistical analysis of survey results. These contributors can be measurably represented in VR Training scenario elements. Performance related to each can then be measured and assessed for individual or team trainees. These refined key contributors can then be validated on larger, more diverse samples of emergency responders using the beta version of our proposed VR-based system. Our VR system is also a configurable platform that enables the evaluation and training of a wide range of skills needed by distinct roles (police, firefighters, EMTs, etc.) in diverse scenarios such as biosafety spills, HAZMAT disasters and bioterrorism threats. Also, HAZMAT disasters that are rare or very difficult/costly to create real world training events can be more easily and cost effectively mastered. Scenarios also can be dynamically modulated by trainer input in real-time, or by computerized Artificial Intelligence analysis of performance and trainee real-time physiological measures to rapidly optimize specific key contributor performance of individuals and teams. Rapid, efficient and effective training of emergency responders serves the ultimate goal of minimizing potential catastrophic consequences of these events.

"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction.

"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",10064003,R00HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'survivorship', 'tenure track', 'unstructured data', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2021,249000
"Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS Abstract  Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions that are usually detected by screening mammography. Workup generally includes a percutaneous (core) Biopsy (Bx) for histologic confirmation, followed by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), followed by breast-conserving excision, and adjuvant radiation. Approximately 20-25% of patients with core Bx-confirmed DCIS are upstaged to invasive carcinoma upon pathology of resected tissue. Foreknowledge of this would dictate a more aggressive surgical intervention, including sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging. Further, another 20-25% of patients are judged to have low-risk disease and current thought is that such women may have better outcomes in an active surveillance setting, and this is being tested in clinical trials. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project is to use machine learning to identify biochemical (SA1) or imaging (SA2) biomarkers, as well as their combination (SA3) to discriminate indolent from aggressive DCIS, as determined by upstaging upon excisional biopsy.  The major hypothesis to be tested in this work is that hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related proteins (HRPs) can discriminate aggressive from more indolent DCIS, and that this can be used for decision support. Expression of HRPs is optimally characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we have deployed methods for multiplexed IHC, as well as methods for advanced analytics using machine learning (pathomics). We have also shown that hypoxic habitats within breast cancers can be identified from mpMRI using machine learning (radiomics). We thus propose to use pathomics of core biopsies and radiomics of mpMRI to determine the presence and extent of hypoxic habitats in DCIS prior to surgery to predict subsequent upstaging after surgical resection. This work will be performed in Aim 1 for pathomics and Aim 2 for radiomics, and Aim 3 will develop combined radio-pathomics predictors. Each aim will contain: (a) retrospective arms for training, tuning, and testing; and (b) prospective internal and external cohorts for rigorous validation. For the retrospective studies, we have identified 604 cases wherein women with DCIS obtained core Bx, mpMRI, and surgery with pathology at Moffitt in the last 10 years. Internal prospective studies will accrue ~6 women/month who have consented to the total Cancer Care® protocol and who have their complete workup at Moffitt. External validation cohorts will be accrued at UCSF and at Advent Health.  At the end of this work we will have developed a risk model for DCIS that can be deployed prior to surgery to guide decisions along the spectrum from active surveillance at one end to more extensive surgical intervention at the other. This is expected to lay a foundation for subsequent interventional trials. Additionally, the inclusion of hypoxia as a central hypothesis has high potential to illuminate components of the natural history of this disease. Narrative  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies of the breast and data are lacking with regard to optimal treatment. Consequently, the majority of DCIS are treated in the same manner: i.e. surgery +/- radiation +/- hormonal therapy that results in either over- or under-treatment of many patients. In the current work we will test the hypothesis that histologic or radiologic markers prior to surgery can guide decision support by identifying predicting up-staging and pathological risk scoring following surgical excision.",Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS,10120171,R01CA249016,"['Acidosis', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Axilla', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consent', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Excision biopsy', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Indolent', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resected', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'breast malignancies', 'cancer care', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disease natural history', 'disorder risk', 'hormone therapy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'optimal treatments', 'practical application', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,H.

"A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice Abstract With growing interest in personalized medicine and the rise of machine learning, constructing good risk prediction and prognostic models has been drawing renewed attention. In this development, much effort is concentrated in identifying good predictors of patient outcomes, although the same level of rigor is often absent in improving the outcome side of prediction. The majority of popular supervised techniques (e.g., regularized logistic regression and its variations), which can be readily applied in risk model development, assumes that the prediction target is a clear single outcome measured at a single time point. In clinical reality, patient outcomes are often complex, multivariate, and measured with errors. Even when a target is a relatively clear univariate outcome (e.g., death, cancer, diabetes, etc), the process that leads to this ultimate outcome often involves complex intermediate outcomes, where predicting and understanding this intermediate process can be crucial in providing effective care and preventing negative ultimate outcomes. The situation calls for a ﬂexible learning framework that can easily incorporate this important but neglected aspect in model development - better characterizing and constructing prediction targets before building prediction models.  Focusing on risk labels as prediction targets, we propose a pragmatic 3-stage learning approach, where we sequentially 1) generate latent labels, 2) validate them using explicit validators, and 3) go on with supervised learning with labeled data. Latent variable (LV) strategies used in Satge 1 have great potentials in handling complex outcome information. The unsupervised nature of LV strategies makes highly ﬂexible data synthesis and organization possible. The same nature, however, can also be seen as esoteric and subjective, which is not desirable in situations where transparency and reproducibility are of great concern such as in risk prediction. As a practical solution to this problem, we propose the use of explicit clinical validators, which not only makes LV-based labels closely aligned with contemporary science and clinical practice, but also makes it possible to automatically validate and narrow a large pool of candidate labels. With the goal of developing a practical and transparent system of learning and inference for clinical research and practice, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in latent variable modeling, machine learning, psychometrics and causal inference along with clinical/substantive expertise. Our streamlined learning framework focuses on direct and transparent validation of latent variable solutions to ensure clear communication across risk model developers, clinical researchers and practitioners. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction. Narrative This project intends to develop a pragmatic learning and risk predction framework that will facilitate utilization of multivariate data collected from research and health care services, which otherwise is underutilized in developing methods to improve personalized care of future patients. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction, and therefore will have positive impact on public health.",A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice,10212944,R01MH123443,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Intention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data exploration', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'model development', 'neglect', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558490
"Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD ABSTRACT End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies, with 25% dying within 1 year and 41% surviving at least 5 years. While providers recognize that patients are different – and ought to be differently – there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy and aid in treatment individualization. Instead, providers are left with often unclear or incomplete guidelines on how best to manage patients. In order to provide precision care for patients on hemodialysis (HD), there is a critical need to be able to (1) dynamically assess life expectancy for medical decision-making; and (2) identify distinct clinical phenotypes to enhance clinical monitoring and care planning. Our central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in patient survivorship and disease trajectory that, when known, can be used to provide more personalized and effective care. By coupling novel machine learning approaches for survival prediction with granular clinical data on HD patients, we will be able to develop the analytic tools necessary to support precision care. At the completion of this proposal we will have tools to dynamically assess a patient's life expectancy and insights into heterogeneous disease phenotypes for patients with ESKD. These tools will allow providers to make informed treatment decisions as well as lay the groundwork for further precision research into optimized patient care. NARRATIVE End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies. However, there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy.

"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,10057390,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,748815
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10144919,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'detection platform', 'experience', 'home test', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2021,1807912
"Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hospital readmission is an undesirable, costly outcome that may be preventable. Hospitalized patients with diabetes are at higher risk of readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) than patients without diabetes, and >1 million readmissions occur among diabetes patients in the US annually. Certain interventions can reduce readmission risk, but applying these interventions widely is cost prohibitive. One approach for improving the efficiency of interventions that reduce readmission risk is to target high-risk patients. We previously published a model, the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRITM), that predicts the risk of all-cause 30-d readmission of patients with diabetes. The DERRI, however, has modest predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.63- 0.69), and requires manual data input. Recently, we demonstrated that adding variables to the DERRI substantially improves predictive accuracy (DERRIplus, C-statistic 0.82). However, using this larger model to predict readmission risk based on manual input of data would be too labor intensive for clinical settings. Indeed, most readmission risk prediction models are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and ease of use; lack of translation to a tool that integrates with clinical workflow; modest accuracy; lack of validation; and dependence on data only available after hospital discharge.  The objectives of the current proposal are: 1) To develop more accurate all-cause unplanned 30-d readmission risk prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with diabetes (eDERRI); 2) To translate the models to an automated, EHR-based tool that predicts % readmission risk of hospitalized patients; and 3) To prospectively validate the eDERRI models and tool. The new eDERRI models will expand upon the variables in the DERRIplus based on availability in EHR data (e.g., sociodemographics, encounter history, medication use, laboratory results, comorbidities, and length of stay). To develop the models, we will leverage data from the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a multi-center, 40-plus hospital member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). We will apply state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to develop optimal predictive models. This project will analyze a large, multi-center cohort of nearly 340,000 discharges with cutting-edge techniques to develop better models and translate them to an automated tool that predicts readmission risk for individual patients with diabetes. The proposed tool would identify higher risk patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop more accurate models that predict the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. The models will be programmed into a tool that will be integrated with an electronic health record system and automatically predict the re-hospitalization risk of patients. Such a tool could be used to identify higher risk diabetes patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs.",Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes,10245208,R01DK122073,"['Admission activity', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comorbidity Index', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,562886
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,10086491,K23HL135274,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Self Administration', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavior change', 'big biomedical data', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'digital', 'digital medicine', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preempt', 'prevent', 'professor', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,203678
"Harnessing Big Data to Identify Effective Peripheral Artery Disease Treatments in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peripheral artery disease (PAD), characterized by diseased arteries to the limbs, affects 200 million people worldwide and 9 million people in the U.S. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 20 million people in the U.S. and confers a markedly higher risk for PAD. Yet patients with CKD are less likely to have revascularization procedures and are more likely to undergo lower extremity amputation than patients without CKD. In addition to a high prevalence of traditional risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, patients with CKD have other unique risk factors such as chronic inflammation or uremia, which in turn can lead to more aggressive PAD at a younger age. Therefore, patients with CKD need dedicated study. Our overarching goal is to help close these evidence gaps and address these limitations by harnessing the power of Optum Clinformatics Data Mart, which includes over 7 billion claims records on over 83 million unique lives from all 50 states spanning 2005-2019. Our secondary goal is to facilitate future PAD studies using real-world data by leveraging the power of natural language processing to improve our ability to accurately and automatically ascertain PAD from large electronic health record databases. Our innovative algorithm will be of particular importance among subgroups where clinical trial evidence is limited, such as in advanced CKD. Our proposal has the Specific Aims. Aim 1: To evaluate lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis- requiring CKD. We hypothesize that patients with CKD undergoing surgical versus endovascular revascularization will have longer initial hospitalization, but fewer subsequent major adverse limb events. AIM 2: To evaluate antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications after lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis-requiring CKD. We hypothesize that real-world patients with CKD treated with antiplatelet medications or direct oral anticoagulants after lower extremity revascularization will have higher rates of bleeding but lower rates of major adverse limb events. AIM 3: To develop an algorithm that accurately and automatically ascertains PAD from electronic health record databases. We hypothesize that a natural language processing-approach applied to diagnostic vascular testing reports will have better test performance (i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) for identifying PAD than a traditional approach that uses administrative billing codes. Manual chart review will serve as the gold standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects millions of people around the world, causing decreased mobility, non- healing wounds, gangrene and amputations. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a higher risk for PAD and its complications, but relatively little is known about what treatments are effective in this population. Our project aims to narrow some of these knowledge gaps to improve PAD treatment practices for patients with chronic kidney disease.",Harnessing Big Data to Identify Effective Peripheral Artery Disease Treatments in Chronic Kidney Disease,10180665,R01HL151351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Anticoagulants', 'Arteries', 'Aspirin', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Mart', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gangrene', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modernization', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nephrology', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uremia', 'calcification', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'virtual']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354432
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome-Wide Association Studies One promise of precision medicine for Alzheimer’s disease is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association in subjects ascertained with and without Alzheimer’s. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine for Alzheimer’s by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual Alzheimer’s patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to Alzheimer’s clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial Alzheimer’s data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on Alzheimer’s patients derived from a population-level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and Alzheimer’s disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the Alzheimer’s clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated Alzheimer’s knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source to the Alzheimer’s disease research community (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of Alzheimer’s disease result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help Alzheimer’s clinicians and researchers connect population-level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat Alzheimer’s patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome-Wide Association Studies,10284977,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'base', 'data preservation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual', 'virtual intervention']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,391879
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,10218121,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'remote monitoring', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,361146
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,10188375,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2021,129913
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",10120737,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk prediction', 'routine care', 'safety outcomes', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,645032
"Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern PI: Valentina Kutyifa, MD, PhD University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY Morbidity, mortality, and health care costs of the treatment of systolic heart failure (HF) are rapidly increasing. Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) is cost-effectively reducing HF events and death in HF patients with a wide QRS and low ejection fraction. However, response to CRT-D is not unequivocally present in all patients, with less benefit in those without the presence of an ECG abnormality, left bundle branch block (non-LBBB), posing a significant treatment challenge. Because of the conflicting and limited data on response to CRT-D in this cohort, it is possible that we currently treat a large proportion of HF patients with non-LBBB who have limited or no benefit from the device. Therefore, better selection of patients for this expensive therapy is warranted. One of our recent studies suggested a clinical benefit in patients with non-LBBB and marked echocardiography response, and identified predictors. However, there is a need to prospectively validate these predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB in this hard-to-treat patient population, and identify potential novel ECG and echocardiography predictors, utilizing novel statistical methods of machine learning. We propose a prospective, observational, single-arm study in a currently guideline-indicated cohort to validate and identify predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D, including novel ECG and echocardiography markers, and to assess subsequent clinical outcomes in 270 HF patients with an implanted CRT-D and non-LBBB ECG pattern. The primary aim of the study is to prospectively validating our previously identified clinical predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in HF patients with non-LBBB that could enable better patient selection. Our secondary aim is to identify the incremental value of novel ECG and echocardiography variables to predict echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB patients, including ECG variables of sum absolute QRST integral and ventricular electrical activation delay, and echocardiography-derived variables of left ventricular dyssynchrony and contractility. Then we will apply the developed predictive model to prospectively identify non- LBBB patients with CRT-D at a risk of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Tertiary aim is to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors of response in non-LBBB using machine learning analysis. Study population will include 270 HF patients with non-LBBB (135 with mild HF and 135 with advanced HF) and an implanted CRT-D with 6 months echocardiography follow-up analyzed by an echocardiography core lab, and assessing clinical outcomes of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) in heart failure (HF) patients without left bundle branch block (non-LBBB) has been less beneficial to improve outcomes despite being a guideline indicated therapy, posing a significant treatment challenge. However, non-LBBB patients with echocardiography response to CRT-D have better outcomes, and pre-implant variables could predict response, identifying patients who benefit the most. In this study, we plan to enroll 270 HF patients with non-LBBB and guideline- indicated CRT-D implantation to validate our prior echocardiography predictor score, and to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors using conventional statistics and machine learning analysis. We will also assess the applicability of such a score for clinical outcomes of HF, ventricular arrhythmias, or death.",Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern,10207993,R01HL153390,"['Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Bundle-Branch Block', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defibrillators', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mosses', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular End-Systolic Volumes', 'arm', 'base', 'cardiac implant', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'statistics', 'study population']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,734112
"Portable Hearing Laboratory  - CRP In the parent Phase II project (R44DC016247; PI: C. Pavlovic) we successfully developed a portable platform for developing and testing new hearing aid technology. This Portable Hearing Laboratory, or PHL, has now been acquired and is being used by a number of leading university laboratories and other research centers and their feedback has been extremely positive. The device features a central unit (BatAndCat Box) which provides an appropriate and complete hearing aid ambient for developing new algorithms. A number of realistic interfaces has also been provided. This includes an extremely high quality BTE system we designed; an ITE system adapted by us, as well as an appropriate interface circuitry for typical wearables (e.g; headsets via the line input). Finally, a smart phone app features interfaces both for the researcher and the subject. The system runs the Master Hearing aid sweet developed concurrently in R01DC015429 (PIs Hohmann and Pavlovic). In this CRP renewal we will achieve the following goals: 1. Implement various Design for Excellence Measures (DFX) and super modern manufacturing  technology to obtain the highest product quality at the lowest product cost. This would make  the product affordable for large clinical studies and, potentially, for some consumer sales. 2. In response to the recent availability of, and the recent research demand for, a far greater  processing power to enable the development of algorithms which rely on machine learning,  we plan to increase the processing power of the device by at least 10 times, and likely 20  times, by changing the processor core to a multicore system. 3. Introduce modern low-latency BLE technology to enable efﬁcient noise reduction by utilizing  remote microphones and machine learning. 4. The other complementary requirement to extract speech from noise is being able to inform  the system whom the listener is actually listening to. This will be achieved by providing on  the PHL the interface means for external multi-sensor arrays such as EEG, OEG, etc. 5. Execute electrical and mechanical design changes dramatically reducing the size and  weight of the device. This would not only be a much more acceptable device for long clinical  trials, but would also open up a direct-to-consumer, secondary market for the device. 6. It is our strong determination to provide continuous support to the Beta sites for extensive  further testing of the device in a variety of settings. We consider this the best means to  reach the perfection. Portable Hearing Laboratory (PHL), developed in R44DC016247 has been deployed successfully at various research centers and it features a central unit connected to a number of realistic interfaces such as BTEs, ITEs, or typical wearables. In this CRP renewal we upgrade the technology to support demanding machine learning algorithms interfaced almost inconspicuously to a number of EEG and EOG electrodes to extract perfectly speech from noise.

"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Hour', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inherited', 'Intake', 'Iontophoresis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Study Subject', 'Sweat Glands', 'Sweat test', 'System', 'Technology', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'dietary supplements', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microsensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision nutrition', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796
"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms. Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The proposed study will produce a personalized (“precision”)-medicine tool using big data to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions for prescribing statins that will maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and statin-associated symptoms.",Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data,10105354,R01HL143390,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Blood', 'Cardiology', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Care Costs', 'Holidays', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Life', 'Link', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insurance claims', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,746285
"Risk and strength: determining the impact of area-level racial bias and protective factors on birth outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY There are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight. Individual-level risk factors do not fully explain the observed disparities. There is increasing evidence for the role of area-level racial bias in explaining these disparities, but we currently lack both the measures, methods, and findings to empirically evaluate its influence. The proposed research will advance the research in all 3 areas. We will be using online and social media data and machine learning models to create two measures of area-level racial bias and implement a robust research design to determine whether area-level racial bias impacts birth outcomes. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, health disparities, machine learning, social media data, biostatistics, and community engaged research—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are to 1) track and detect changes in area-level racial bias and identify local and national race-related events during these time points, 2) determine the impact of changes in area-level racial bias on changes in adverse birth outcomes, and 3) identify protective factors for adverse birth outcomes. Because our data is collected repeatedly and finely across the United States, we can explicitly account for temporal trends and place effects. The proposed study uses new data to capture trends in racial bias with sophisticated machine learning models, and represents a critical advancement in the investigation of racial disparities in birth outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individual-level risk factors are not fully explaining the large and persistent racial disparities in birth outcomes, limiting policy and intervention strategies to reduce these disparities. This project will advance our understanding of the potential effects of racial bias at a population level on the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight and identify protective factors to buffer its impact.",Risk and strength: determining the impact of area-level racial bias and protective factors on birth outcomes.,10096177,R01MD015716,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Rate', 'Birth Weight', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Focus Groups', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural experiment', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Prejudice', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Site', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Work', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'neural network', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial bias', 'racial discrimination', 'racial disparity', 'racial identity', 'racism', 'resilience', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'stressor', 'trend']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,738087
"The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Project Summary/Abstract Despite significant advances in ventilator management, mortality from the acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volume, high pressure ven- tilation, and repeated alveolar collapse can injure the lung, called ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a breath in response to a patient effort, ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may potentiate VILI. This proposal outlines a 5-year training programing including mentoring, formal didactics, and practical research experiences which positions Dr. Sottile for a successful clinical research career examining ventilator dyssynchrony (VD), its impact on ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), and its optimal management. An integrated curriculum will optimize an automated VD detection algorithm, delineate which types of VD are deleterious, and determine the ideal ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD and improve patient outcomes. This experience will provide Dr. Sottile with the necessary tools to be a leader in signal analysis, ventilator dyssynchrony, advanced mathematical modeling, and critical care research. This program will consist of formal mentoring from four renowned experts in machine learning, mechanical ventilation, critical care research, and modeling of dynamic systems. In addition, coursework in clinical sciences, machine learning, and advanced mathematical modeling will build the theoretical foundation to apply these techniques. This structured curriculum will help Dr. Sottile gain expertise in the computerized detection of VD from real-time ventilator data, the pathophysiology of VD, and the modeling of complex, temporally dynamic, biological systems. The formal curriculum will coincide with three practical experiences. First, Dr. Sottile will optimize his already developed VD identification algorithm to detect additional types of VD that may be injurious to the lung. Second, he will identify which types of VD are associated with deleterious ventilator mechanics. Finally, he will deter- mine the personalized ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD, VILI, and the negative consequences of over sedation using linear optimization and lagged linear correlation to account for the dynamic nature of patient physiology. The result of the proposed studies will develop a computerized algorithm to detect seven types of VD, identify which types of VD are most likely to propagate VILI, and determine the optimal ventilator and sedation strategies to improve individual patient outcomes. This will leave Dr. Sottile and the study team positioned to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing computer-predicted individualized ventilator and se- dation strategies compared to the current standard of care. If successful, this will potentially to revolutionize the use of mechanical ventilation by tailoring evidenced-based therapies to the individual patient. Project Narrative Despite over 50 years of research, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts of over 10% of ICU admissions. Despite current treatment strategies focused on reducing ventilator induced lung injury through low tidal volume ventilation or prone position, mortality remains over 30%. This proposal seeks to understand how patient-ventilator interactions may propagate lung injury and will determine optimal treatment strategies to improve patient- ventilator interactions, decrease lung injury, and improve patient outcomes.","The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony",10080102,K23HL145011,"['Accounting', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dysbarism', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Esophagus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Induction of neuromuscular blockade', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manometry', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prone Position', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training Programs', 'Ventilator', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'biological systems', 'career', 'computerized', 'dynamic system', 'esophagus pressure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'lung injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized strategies', 'pressure', 'programs', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2021,169654
"Selection of Flow Modulation Protocols for Patients on Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices (CF-VADs) PROJECT SUMMARY A major concern with continuous flow ventricular assist devices (CF-VADs) is the resulting non-physiological flow with diminished pulsatility which has been shown to be a major risk factor for development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. To address this issue, flow modulation via rapid changes in pump impeller speed has been proposed as a technique to introduce ‘artificial pulsatility’. However, given the inadequacy of large animal models with recreating CF-VAD associated non-surgical bleeding events, it is still unclear if artificial pulsatility can prevent these adverse events or what level of artificial pulsatility is even necessary. To evaluate the effects of pulsatility and identify promising flow modulation approaches we developed a vascular pulse perfusion model (VPPM) to culture Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAECs) under conditions of normal pulsatile flow or flow with diminished pulsatility (CF-VAD support). Our rationale for modeling arterial vessels is because pulsatility primarily affects the arterial side of the circulatory system and its effects are transduced by endothelial cells that line the large arterial vessels. The VPPM was validated as relevant model via direct comparison with aortic samples of patients with and without CF-VADs. Our published data also shows that loss of pulsatility is associated with an increase in production of pro-angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The relevance of these results is further strengthened by supporting data from patients that experience AVMs and GI bleeding events (both CF-VAD related and due to other conditions) showing similar elevated levels of pro- angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The VPPM therefore provides a powerful model to evaluate artificial pulsatility in the context of CF-VAD flow modulation and determine if restoring pulse pressure and/or pulse frequency can mitigate non-surgical bleeding events. Based on recent studies that suggest that pulse pressure < 35 mmHg is a major risk factor for development of GI bleeds, we hypothesize that “Diminished pulsatility associated with ‘CF-VAD support’ results in endothelial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory/pro-angiogenic soluble factor production. These changes can be mitigated via introduction of artificial pulsatility using flow modulation strategies where pulse pressure is preserved at > 35 mmHg”. Aim1 will evaluate response of patient derived endothelial cells within the VPPM to CF-VAD flow and quantify angiogenic/inflammatory soluble factor production, Aim2 will follow patients for up to 36 months to evaluate serum levels of pro-angiogenic/pro- inflammatory cytokines and non-surgical bleeding events which will then be compared to results from in-vitro studies within the VPPM and Aim3 will evaluate different flow modulation strategies using patient-derived endothelial cells to determine most promising patient-specific approaches via comparison of hemodynamic profiles and cytokine biomarkers using deep learning approaches. Successful completion of this project will enable identification of device-based strategies to prevent non-surgical bleeding in patients on CF-VAD support. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to determine the effects of diminished pulsatility during continuous flow ventricular assist device (CF-VAD) support on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Changes in production of pro- angiogenic/pro-inflammatory cytokines will be used as biomarkers to evaluate the effects of loss of pulsatility and help validate new approaches to introduce artificial pulsatility in CF-VADs.",Selection of Flow Modulation Protocols for Patients on Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices (CF-VADs),10116660,R01HL151663,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Arteriovenous malformation', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelin-1', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Heart failure', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Sheep', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transducers', 'Translating', 'VWF gene', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety testing', 'ventricular assist device']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,535547
"ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention Project Summary Recent large-scale trials have shown no significant benefit of pharmacological interventions in delirium patients, and non-pharmacological approaches remain the cornerstone of delirium prevention. Among those strategies, minimizing patient immobility and circadian desynchrony are particularly difficult to implement, as their assessment is dependent on sporadic human observations. The overall objective of this application is to develop ADAPT, the Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention system using novel pervasive sensing and deep learning techniques. It will autonomously quantify patients’ mobility and circadian desynchrony in terms of nightly disruptions, light intensity, and sound pressure level. This will allow for integration of these risk factors into a dynamic model for predicting delirium trajectories. It will also enable adaptive action prompts aimed at increasing patients’ mobility, reducing nightly disruptions, optimizing ambient light, and reducing noise, based on precise real-time quantification. The rationale is that successful application of the proposed technology would augment clinical-decision making in the fast-paced ICU environment and would promote more targeted interventions. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the delirium trajectory, to determine if it is more accurate in predicting delirium trajectory transitions compared to existing tools, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous monitoring of mobility and circadian desynchrony, to determine if it can provide accurate assessments compared to human expert and circadian biomarkers, and if it can enrich delirium trajectory prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Developing and evaluating prompts for adaptive delirium prevention using real-time monitoring system, to determine if the system has acceptable satisfaction and perceived benefit among ICU physicians. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise delirium trajectory, (2) autonomously monitor mobility and circadian desynchrony risk factors in the ICU, and (3) implement adaptive preventions in real time. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time delirium trajectory prediction models, (2) uncaptured aspects of mobility and circadian desynchrony, and (3) the need for novel approaches for non-pharmacological prevention. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to advancing disease diagnosis through medical applications of new tools and technologies, as the proposed research applies advanced computational methods and sensing technologies to automatically quantify and convey patient status in real-time.",ADAPT: Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention,10178157,R01NS120924,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Hospital Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient mobility', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'sound', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,612618
"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not. In this project we will leverage recent progress in the development of pathophysiologically informed MRI based imaging biomarkers along with novel computational image analysis, to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform clinical decision making to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness.",Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB),10194614,R01MH122139,"['Adjuvant', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clozapine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuromelanin', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychosocial', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,710640
"BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series Project summary Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds, for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults, and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability. Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength, and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions. Project Narrative Big data can form the basis for more precise, personalized, interventions for ICU patients, but it is challenging for clinicians to integrate a large number of complex signals. Our work will allow data to guide treatment by making machine learning more accurate and providing better ways of combining insights from many patients (each of whose data may be incomplete). These will aid in understanding consciousness in neurological and neonatal ICUs.",BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series,10123124,R01LM011826,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Altered Level of Consciousness', 'Behavior assessment', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conscious', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological status', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unconscious State', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawing Care', 'Work', 'causal model', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'effective intervention', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neonatal patient', 'neonate', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'premature', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'privacy preservation', 'respiratory', 'response', 'simulation', 'stroke patient', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NLM,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,295006
"Synthesizing Intraoperative Multivariate Time Series with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks Project Summary/Abstract Patient safety is paramount in anesthesia. Intraoperative complications and hemodynamic instability are associated with reduced long-term survival and can lead to risks such as myocardial injury, stroke, kidney injury, and even death. Therefore, predicting and preventing intraoperative hemodynamic instability is very important in the decision-making process of anesthesia providers. An ideal pre-operative assessment system would predict, from patient information, all intraoperative complications and physiological changes before a surgical procedure begins. Predicting intraoperative hemodynamic instability during surgery requires analyzing an enormous amount of physiological data and spotting patterns in that data before adverse events occur. However, doing this requires a large volume of high-resolution intraoperative data taken directly from the physiological monitors in the operating room to train machine learning models, and these data currently are unavailable. Therefore, the research goal of this proposed training program is to generate a continuous multivariate intraoperative physiological time series that display the effects of anesthesia management using state-of-the-art mathematic tools. The generated data can provide unlimited and realistic intraoperative data to identify intraoperative complications and later build a real-time intraoperative clinical decision support system. The proposed training program has two aims. Aim 1 will enable the applicant to create a data-driven objective approach for intraoperative complication prediction and risk assessment. Key information from anesthesia pre- op assessment will be used to generate synthetic low-resolution intraoperative physiological data. This data will inform anesthesia providers of the type, timing, and range of a given patient’s intraoperative hemodynamic instability and complications before surgery. Aim 2 will enable the applicant to build a virtual database that will provide unlimited high-resolution intraoperative data to train machine learning algorithms for a future real-time intraoperative clinical decision support system. The recorded low-resolution intraoperative data and the key information from anesthesia pre-op assessment will be inputted into the second tool to upscale existing minute- resolution intraoperative data to second-resolution level for data augmentation to boost the number of available surgical cases. This K08 research program will enable the applicant to fill key knowledge gaps in applying data science in the existing low-resolution intraoperative data in medical records and non-recorded high-resolution intraoperative data displayed by anesthesia devices. The results will orient anesthesia providers and researchers in the design and implementation of data-driven perioperative prediction systems over traditional anesthesia risk assessment. Ultimately, this K08 award will provide the applicant with the senior mentorship, skills, research experience and data resources to become an independent nurse investigator after training. Project Narrative The proposed training program will enable the applicant to apply generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to widely available pre-operative evaluation notes and data from an anesthesia information management system (AIMS) to improve patient outcomes. The training will comprise the creation of (1) one GAN framework for generating realistic synthetic low-resolution AIMS data from patient profiles in pre- operative evaluation notes and (2) The second GAN framework for generating synthetic high-resolution intraoperative physiological data from low-resolution AIMS data and patient profiles. From this, the applicant aims to (1) investigate the feasibility of using GAN architecture to improve pre-operative risk assessment and (2) create a database for intraoperative high-resolution multivariate time series gathered from both low- resolution AIMS data and pre-operative evaluation notes, which can be used to train machine learning algorithms for a future real-time intraoperative clinical-decision support system designed to assist anesthesia providers deliver safer care.",Synthesizing Intraoperative Multivariate Time Series with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,10188838,K08GM141489,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator Award', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Display', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Science', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Intraoperative Complications', 'Intraoperative Monitoring', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nurses', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Science', 'Series', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'myocardial injury', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2021,189794
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop statistical methods to detect and resolve unmeasured confounding bias by leveraging prior knowledge about known-null effects widely available but often underappreciated in healthcare data — thereby facilitating valid and reproducible research in vaccine effectiveness and safety studies.",Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework,10093358,R01GM139926,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Plague', 'Plague Vaccine', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'adverse event risk', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'effectiveness study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'public health priorities', 'safety study', 'semiparametric', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine evaluation', 'vaccine safety', 'vaccine trial']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,401613
"Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy This K24 grant will provide the PI, Dr. Lin Yee Chen, a midcareer NIH-funded patient-oriented research (POR) investigator, with the protected time and support needed to (1) accelerate his current trajectory in mentoring junior clinicians and investigators who are conducting POR in cardiovascular (CV) science, (2) acquire additional training in mentoring methods, machine learning, and omics science, (3) promote his current research that aims to define the mechanisms underlying the relationship of the abnormal atrial substrate—atrial cardiomyopathy—and atrial fibrillation (AF) to ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes. Trainees in his AF Clinical Research Group will be recruited from the NIH-funded T32 training programs in the University of Minnesota's Division of Cardiology, Division of Epidemiology, and Division of Biostatistics; Department of Medicine Physician Scientist Training Program; KL2 and TL1 Programs of the CTSI; and graduate programs (MS in Clinical Research, MPH, and PhD) in the School of Public Health. For his career development, Dr. Chen will hone his mentoring skills and learn new skills in cutting-edge areas (machine learning and omics science) through focused study, selected coursework, seminars, and guidance from senior collaborators with domain expertise. Finally, this grant will support a research project that is based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, which extends Dr. Chen’s ongoing work to elucidate the role of atrial cardiomyopathy in driving AF-related outcomes. The specific aims are: (1) Identify atrial cardiomyopathy subtypes by using machine learning approaches to analyze the extensive data at ARIC Visit 5 (2011-13): clinical, 2D-echocardiographic, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, ECG, and multi-omics data, (2) Evaluate association of subtypes with ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes, and (3) Discover specific risk factors for subtypes by analyzing risk factor measures collected at Visits 1-4 (1987-98). Crucially, findings will be validated in 2 independent community-based cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). This project has significant impact: (1) This K24 grant will provide the PI with the protected time to enhance his current mentoring of trainees involved in POR. By assembling a team of senior collaborators that comprise experts in mentoring, data science, and molecular epidemiology, the PI provides an outstanding platform for his mentees to acquire cutting-edge skills in POR, (2) By resolving heterogeneity in atrial cardiomyopathy, the team will advance the NIH’s Precision Medicine initiative by personalizing current treatment for patients based on biological underpinnings, (3) The findings will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in classification of stroke risk in patients with AF, which will improve patient outcomes, (4) By efficiently leveraging existing resources of deeply phenotyped NHLBI cohorts, this project will fill critical knowledge gaps in prevention and treatment, thus achieving a sustained and powerful impact on CV public health, clinical practice, and education of the next generation of researchers in POR. The abnormal atrial substrate (atrial cardiomyopathy) is associated with elevated risks of ischemic stroke dementia, and other cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure. Progress in preventing these adverse outcomes has been hampered by unresolved heterogeneity underlying atrial cardiomyopathy; hence, this K24 grant will support a project that will use machine learning and dense phenotypic data to identify clinically relevant subtypes of atrial cardiomyopathy. Additionally, this K24 grant will foster a supportive environment for the mentoring of junior investigators involved in patient-oriented research and facilitate acquisition of new cutting-edge skills by the PI and his mentees.",Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy,10307378,K24HL155813,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Atrial Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'aptamer', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'exome', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rate variability', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'patient oriented research', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'stroke risk', 'supportive environment', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,K24,2021,126631
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10266121,R01AG069765,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical dementia rating scale', 'Code', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'patient screening', 'response', 'rural area', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'suburb', 'tool', 'underserved area', 'validation studies']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,1048978
"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,10067371,F31HL151178,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Social Identification', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'age group', 'base', 'biracial', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'cohort', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'good diet', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2021,41249
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images African American and Latinx communities nationally and in California not only bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths but are also not taking part in COVID-19 testing for a wide range of understudied reasons. This can have profound implications in safety net health care settings where vulnerable patients, who are in need of clinical procedures to prevent significant morbidity, are refusing such potentially lifesaving procedures because of fear of COVID-19 testing and/or contracting COVID-19. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the second largest publicly operated county safety net health care system in the United States, serving more than 750,000 patients annually. Timely access to health care in this under-resourced, high-need setting has been an ongoing challenge for its majority Latinx and African American patients. With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why patients refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. To this end, we propose to explore the obstacles to COVID-19 pre- procedural testing and provide COVID-19 specific training to LACDHS Community Health Workers (CHWs) from these same communities to effectively address: a) the primary goal of increasing COVID-19 testing for individual patients, and the secondary goals of b) facilitating needed procedural care in a timely manner for the safety net health system, and c) developing a sustained public health presence in these communities to build trust and preparedness for critical COVID-19 related future needs. Trained CHWs can help to more effectively overcome obstacles to COVID-19 testing, including historical barriers of mistrust, provide COVID-19 health education, help address social determinants of health and help facilitate technological literacy to improve patient access to testing and care in a telehealth environment. The proposal uses a multidisciplinary, mixed- methods approach including unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to systematically explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing among vulnerable safety net patients. We will then train clinically based, ethnically/linguistically matched CHWs to implement a hypothesis-driven intervention consisting of six group classes and six personalized patient encounters with African American and Latinx safety net patients. This study has the following specific aims: Aim 1- Utilize machine learning methods to assess whether there are characteristics that define African American and Latinx safety-net patients who engage in or refuse COVID-19 testing; Aim 2 - Conduct in-depth interviews with African American and Latinx patients who either declined or accepted COVID testing to explore contextual, behavioral, and attitudinal factors shaping patient circumstances and concerns; Aim 3 - Develop, implement, and pre-test a CHW intervention with the information from Aims 1 and 2, utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients to assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing. Project Narrative With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why vulnerable patients in safety net health care settings refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. This grant is an innovative proposal that seeks to (1) bring together machine learning and behavioral methods to understand the reasons why Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) safety net patients who require COVID-19 testing for procedures refuse or accept COVID-19 testing, and (2) utilize the knowledge gleaned to implement a Community Health Worker (CHW)-based intervention, using LACDHS CHWs, that addresses the multilevel obstacles to COVID- 19 testing. Insights gained from this research may be of benefit to improve COVID-19 uptake in other similar safety net settings with CHWs and in planning the future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in such medically underserved settings.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,10258973,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavioral', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 testing', 'COVID-19 vaccine', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Health Services', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health education', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Housing', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'PhenX Toolkit', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Religion', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccines', 'Weighing patient', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'economic need', 'health care availability', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'literacy', 'machine learning method', 'medically underserved', 'multidisciplinary', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'skills', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'telehealth', 'testing access', 'testing uptake', 'unsupervised learning', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance', 'virtual intervention', 'virtual patient']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,10137860,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,126700
"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease. The applicant will develop strategies to identify AF patients who will best respond to each of several therapies, to guide personalized therapy.",The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation,10220109,R01HL083359,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Body Surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Right atrial structure', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,731282
"Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention Abstract Pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, more commonly known as bedsores are a huge problem affecting 2.5 million patients every year in the US and causes 60,000 deaths every year. Pressures exceeding 32 mm of Hg in the bony prominences in the back of the patient body lead to bedsores. Despite the existing low air loss mattresses, alternating pressure mattresses and the state-of-the-art air fluidized beds, bedsores prevail, and its prevention remains a huge healthcare challenge. Current hospital protocol is to turn patient every two hours. This is very disturbing and cause of pain to a resting patient who is dealing with other co-existing health conditions besides bedsores. Caregivers and nurses must turn heavy patients around, which sometimes lead to hurting their backs in the process. When not performed adequately and frequently (every 2 hours) as required, it is considered as negligence of care and causes litigation against nursing homes and hospitals causing huge financial losses to them. We propose a compliant-mechanism- based mattress that will obsolete the current clinical protocol of nurses and caregivers having to turn the patient every two hours. It will operate with minimal power, make small clicking noise when changing from one stable state to another using amount of force required to open a desk drawer. This switching of states can be further automated and can include a simple counter for documented evidence of alternating pressure to support against litigation of negligent care. In specific aim 1, machine learning using trained neural network will determine the functional requirements of the mattress (e.g., optimal amplitude and pitch for the undulation of the pressure points) by conducting a cohort pressure profile study that involves a bed that intentionally applies pressure on resting bodies. In specific aim 2, ideal topology with pitch and amplitude of undulations discovered in aim 1 will be developed using FACT and optimized using BLOT to create a prototype bi-stable compliant-mechanism-based mattress as a new approach for shifting pressure points on a patient’s body. FACT is advanced technique using freedom and constraint topologies for topology synthesis of the mattress and BLOT provides boundary layer optimization of the topology. Proposed mattress is innovative, disruptive, affordable, lightweight, does not use noisy air pumps, has no leakage issues and will eliminate the scourge of bedsores in the existing immobile and aging population. Project Narrative Numerous currently marketed alternating pressure mattresses have not received recommendations from reviewers due to poor correlation and unconvincing outcomes for bedsore prevention. Our approach of using neural network based machine learning will bring a new methodical approach to discerning the pitch and amplitude of undulations required to prevent dead pressure zones that exceed safe pressure of 32 mm of Hg on the patient’s back, which is fundamental to preventing bedsores. This will further serve as input to designing the prototype compliant-mechanism-based mattress using the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) approach and the boundary learning optimization tool (BLOT) with end effect of developing an innovative mattress for preventing bedsores in the immobile and aging population.",Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention,10138288,R41NR019721,"['Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pressure', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Body Weight', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Extravasation', 'Fatigue', 'Freedom', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Height', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injections', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mattresses', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'Negligence', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Protocols', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Recommendation', 'Rest', 'Scourge', 'Shoulder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Width', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'tool']",NINR,K MEDICAL LLC,R41,2021,251440
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,10144396,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD.

"Identification of Postoperative Pulmonary Complication Risk by Phenotyping Adult Surgical Patients who Underwent General Anesthesia with Mechanical Ventilation ABSTRACT Science: One in five patients who develop a postoperative pulmonary complication (PPC) dies within 30 days of surgery. PPCs are the second most frequent surgical complications and lead to increased admission to intensive care units, longer hospital length of stay, and high resource utilization. Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) secondary to intraoperative mechanical ventilation is a risk for PPCs. Lung protective ventilation, which entails lower tidal volume, sufficient positive end expiratory pressure, optimal inspiratory time and an alveolar recruitment maneuver, has been adopted for intraoperative use to protect pulmonary parenchyma against VILI and ultimately reduce PPC incidence. However, we still do not know the optimal ventilator parameters to yield the lowest incidence of PPCs, because what is best varies from patient to patient. Personalized ventilator parameters are a potential solution to solve this problem. A retrospective study leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) is proposed to identify PPC risks by phenotyping adult surgical patients who underwent general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Examine the incidence of PPCs in the overall study population and phenotype patients based on nonmodifiable patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics; and examine the incidence of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; (2) Determine the optimal modifiable intraoperative ventilatory parameters associated with the lowest severity of PPCs within each phenotypic subgroup; and (3) Explore machine learning algorithms for predictive models of the incidence of PPCs on patient, surgical, and anesthesia characteristics as well as intraoperative ventilator parameters. The goal of this aim is to gain knowledge and training in machine learning to lay a foundation for postdoctoral training. Training: My long-term training goal is to become a leading nurse scientist in precision health using data science to improve patient outcomes following surgery, such as reducing PPCs. To achieve this goal, I have three short-term goals during my fellowship training: (1) gain knowledge and skills in research design to enhance precision health in anesthesiology to, (2) gain knowledge in advanced analytic techniques for conducting research using big data, and (3) gain an advanced understanding of pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology that influence anesthesia and patient surgical outcomes. This fellowship will allow me protected time to reach my training goals and to build a foundation for my long-term career goals. During the next twenty-six months as a trainee, I will obtain additional training in (1) research methods and design, (2) advanced statistical methods, (3) precision health, and (4) advanced pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE This retrospective observational study leveraging electronic health records will improve our understanding of risks for lung complications after surgery that are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Knowledge gained from this study will inform development of interventions to reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and improve the surgical patients’ outcomes.",Identification of Postoperative Pulmonary Complication Risk by Phenotyping Adult Surgical Patients who Underwent General Anesthesia with Mechanical Ventilation,10311613,F31NR020128,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Age', 'Alveolar', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Applications Grants', 'Area Under Curve', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Day Surgery', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Nurses', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precision Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Respiratory System', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subcategory', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical complication', 'Techniques', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ventilator', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized care', 'personalized strategies', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'provider adherence', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'sex', 'skills', 'study population', 'supplemental oxygen', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'therapy development', 'ventilation']",NINR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,37662
"Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation therapy is one of the major approaches for cancer treatment. Treatment planning, the process of designing the optimal treatment plan for each patient, is one of the most critical steps. If a treatment is poorly designed, a satisfactory outcome cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of other treatment steps. Treatment planning in modern radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem defined by a set of hyperparameters. While there exists several quantifiable metrics to quantify plan quality and guide the planning process, these are simplified representations that cannot fully describe the physician’s intent. In addition, these metrics only measure plan quality from a population-based perspective, and cannot guide treatment planning to achieve the patient-specific best treatment plans. Hence, the best physician-preferred solution often sits in a gray area, only achievable by an extensive trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning process and interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can take up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor, if the planner is inexperienced and/or under heavy time constraints. These consequences substantially deteriorate treatment outcomes, as having been clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Recently, the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in imitation learning allows human- like decision making by observing a human expert’s actions and internally building its own decision-making system. In response to PAR-18-530, the goal of this project is to develop and translate an AI planner that mimics human experts’ behavior to generate a high quality plan. The AI planner will not replace human planners. Instead, the AI plan will be used as a starting point in the current planning process to improve plan quality and planning efficiency. The human planner’s actions on further plan improvement can feed back to the AI planner through continuous learning for its continuous evolution. We will pursue this goal using prostate cancer as the test bed through an academic-industrial partnership, jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc. The following specific aims are defined. Aim 1: Model and algorithm development. We will collect experts’ behavior data in routine treatment planning and train the AI planner. Aim 2: System validation and translation. We will integrate the AI planner into Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and validate the system in a clinically realistic setting. The innovations include the use of a state-of-the-art AI imitation learning algorithm to solve a clinically important problem, the novel technological capabilities enabled by the developed system, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end users. Deliverability is ensured by extensive preliminary studies and the partnership integrating complementary expertise and resources. Clinical translation of the AI planner will bring substantial impacts to radiotherapy by providing high-quality and efficient treatment planning to benefit patients, especially those in resource-limited regions. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes.

"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,10159301,R44HL140624,"['Acute', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Euclidean Space', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Women&apos', 's Role', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative efficacy', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'hypertension treatment', 'innovation', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,715983
"Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of hospitalization and mortality. While a number of evidence- based therapies have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with HF, nearly half of these patients are not regularly taking their medications. Although medication adherence can be improved through timely interventions, it is challenging for clinicians to accurately identify and predict medication non-adherence at the point of care. The challenge persists partly because medication adherence is a complex process influenced by an interplay of a multitude of patient-, provider-, system-, community-, and therapy-related factors. This gap in identifying patients at risk of non-adherence can be addressed through increasing availability of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs), which affords the potential to make accurate, real time predictions of adherence in HF. In particular, recent linkages of EHR and pharmacy data has created opportunity for incorporation of prior medication fills into EHR-based adherence prediction models that are updated continuously. Using machine learning (ML) techniques with such data allows for incorporation of a large number of intercorrelated risk factors and their interactions into models and for accommodating continuous updates as new information becomes available. Our objective is to build a ML-based algorithm to predict adherence among patients with HF. The specific aims are: 1) to develop supervised ML algorithms to predict medication adherence among HF patients, using EHR clinical data, linked pharmacy fill data, and location- based social determinants data from a large, urban health system that cares for a diverse patient population; 2) to assess fairness of the developed algorithms by evaluating cross-validated prediction and calibration on patient subgroups based on social and economic factors, to ensure that the desirable prediction performance is maintained for the diverse groups; and 3) to assess generalizability of the algorithms through validation in a second large, urban health system caring for a diverse population. Our approach is innovative and novel in several ways. First, we will take advantage of linkages between pharmacy fill information and the EHR to incorporate pharmacy data in our models. Second, we utilize geocoding of patient addresses combined with publicly available data to incorporate neighborhood-level social determinants of health, which are among the most important predictors of adherence, into our models. Third, we will assess fairness of the model by evaluating the predictive performance and calibration on patients from diverse backgrounds. Fourth, we will ensure generalizability of the prediction algorithm by developing it in one diverse health system and validating the algorithm in a second diverse health system. These models will be developed such that they can be used for point-of-care adherence prediction. Our long term goal is to be able to implement them into the EHR, at which point they can be incorporated into interventions to address medication adherence and, ultimately, improve both adherence and clinical outcomes for patients with HF. Project Narrative Poor medication adherence in heart failure can lead to poor health, but many clinicians are unable to determine who would benefit from interventions to address adherence. We will build machine learning models to identify patients at risk of not taking their medicines using an approach that minimizes potential biases. Electronic health record data will be used in these models, allowing them to be incorporated into interventions to improve medication adherence and reduce the disease burden of heart failure.",Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure,10095553,R01HL155149,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Development', 'Economic Factors', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Urban Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'contextual factors', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,690075
"Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease. The largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. Medication errors result in 3 million outpatient medical appointments, 1 million emergency department visits, and 125,000 hospital admissions each year. Astoundingly, over 4 billion prescriptions are dispensed every year in the United States alone. Although dispensing error rates are generally low at 0.06%, the sheer volume of dispensed medications translates to 2.4 million incorrectly dispensed medications each year. In the pharmacy, dispensing errors arise when pharmacists do not detect that the medication filled inside a prescription vial is different from the medication ordered on the prescription's label. These dispensing errors can result in patient harm, added strain on the healthcare system, and costly legal action against the pharmacy. Machine intelligence (MI) can be employed to assist in the verification process to help avoid dangerous and costly pharmacy dispensing errors.4–6 However for the human-MI partnership to function optimally, the MI should be capable of conveying accurate information that encourages providers to make sound cognitive decisions such that optimal trust is maintained, and temporal and cognitive demand is reduced. Imperative to this goal is to design MI from which interpretable information can be extracted, convey this information in an effective manner and calibrate user's trust in MI as either over-trust or under-trust can lead to near miss and incident errors. This proposed project will further our knowledge for designing interpretable MI outputs and inform the development of MI models that encourage pharmacy staff to make sound clinical decisions that lead to better patient outcomes while improving work-life at lower costs of care. This study develops interpretable MI methods in the context of medication images classification and designs effective MI advice and reasoning that lead to lower cognitive demand and increased trust in the MI. Our hypothesis is that interpretable MI will lead to improved work performance and more calibrated trust compared to uninterpretable M. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease and the largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. These dispensing errors occur approximately 2,400,000 times every year in the United States alone and can result in patient safety issues and add unnecessarily to the already strained healthcare system.The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance.",Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence,10183536,R01LM013624,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance at work', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Stream', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vial device', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical appointment', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'sound', 'support tools', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,288814
"Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis PROJECT SUMMARY This overall goal of this mentored patient-oriented research career development award is to improve our understanding of pouchitis and other inflammatory conditions after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Dr. Barnes is a motivated clinical researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), with a specific interest in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases. Over the next five years, Dr. Barnes will work with his mentorship committee to continue his progression towards his goal of independence. His mentorship committee includes experts in gastrointestinal epidemiology and comparative effectiveness (Kappelman), patient reported outcomes [(PROs) DeWalt], and precision medicine (Kosorok). Each member has an established track record of mentoring junior faculty, consistent peer-reviewed support, and high research productivity. Dr. Barnes’s career development objectives are as follows: 1) develop a new skillset in comparative effectiveness research using real-world data; 2) obtain knowledge and experience in the development of PRO assessments; 3) acquire new skills in machine learning and precision medicine principles which will allow for the incorporation of clinical and microbiota data into new risk modeling for patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA, and 4) transition to independence. To achieve his career development objectives, Dr. Barnes will participate in structured coursework, conduct mentored research, and will participate in workshops through the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, including the R-Writing Group. The research and training environment at UNC is well established. For fiscal year 2019, UNC ranked tenth among both private and public universities nationwide for National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding to domestic institutions of higher education. The specific aims of this research project are 1) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of specific biologic therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions of the pouch after IPAA; 2) to develop PRO items for evaluating quality of life and specific symptom domains among patients after IPAA. Techniques for PRO development will include identifying symptom domains relevant to patients after IPAA using qualitative research methods, selecting candidate items for IPAA-specific PROs using existing PRO instruments where appropriate, and performing cognitive interviews with patients after IPAA to ensure content validity; and 3) to demonstrate novel methods for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis using a machine learning approach. Expanding an existing prospective cohort, Dr. Barnes will utilize the stool microbiome, laboratory data and clinical variables to create signatures for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis. The combination of mentorship, didactics, and research experiences offered through this K23 proposal will allow Dr. Barnes to develop a unique skillset that will aid in his ultimate transition to independence as a clinical investigator and research scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the most common surgery for refractory ulcerative colitis and ulcerative colitis-related dysplasia, multiple complications can occur. Short and long-term complications include inflammatory conditions of the pouch such as acute and chronic pouchitis and Crohn’s-like disease of the pouch, each of which can require new medical treatments after surgery and can significantly impact the quality of life of individual patients. This mentored patient-oriented research career development project will generate evidence about the comparative effectiveness of therapies for the treatment of these inflammatory conditions of the pouch, will develop new IPAA-specific patient-reported assessments of pouch symptoms and quality of life, and will utilize precision medicine techniques including machine learning to identify patients at high-risk for developing chronic pouchitis.",Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis,10103883,K23DK127157,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colectomy', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Counseling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Crowding', 'Curative Surgery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysplasia', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Ileal Reservoirs', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pouchitis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Restorative Proctocolectomy', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cognitive interview', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'effectiveness study', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'higher education', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented research', 'precision medicine', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K23,2021,200052
"Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, LDs take on a higher risk of future ESKD themselves. African American (AA) LDs have an even greater, 3.3-fold, risk of ESKD than white LDs post-donation. Because evidence suggests that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using APOL1 testing to evaluate LD candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic counseling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counseling about APOL1. Without proper counseling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, jeopardizing their informed consent. Given their elevated risk of ESRD post-donation, and AAs’ widely-held cultural concerns about genetic testing, it is ethically critical to protect AA LD candidates’ safety through APOL1 testing in a culturally competent manner to improve informed decisions about donating.  No transplant programs have integrated APOL1 testing into LD evaluation in a culturally competent manner. Clinical “chatbots,” mobile apps that use artificial intelligence to provide genetic information to patients and relieve constraints on clinicians’ time, can improve informed treatment decisions and reduce decisional conflict. The chatbot “Gia,” created by a medical genetics company, can be adapted to any condition. However, no chatbot on APOL1 is currently available. No counseling training programs are available for nephrologists to counsel AA LDs about APOL1 and donation in a culturally competent manner. Given the shortage of genetic counselors, increasing nephrologists’ genetic literacy is critical to integrating genetic testing into practice.  The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of an APOL1 testing program for AA LDs at two transplant centers serving large AA LD populations (Chicago, IL, and Washington, DC). The APOL1 testing program will evaluate the effect of the culturally competent testing, chatbot, and counseling on AA LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate, and satisfaction with informed consent. The specific aims are to: 1. Adapt Gia and transplant counseling to APOL1 for use in routine clinical practice 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on decisional conflict, preparedness, and willingness to  donate in a pre-post design 3. Evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice by using the RE-AIM framework to  longitudinally evaluate nephrologist counseling practices and LDs’ satisfaction with informed consent.  The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for APOL1 testing of AA LDs, which can then be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other practices to improve patient informed consent. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants may contribute to African American living kidney donors’ even greater (3.3-fold) risk of end-stage renal disease post-donation than white living kidney donors. However, transplant physicians do not consistently use APOL1 genetic testing or counsel African American living donor candidates about APOL1, which may undermine candidates’ ability to give informed consent about donating and exacerbate health disparities in living donation and transplantation. By evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program, the proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly scale up APOL1 testing nationally as a novel and ethical approach to protect African American living donors’ safety and enhance their informed consent.",Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation,10180256,R01DK128207,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Altruism', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioethics', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Living Donors', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Readiness', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'chatbot', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'implementation intervention', 'implementation outcomes', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'literacy', 'living kidney donor', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'success', 'transplant centers', 'willingness']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,714612
"Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers ABSTRACT Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (PwADRD). Fall costs are expected to reach $67.7 billion this year and add to family caregiver (CG) burden. Injurious falls are a frequent reason people are unable to remain at home, resulting in significantly increased care costs to the family and society.  Most FP efforts fail to address understanding fall risks or changing behavior. In response to NIA requests for ‘Care technology to sustain in-home living, preserve function and promote effective communication’, an innovative falls prevention intervention for use by CGs of PwADRD living at home who are classified as at moderate to high fall risk for falls will be developed and tested. Goal: Develop FallScape for Dementia (FS-D), an innovative CG-provided daily treatment utilizing proprietary multimedia and behavioral intervention methods to facilitate communication and encourage FP behaviors that will reduce PwADRD falls.  The rigorous Phase 1 research plan will: a) develop a FS-D prototype that includes CG training software, multimedia and support tools to customize, conduct and review progress in daily CG-provided Mm sessions; b) Perform pilot testing and c) conduct a mixed methods preliminary clinical trial. Specific Aims and milestones/deliverables are: a) Develop prototype; i. Produce multimedia assets; ii. Craft Customization; iii. Artificial Intelligence algorithms; iv. Create CG training/daily administration tools. b) Pilot test prototype. i. Recruit 12 Dyads representing PwD diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy- body and Parkinson’s disease dementias. ii. Test CG ease of use and acceptability; iii. Examine customization for CG and dementia sub-types; iv. Evaluate relevance and dyad engagement. c) Conduct Preliminary Clinical Trial. 1. Recruit and enroll 25 Dyads; 2. Provide study components: initial; one-month FS-D intervention and a Follow-up; 3. Follow Dyads for 6 months; 4. Analyze outcomes and disseminate results.  FS-D will offer a rare opportunity to empower both CG and PwADRD by breaking the frustrating cycle of failure to recognize fall threats or change behavior and may mitigate CG burden. FS-D is an urgently needed falls prevention intervention for family CG use. The economic and quality of life benefits of sustaining in-home living for PwADRD by preventing falls will accrue to all stakeholders for this large, high-risk population. Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related Dementias (PwADRD) and the family caregiver (CG) is uniquely positioned to provide a positive daily interaction with the PwADRD in order to improve recognition of personal fall risks, encourage falls prevention behaviors and reduce falls. The proposed product FallScape- Dementia will develop and test a system for daily CG use in which Artificial Intelligence algorithms will guide the CG and customize the daily sessions. Reduction of falls will help the PwADRD to remain at home, reducing family and public health costs.",Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers,10260652,R43AG071360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Balance training', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Blood Vessels', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Failure', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family health status', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Long-Term Care', 'Los Angeles', 'Methods', 'Multimedia', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Administration', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'behavior change', 'care costs', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'fall injury', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'response', 'strength training', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIA,BROOKSIDE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT COMPANY,R43,2021,246663
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,10135919,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data repository', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'excessive weight gain', 'feasibility testing', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2021,139614
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE. However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity. There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions, has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside. We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2) Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections. MAESTRA Project Narrative Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs when a baby gets reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, and can lead to death or long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy. During labor and delivery, doctors are able to continuously record the heart rate of the fetus. This study will determine how best to use the heart rate information so that we can reduce the number of infants who develop this severe brain condition.",Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA),10145055,R01HD099216,"['Acidosis', 'Address', 'Apgar Score', 'Asphyxia', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'California', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cesarean section', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Educational workshop', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Heart Rate', 'Infant', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metabolic Brain Diseases', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Brain Injury', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal anoxic ischemic brain injury', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'falls', 'fetal', 'fetus at risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'routine care', 'signal processing', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'uterine contractility']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,566881
"A Geometric and Morphoelastic Study of Aortic Dissection Evolution Project Summary/Abstract: The natural evolution of aortic dissection is notoriously unpredictable under current methods of evaluation and management. There is an urgent need to more completely elucidate the biomechanical stability of type B aortic dissections and identify signatures in the imaging data allowing for optimal patient classification based on aortic fragility. The long-term goal is the development and validation of image-based analysis algorithms to classify aortic stability and allow a personalized risk stratification for a given patient’s aortic geometry providing the basis for optimizing clinical management. The overall objective of this proposal is to utilize modern approaches in differential geometry, continuum mechanics, and computer vision to discover and characterize high-risk geometric structures hidden within computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of fragile aortas. The central hypothesis of this application is the existence of a fundamental link between aortic shape and aortic stability as it relates to the risk of aortic dissection and fragility. The rationale for this work is development of an easily translatable geometry and mechanics-based algorithm to predict dissection stability and intervention timing by discovering a richer and more nuanced mapping of aortic shapes hidden in existing patient imaging data. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) develop a modern geometric classification for aortic shapes, 2) develop a computational model that provides the mechanism underpinning the shape evolution of aortic dissections, and 3) develop a modern successor to the traditional ‘maximum diameter’ measure of aortic dissections that integrates geometric, finite element, and physiologic factors. Utilizing a large pre-identified CTA data set of normal and dissected aortas at various stages of disease and intervention, aim 1 will use tools from computer vision to reduce aortic shape to distributions of shape index and curvedness. Aim 2 will utilize advanced morphoelastic finite element growth models to discover the biomechanical mechanism underpinning aortic shape changes in aortic dissections and validate these models on patient specific geometries over clinically relevant time periods. These novel shape and mechanical stability classifiers will be used in both linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction methods to define aortic shape sub-spaces for different clinical scenarios in aim 3. This proposal is innovative as it challenges the status quo of evaluation and treatment by deploying novel measures and techniques that analyze clinically relevant aortic geometry and the evolution of aortic shape. Every patient is taken to the operating room under the full intent of having a positive clinical outcome. The research outlined is significant because it is expected to provide surgeons and patients a more discriminative framework with which to make better informed management decisions concerning type B aortic dissections and ultimately optimize outcomes. Project Narrative: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it seeks to inform upon the potential benefits of surgical versus medical intervention for type B aortic dissection through the development of modern geometric and mechanistically based selection criteria. Upon completion there will be a richer and more nuanced understanding of aortic stability as defined from computed tomography angiography imaging, which will allow for more optimal patient selection. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH’s mission to enhance cardiovascular health and improve mortality.",A Geometric and Morphoelastic Study of Aortic Dissection Evolution,10280305,R01HL159205,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Aorta', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'blood pressure variability', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'differential geometry', 'geometric structure', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'preservation', 'risk stratification', 'simulation', 'surgical risk', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,459189
"Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission” (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression,10129431,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proteostasis', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R01,2021,490569
"Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises Project summary: Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems. This leads to at least 16 million cases of acute gastroenteritis directly linked to pollution at community water systems, with tens of millions more directly impacted by chemical and organic pollutants. Impacts are further exacerbated in locations dealing with water scarcity, in under-served populations, and within other vulnerable populations already suffering from health disparities. Many of these water problems are the direct result of managerial negligence, inconsistent monitoring, and a lack of the ability to anticipate where problems may arise next. While the reasons for drinking water problems are complex, if we could anticipate where health-based drinking water problems were to occur in the future, it could have an immediate and positive impact on tens of millions of Americans annually. Interestingly, extensive data about water quality and the performance of municipal water systems already exists in large, disparate databases. These databases are largely ignored and, when used, are typically used only anecdotally and retroactively. Preliminary evidence suggests that these existing databases, which contain histories of administrative violations and sub-threshold water-quality results, can be mined to accurately predict future drinking water crises. The Superior Statistical Research R&D team is an internationally recognized group of water experts with cross-cutting expertise in statistics/data analysis/modelling/computing, water-quality monitoring of biological and chemical contaminants, and the ability to clearly and compellingly translate water-quality and health information to actionable steps for individuals, organizations and communities. In this Phase I project, we will show that it is possible to predict water-related, health-based problem areas utilizing already collected, historical data on water quality and municipal water system performance. We will begin by harmonizing the disparate water quality and municipal water system performance in two different states (Michigan and Iowa). We will then utilize machine-learning techniques to predict health-based violation histories and will evaluate our methods by comparing predicted violations to actual health-based violations in the previous 5 years. Finally, we will identify at least 10 municipalities determined by our algorithm to be at the highest risk for future health- based water problems and will do systematic sampling to confirm our model-based predictions. We will then demonstrate how making these predictions can be leveraged to profitability by exploring how our model-based predictions can be presented to customers in an economical, usable form. Proof of our concept and profitability models in two states (Phase I) will set us up for widespread (multi-state) database harmonization and improvement of the proposed machine-learning/modelling effort in Phase II. With multi-state harmonized datasets, identification of key data gaps in particular states/areas, and proven financial models, our technology will ultimately lead to dramatic reductions in the number of health-based drinking water problems annually. Project Narrative Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems, but predicting where and when these health-based drinking water problems will occur remains a large and complex obstacle. Current approaches focus on a reactive approach to health-based water-quality violations in community water systems, rather than a proactive one that seeks to anticipate where problems will occur in the future. The overall goal of this project is to leverage large and disparate historical datasets of water quality to accurately predict locations of future health-based water-quality violations, validate the predictions, and commercialize our proprietary predictions as a practical and cost-saving approach to anticipating and heading off future health-based water problems.",Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises,10253600,R43ES033134,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Chemicals', 'Cities', 'Coal', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complex', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Filtration', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Lead', 'Lead levels', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Negligence', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pollution', 'Price', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Serinus', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Water', 'advocacy organizations', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'drinking water', 'economic impact', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'member', 'pollutant', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'rural area', 'statistics', 'water quality', 'water sampling', 'water testing', 'willingness to pay']",NIEHS,"SUPERIOR STATISTICAL RESEARCH, LLC",R43,2021,256579
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam.

"Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) 30-day readmissions generate over a third of HF healthcare costs in the US and are the leading cause of US 30-day readmissions. Drivers of HF readmissions include increasing complexity associated with clinical, social, and behavioral factors. Despite numerous interventions, readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these could be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach promoting better connections to and communication with clinical care teams while addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care. Community health workers (CHWs) are members of medical teams who address social, behavioral, and basic clinical factors influencing health outcomes while fostering patient connections to and communication with care teams. CHW care is one of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. However, CHW care relies on intensive 1:1 patient care models that do not leverage technology which limits efficiency and scalability. There has been limited attention on developing technology-based interventions in CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. A HF mobile phone application-based digital platform that utilizes artificial intelligence driven biometric data to minimize false alarms, promotes early identification of true decline, and encourages communication with providers was developed in 2016 to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Preliminary clinical trial data for the digital platform has been promising. A prototype designed for patients with HF and the CHWs caring for them has recently been created. The current proposal will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Aim 1: Identify behavioral (e.g., diet, activity) and social (e.g., socioeconomic status, social supports, living situation) factors that influence HF outcomes relevant to a digitally-enabled CHW intervention by performing semi-structured interviews with 30 patients with HF and 20 CHWs. Aim 2: Test usability of a digitally- enabled CHW intervention (focused on CHW workflow integration) in 10 patients with HF in an open pilot trial. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a digitally-enabled CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions within a pilot RCT (n=50). The candidate’s overall career goals are: to identify social and behavioral drivers of HF/cardiovascular clinical outcomes; to develop expertise in qualitative methods, behavioral science, and RCTs; and ultimately, to develop interventions that improve care and reduce costs in HF/cardiovascular disease and other NHLBI diseases seen by generalists. This training plan includes strong mentorship, formal coursework, and scientific meetings with cohesive training in behavioral and social sciences, qualitative research, and the conduction of RCTs. This proposal investigates a potentially transformative intervention that addresses important gaps in the literature by assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention in reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement. Project Narrative: Despite ongoing efforts to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality and elevated healthcare costs, 30-day HF readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these are preventable. Community health worker (CHW) care delivery has been shown to improve healthcare outcomes but inefficiency limits its scalability. Implementation of a 30-day digitally-enabled CHW intervention for HF patients may provide support for similar interventions in larger HF/cardiovascular populations by reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement.",Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure,10084315,K23HL150287,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Community Health Aides', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Research', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Team', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Singapore', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinical care', 'cohesion', 'comorbidity', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'health difference', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'pilot trial', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'readmission rates', 'social', 'social factors', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,198857

"Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy Project Summary  Radiotherapy (RT) aims to deliver tumoricidal dose to clinical target volume (CTV) while sparing organs at risk (OAR), for which proton and photon beams are naturally complementary to each other: protons are generally better for OAR sparing, while photons are more robust to delivery uncertainties for CTV coverage. The hybrid proton-photon RT has a long history. However, as it generates proton and photon plans separately without fully utilizing joint proton-photon optimization during the planning stage, current hybrid RT is pseudo- hybrid and very limited in plan quality, treatment sites, and broad applicability. The key to leapfrog from pseudo-hybrid to truly-hybrid RT is new joint proton-photon optimization method that synergizes complementary proton and photon beams. The hypothesis is that truly-hybrid RT via appropriate joint proton- photon optimization will be more favorable than proton or photon-only RT, in terms of CTV coverage robustness and OAR sparing optimality.  Broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT to patients: (A) Clinical applicability: unlike pseudo-hybrid RT that is limited in plan quality and treatment sites, truly-hybrid RT may become a new paradigm for general cancer RT, owing to its superior plan quality and thus potentially clinical outcomes to proton-only or photon-only RT. (B) Clinical workflow: our truly-hybrid plans can be individually and safely delivered on existing proton and photon machines, and this effort envisions patients being treated in an integrated cancer center like ours with both proton and photon equipment, under the direction of a single physician, using shared immobilization devices, simulation procedure and structure set, and integrated treatment planning and delivery system. (C) Patient coverage: truly-hybrid RT can be made broadly available to many cancer patients through existing infrastructures in US, since (1) most hospitals with proton centers also have photon centers; (2) 76% of cancer patients live in the states with operational proton centers, while 85% are within 100-mile (2-hour-driving) distances to these proton centers; (3) cancer patients are more willing to travel for advanced treatment options.  Proposed effort: Inspired by unprecedented plan quality and broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT via our joint proton-photon optimization method, the next step is to test the hypothesis prospectively via clinical trials. However, a missing prerequisite to advance truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic is a treatment planning system (TPS) that can generate clinically-deliverable hybrid plans. To meet this urgent need, this effort will develop novel optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT, which is a radical step towards prospective clinical trials for testing the hypothesis.  Aim 1: Optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT.  Aim 2: Optimization methods for accurate and efficient MCO truly-hybrid planning.  Aim 3: Deep learning based optimization methods for efficient truly-hybrid planning. Project Narrative  This project will develop truly-”2D” proton-photon joint optimization methods for clinically-deliverable truly- hybrid RT with unprecedented superior plan quality to proton-only and photon-only RT, and first-of-its-kind TPS to bridge truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic. This hybrid TPS can facilitate prospective clinical trials of a broad spectrum of treatment sites for many patients. If succeed, truly-hybrid RT via this first-of-its-kind TPS will likely warrant improved clinical outcomes with reduced OAR toxicities, and potentially become a new paradigm for cancer RT in general, with compelling benefits in both treatment cost and clinical outcomes.",Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy,10207870,R37CA250921,"['Automobile Driving', 'Bathing', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Equipment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Immobilization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiotherapy Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Travel', 'Treatment Cost', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'clinical application', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment site']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,356850
"When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases lead to profound cognitive, emotional, and functional impairments. As these diseases progress, the person with dementia (PWD) becomes increasingly dependent on a caregiver for functional, psychological, and economic assistance. It is well-documented that caring for a PWD is associated with considerable declines in health and well-being. Evidence suggests that many caregivers continue to experience these adverse effects for years after caregiving has ended (after the death of the PWD), though this area has received less attention. There is also striking variability in the extent to which caregivers experience these consequences – both during caregiving and after it has ended. Research on the sources of these individual differences has largely focused on factors related to the external environment, the PWD, or the caregiver that contribute to increased vulnerability in caregivers. Although research has linked PWD-caregiver relationship quality with declines in caregiver well-being, little is known about the specific interpersonal mechanisms that contribute to caregiver outcomes. For example, the positive emotional qualities of the PWD-caregiver social connection may buffer against the negative effects of caregiving stress, whereas lower quality social connection may drive increases in caregivers’ loneliness. In the proposed research, I will measure PWD-caregiver social connection through observational measures derived from basic affective science, including dyadic coding of emotional behavior in a laboratory-based interaction between PWDs and caregivers (Study 1; N = 186) and text analysis of emotional language caregivers used when describing a recent time they felt connected to the PWD (Study 2; N = 533). I will then determine the impact of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being (Aim 1), both concurrently (in current caregivers) and longitudinally (in former caregivers, after caregiving has ended). Additionally, I will compare the relative strength of these associations between current and former caregivers, and I will investigate possible mechanisms (e.g., loneliness) through which PWD-caregiver social connection is linked to caregivers’ health and well-being. I will then evaluate the predictive value of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being, above and beyond an optimal set of predictors identified through machine learning (Aim 2). The proposed dissertation research will prepare me to conduct future studies investigating the socioemotional mechanisms that may influence caregivers’ health trajectories. This F31 will provide the necessary support to accomplish the following research goals: (1) to further expertise in basic affective science methodologies (e.g., dyadic behavioral coding, text analysis); (2) to achieve advanced proficiency in statistical techniques for longitudinal and machine learning analyses; and (3) to enhance knowledge of neurodegenerative disease, including neuropsychology and differential diagnosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dementia and other neurodegenerative disease are progressive, debilitating illnesses that require assistance from loved ones serving as caregivers. Caring for a person with dementia is associated with significantly heightened risk for adverse consequences, such as reduced health and well-being, which may persist for years after caregiving has ended. Identifying mechanisms that convey risk for the long-term adverse effects of caregiving can facilitate developing more effective interventions with major public health benefits.",When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being,10235400,F31AG072891,"['Accounting', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affective', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Caregiver well-being', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ecosystem', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care giving burden', 'caregiving', 'dementia caregiving', 'effective intervention', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'loved ones', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'social', 'social relationships']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,46036
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),10105371,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,514581
"PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) Project Summary The objective of PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) is to discover novel biomarker signatures of post cardiac arrest brain and extracerebral organ failure that predict treatment responsiveness and long-term recovery. We will achieve this by partnering with the ICECAP trial, a response-adaptive dose finding clinical research trial that seeks to determine the optimal duration of post-arrest hypothermia. Cardiac arrest is a major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Four in five patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest have significant brain injury, and death from neurologic damage is common. Improving survival and functional recovery is a critical public health objective and will require innovative approaches. The current clinical situation is unprecedented. Currently post-CA brain injury is an acute, sudden critical illness with major knowledge gaps about how best to characterize severity of injury and to identify which individual patients are likely to benefit from specific neuroprotective strategies. Thus, development of high- performing biomarker signatures is a critical need and would translate in to immediate changes in care. We hypothesize that not all patients are identical (i.e. there will be a heterogeneity of treatment effect) and that through our innovative, multi-parametric data driven approach, we will be able to identify novel signatures that define subgroups of patients. Advanced data science and analytical approaches will allow the identification of these subgroups that was previously not possible. These subgroups will be clinically important insofar as they will indicate differential responses to treatment and different trajectories of functional recovery. This project will acquire high resolution multi-modal data early in the disease course that will allow us to address these current knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the disease in the early acute setting when interventions can improve outcome. The knowledge learned here will be applied to develop personalized treatments for cardiac arrest survivors, addressing the NIH's and our goals of lengthening life and reducing disability. Project Narrative Post-cardiac arrest injury affects the brain and other critical organs and is a major public health problem causing significant death and disability. This project will use novel data-driven approaches to collect high resolution monitoring data from patients in the critical care unit and will use that multi-parametric data to develop newly defined patient sub-groups with differing clinical trajectories and responses to therapies. This project will have a major impact on public health by allowing treatment of the right patient at the right time with the right therapy, thereby reducing disability and saving lives.",PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP),10099869,R01NS119825,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Death', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiopulmonary Physiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Neurosciences', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pupil light reflex', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rewarming', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'natural hypothermia', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1648754
"Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy PROJECT SUMMARY Injury is the most common cause of death in people younger than 46 years of age, and bleeding after injury is the most common cause of preventable death. Treatment of bleeding requires timely procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. Hospitals that specialize in treating injury have protocols, medications, devices and clinical staff available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Injured people treated at specialized hospitals are more likely to live. However, there are far too many injured people every year than can be treated at specialized hospitals so minor injuries are cared for at hospitals not specialized in treating injuries. Severely injured people are taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries when specialized hospitals are too far away, or the emergency medical personnel underestimate how seriously injured someone is. Hospitals not specialized in treating injuries do not participate in ongoing injury clinical trials, regional data registries nor national quality improvement programs, and as a result what happens there that leads to people bleeding to death is unknown. This application's long-term objective is to improve the timeliness of treatment of bleeding after injury. The Specific Aims will be to: 1) understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in treating injuries; 2) identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment; and3) determine how to improve the timeliness of treatment. The central hypothesis is that treatment of bleeding is not standardized in hospitals not specialized in treating injuries and leads to a delay in transferring injured people to specialized hospitals. Identifying modifiable healthcare system, hospital, and patient factors can inform the design of a systematic process to quickly temporarily stabalize bleeding of injured people initially at non-specialized centers then expedite transfer to specialized hospitals by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals. This will ensure that people who are bleeding after injury are cared for at the right place at the right time. Ultimately, the right treatment at the right time will give people initially taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries the same chance at life as those taken to specialized hospitals. As a Career Development Award, the proposed training plan will include training in data science, systems engineering and design. The methods to be learned and employed will be machine learning, failure mode, effects and criticality analysis and user-centered design. The health relatedness of the project is to understand current practice management of bleeding after injury, in order to improve the timeliness of bleeding treatments to enhance the health of injured inviduals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injury is the most common cause of death in people under 46 years old with more than 200,000 Americans dying annually. Bleeding accounts for 30% of deaths after injury, most of which are preventable if patients receive timely bleeding treatments including procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. The proposed resarch will understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in injury care, identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment, and then create an improved systematic process by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals caring for injured people.",Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy,10203288,K23HL157832,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Area', 'Bleeding time procedure', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Devices', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Practice Management', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Special Hospitals', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Work', 'blood product', 'clinical care', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'design', 'engineering design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'mortality', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'programs', 'prototype', 'severe injury', 'standardized care', 'stroke patient', 'supervised learning', 'time use', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K23,2021,190279
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,10188627,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'structured data', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,177788
"1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk,10122994,R01MH120090,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,583239

"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots - Summer Undergraduate Support Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology. Characterization of such clusters will enable public health departments and policy makers in targeted surveillance of their regions and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources. Project Narrative  This project will develop a new methodology to quantify the potential risks of under-vaccinated spatial clusters for highly infectious diseases. It will rank the clusters based on their economic and epidemic burden which will enable public health ofﬁcials in targeted surveillance and interventions, to mitigate their risk.",Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots - Summer Undergraduate Support,10393815,R01GM109718,"['Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Clusterings', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'High Performance Computing', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'novel', 'provider networks', 'statistics', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,11253
