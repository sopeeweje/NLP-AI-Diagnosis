"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry. This new technology will contribute to understanding complex processes in biological tissues that play a role in both health and disease.",Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry,10219212,UH3CA255132,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Blood capillaries', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Ensure', 'Glass', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slide', 'Solvents', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated analysis', 'biological systems', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'interest', 'ionization technique', 'lipidomics', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'nano', 'nanoprobe', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'preservation', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,UH3,2021,620000
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity. We propose to commercialize a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscope to enable non-invasive, high-definition, wide field of view imaging in 3D for eye banks.","High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging",10172909,R44EY028827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Blindness', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Viability Process', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient imaging', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rights', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'commercial application', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo regeneration', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'trend']",NEI,LIGHTOPTECH CORPORATION,R44,2021,741958
"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong. This work will help physicians time the administration of chemotherapy and will allow researchers to better understand how cancer physiology changes with time-of-day",Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy,10130460,R01CA227485,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptotic', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronotherapy', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Side Effects', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Transport', 'Drug toxicity', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Intestines', 'Islet Cell Tumor', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms', 'New Agents', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phase', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Recommendation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Stomach', 'Streptozocin', 'Structure', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'circadian', 'circadian pacemaker', 'clinically significant', 'dosage', 'experience', 'gene product', 'human data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'reconstruction', 'side effect', 'transcriptome', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,599614
"Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  A major challenge in the management of advanced ovarian cancer is the presence of disseminated microscopic tumor nodules within the intraperitoneal cavity. Despite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, as many as 50% of patients can show occult disseminated disease, with only a 43% survival rate. Furthermore, systemic chemotherapy can have toxic side effects. Thus, recent efforts have aimed at improving detection and treatment of micromets. Chemophototherapy (CPT), the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, is an emerging cancer treatment modality that can provide synergistic efficacy of both therapies. The overall goal is to implement a quantitative laparoscopic imaging and treatment approach for advanced detection of micromets and optimization of CPT for targeted destruction of ovarian micromets and reduced toxic side effects. Quantitative fluorescence laparoscopic imaging will provide high sensitivity and resolution for detecting micromets as well as image guided drug delivery. Folate receptor alpha (FA) will be used as a promising target because it is highly specific of epithelial ovarian cancer. The proposed targeted CPT compound has a ~6-fold tumor-specificity providing enhanced fluorescence contrast. These folate-targeted, porphyrin-phospholipid doped liposomes are triggered directly by near infrared (NIR) light. This activates the anti-cancer photosensitizer outer layer and releases the anti-cancer agent Doxorubicin (Dox). While this nanocarrier is expected to improve detection of micromets, tissue absorption and scattering in living tissue can confound fluorescence contrast. Quantitative imaging based on spatial frequency domain imaging can eliminate these confounding effects and provide quantitative contrasts to enable more sensitive detection compared to raw fluorescence or white light visualization. Furthermore, this quantitative capability can function in near-real-time to provide feedback on drug release, thus allowing image-guided optimization of treatment light to ensure full drug release within each tumor. In Aim 1, a wide-field dual-channel laparoscope, fast quantification algorithms and targeted liposomal nano-construct will be implemented and optimized. In Aim 2, the platform will be validated in vivo for improved detection of micromets vs. raw fluorescence and white light. In Aim 3, the platform’s efficacy will be validated in vivo for destroying micromets in targeted tumors while reducing toxicity to surrounding normal tissues. Successful completion of this approach is expected to result in improved detection and treatment of micromets with reduced side effects. This is ultimately expected to lead to reduced recurrence rates and overall improved survival. Although this imaging approach focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment, it can be applicable to a wide range of epithelial diseases, such as oral, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. NARRATIVE A quantitative laparoscopic spatial frequency domain imaging platform is proposed to map intraperitoneal ovarian metastases as well as to treat them effectively via targeted chemo-photo therapy. Cancer-targeting drug and optimized light delivery will allow local release and preferential uptake of the drug into tumors versus normal tissue for optimal cancer cell destruction with minimal side effects to the surrounding normal tissue. This approach is relevant to public health as it is expected to significantly improve detection and destruction of micromets in ovarian cancer patients, and reduce side effects in normal tissue, thereby fulfilling the overarching goal of improving patients’ survival rates and quality of life.",Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases,10219200,R01CA243164,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biodistribution', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'FOLR1 gene', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Folic Acid', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Laparoscopes', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Liposomal Doxorubicin', 'Liposomes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm to the Ovary', 'Micrometastasis', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodule', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian Carcinoma', 'PUVA Photochemotherapy', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phospholipids', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Phototherapy', 'Physiological', 'Platinum', 'Porphyrins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'anti-cancer', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'contrast enhanced', 'controlled release', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided drug delivery', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'intraperitoneal', 'liposome vector', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'nano', 'nanocarrier', 'nanomedicine', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'phantom model', 'quantitative imaging', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity', 'uptake']",NCI,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,336645
"Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies ABSTRACT: Endometriosis is a chronic pathologic condition that affects approximately 176 million worldwide, and can cause severe abdominal pain and subfertility. Despite its prevalence, there is currently no widely accepted theory of pathogenesis for endometriosis. Further, there are currently no clinical biomarkers for non- invasive diagnosis as most patients are only diagnosed at the time of exploratory laparoscopy. Thus, application of new molecular technologies to advance the understanding, diagnosis, and intraoperative detection of endometriosis is critically needed to improve patient care and management. Ambient mass spectrometry (MS) techniques offer the chemical specificity and sensitivity to perform rapid and in-depth molecular analysis of unprocessed tissue samples. We propose to conduct a rigorous study applying MS techniques in conjunction with statistical methods to identify, characterize, and validate metabolic and protein markers of endometrial and endometriosis tissues correlated to patient symptoms and disease presentation. Further, we propose to evaluate the performance of ambient MS techniques as tools for rapid diagnosis of endometrial tissues, and in vivo intraoperative disease detection. Combining our team’s expertise in MS, statistics, gynecological surgery, pathology and endometriosis, we are unique poised to successfully carry out the following proposed aims: Aim 1. Characterize metabolic and proteomic markers of endometriosis tissues from endometriosis patients using MS imaging. Characterization of molecular markers that are specific to endometriosis lesions within tissue microenvironment can lead to new understanding of the biological mechanisms governing endometriosis development and pinpoint potential targets for treatment. Using a large cohort of tissues prospectively collected from surgeries, we will use MS imaging and statistical analysis to identify molecular signatures of endometriosis tissues and uncover significant molecular alterations correlated to patient phenotypes and disease presentation within controlled patient subgroups. Aim 2. Define diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissues from endometriosis and unaffected patients. New methods for accurate and rapid diagnosis endometriosis are critically needed to advance patient care. We propose to use MS imaging and statistical analyses to identify diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissue samples obtained from eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients, and endometrium tissues from unaffected patients undergoing other benign gynecological procedures, with the goal of identifying molecular markers that could use for diagnosis of endometriosis from tissue biopsies. Aim 3. Test the MasSpec Pen as an intraoperative tool for in vivo endometriosis detection. Complete excision of endometriosis lesions and preservation of healthy adjacent tissues is of utmost importance in the surgical treatment of patients. We propose to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the performance of MasSpec Pen technology for in vivo detection of endometriosis lesions and surgical guidance in laparoscopic procedures. Narrative  We propose to develop and use mass spectrometry technologies in conjunction with statistical methods to better understand, detect, and diagnose endometriosis. By leveraging the advantages of the chemical sensitivity and specificity of mass spectrometry with the simplicity, speed, and spatial correlation offered by ambient mass spectrometry techniques, we aim to develop new methods that can improve the diagnosis and management of endometriosis at multiple stages of patient treatment using a large cohort of patient samples. The experiments proposed will explore the molecular differences between eutopic and ectopic endometrium tissues, correlate molecular data with patient phenotypes and disease presentation, advance development of a diagnostic method for endometriosis, and improve the surgical resection of endometriosis lesions in vivo during surgical procedures, leading to new understanding of this disease and offering improved treatment options for patients.",Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies,10219741,R01HD101560,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Endometrial', 'Endometrium', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic Surgical Procedures', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Laparoscopy', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'endometriosis', 'eutopic endometrium', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in situ imaging', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'ionization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'new technology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient subsets', 'predictive signature', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'rapid diagnosis', 'rapid technique', 'reproductive', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'subfertility', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,205035
"Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Sensing for Real-time Intraoperative Surgical Margin Assessment ABSTRACT The primary objective of surgical therapy for the treatment of patients with cancer is to remove all cancer cells from within the body, with the secondary objective of maintaining organ function. The primary pathological metric used to rate the success of a surgical procedure is evaluation of the surgical margin of the resected tissue specimen, post-operatively. This typically involves cutting the tissue into sections and microscopically exploring these tissue samples for the presence of cancer cells at the margins. Cancer cells noted at the margins represent Positive Surgical Margins (PSMs) and suggest that cancer cells were left in the body following the procedure. As a result, patients with PSMs are often exposed to noxious additional procedures to eradicate the cancer cells left behind including radiation, chemical, hormonal, and additional surgical therapy; these all have adverse morbidities that decrease a patient's quality of life. No clinical protocols are routinely used to intraoperatively assess surgical margin status during surgical procedures. Instead, margins are evaluated through microscopic assessment of the tissue following the procedure, when it is too late to provide additional surgical intervention. We aim to develop an intraoperative device able to assess surgical margin status so that the surgeons can extract additional tissues in real-time and ultimately decrease the rates of PSMs. While our technology can be applied for most cancer surgeries, we are focusing our efforts on prostate cancer as these are the highest incidence and cause of death for men and because patients with PSMs following these procedures have a much higher rate of recurrence than patients that have negative surgical margins. We have previously shown that the electrical impedance (a property that describes how easily electrical current passes through a tissue) of tissue is sensitive to a tissue's cellular arrangement and can be used to distinguish cancer from benign tissue in prostate. We have developed a prototype flexible endoscopic device capable of imaging the electrical impedance tissue during radical prostatectomy procedures using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) techniques. This device makes focal measurements of margin status. Here we aim to take the significant step of constructing an optimized EIT device that can be deployed laparoscopically (e.g. prostate surgery) to provide an accurate method of intraoperatively identifying positive surgical margins. We aim to develop this device, develop intraoperative visualization strategies to help guide surgeons, evaluate the technology in an in vivo study, and validate the technology intraoperatively. By the end of this program we intend to have developed a low-cost, single use probe that can be deployed in a multi- center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of this technology for intraoperative surgical margin assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gauging electrical properties of surgical margins during tumor resection procedures has the potential to alert surgeons to regions of cancer not fully extracted and subsequently reduce the number of positive surgical margins which are significantly correlated with cancer recurrence. The intraoperative electrical property sensing/imaging probe and the visualization tools proposed here will provide an accurate, rapid, and cost- effective method for gauging these surgical margins for multiple cancer types. We will explore this technology in the context of prostate cancer surgery with the expectation that this will further advance the study of electrical property signatures of normal and diseased tissue in vivo and help to translate this technology to the clinic.",Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Sensing for Real-time Intraoperative Surgical Margin Assessment,10218115,R01CA237654,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bladder Control', 'Breast', 'Cancerous', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Erectile dysfunction', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Histopathology', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Incontinence', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nephrectomy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pelvic floor structure', 'Periprostatic', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Resected', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Urethra', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer surgery', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'electric impedance', 'electrical impedance tomography', 'electrical property', 'expectation', 'feasibility trial', 'flexibility', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'man', 'men', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'programs', 'prostate surgery', 'prototype', 'safety and feasibility', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'urinary bladder neck']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,478142
"Dynamic µOCT for cellular tissue phenotyping Phenotyping cells and tissue is a critical function that spans basic science to clinical diagnosis. Yet, established methods for phenotyping cells in tissue are static, are evaluated when the tissue is dead, and typically involve destruction of the sample. This paradigm misses an entire dimension represented by cellular function and activity, information that is potentially of great significance in understanding cell/tissue state. Recently, a new field has emerged that uses coherence-gated imaging to quantify living tissue motion as a proxy of cellular function and activity. Coherence-based motility imaging is relatively new - much remains to be learned about the nature of its dynamic signal. In addition, many of the coherence-gated technologies described to date lack the resolution to investigate individual cells. The ones that are capable of seeing cells do not provide cross-sectional images and thus miss important architectural patterns associated with tissue maturation. We have developed a form of coherence-gated imaging called 1-µm optical coherence tomography (µOCT). µOCT has a resolution of 1 µm axial by 2 µm lateral, enabling cross-sectional visualization of tissue at the cellular level. Recently, we have discovered that by sequentially acquiring multiple µOCT images and computing the pixel-per-pixel power spectrum, we observe a dramatic increase in image contrast and new information emerging from the µOCT datasets. Preliminary studies with this new technology, termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT), suggest that it can be used to visualize epithelial maturation, cell death/apoptosis, and cellular activity. In this grant, we will mature this technology by conducting key validation studies in a variety of clinically relevant human tissues, animal models, and spheroids to understand the dynamic signal and determine its accuracy for diagnosing pathology, activity, and response to therapy (apoptosis/necrosis) (Aim 1). We also will advance DµOCT further by increasing spatial and temporal resolution, creating new data mining analysis pipelines, and developing and validating technology and probes that enable DµOCT to be implemented in vivo (Aim 2). By expanding our understanding and implementation of this exciting technology, we hope to provide a powerful new tool that will have significant and wide-reaching impact in the biological and clinical sciences. In this proposal we will develop a cross-sectional imaging technology termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT) that identifies distinct cells and tissues using intracellular motility signatures, a proxy of cell activity and state. Research will involve conducting a series of experiments in spheroids, animals, and human tissue to understand the nature of the dynamic signal and determine the diagnostic capacity of this technology for distinguishing disease, cell/tissue activity, and response to therapy. We additionally will develop next generation DµOCT technology that will increase resolution, provide more powerful diagnostic algorithms, and enable the use of DµOCT in living patients.",Dynamic µOCT for cellular tissue phenotyping,10221328,R01CA265742,"['3-Dimensional', 'ANXA5 gene', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Epithelial', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Frequencies', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Melanoma Cell', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Necrosis', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phase-Contrast Microscopy', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Propidium Diiodide', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'animal tissue', 'base', 'cell motility', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'contrast imaging', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental study', 'histological slides', 'human tissue', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdevice', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,619861
"Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging/Spectroscopy System For Robotic Cancer Surgery Guidance PROJECT SUMMARY In this competitive renewal for R01 CA187427, we will continue to advance label-free Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIm) to enhance the functionality of the widely-used da Vinci Surgical platform with an emphasis on Trans-Oral-Robotic-Surgery (TORS). UC Davis has pioneered the intra-operative use of FLIm and our partner, Intuitive Surgical, is the global leader in robotic-assisted surgery. To date, we have demonstrated a) the synergetic integration of a point-scanning FLIm device with the da Vinci Surgical System (first-of-its-kind); b) the potential of this approach to improve surgical decision-making during TORS without modifying conventional clinical protocols; and c) the utility of FLIM-derived parameters detecting biochemical and metabolic characteristics to distinguish oral and oropharyngeal cancer in real-time from surrounding normal tissue in patients in-situ.. We also developed innovative methods for real-time dynamic augmentation of imaging parameters on the surgical field of view. Capitalizing on the major accomplishments and knowledge gained under the current R01, the overarching objective of this renewal application is to 1) demonstrate FLIm’s diagnostic value in prospective studies by accounting for biological/experimental variables identified as critical under the current R01 and leveraging pre-operative imaging and clinical information and 2) enhance the visualization of FLIm-based classifiers on the surgeon console for real-time intraoperative feedback. To accomplish our overall objective, we propose three specific aims: Aim 1. Expand the FLIm database and develop tissue-type classifiers (retrospective analysis) accounting for biological variables (e.g., patient age/sex, tumor origin/location) and experimental situations (e.g., epithelial surface vs deep margins, tumors of an unknown primary) and the pre- operative imaging (CT, PET) features used in surgical planning. Aim 2. Develop, validate and perform regulatory activities for enhanced FLIm data visualization in support of prospective clinical studies. Aim 3. Validate FLIm as a means of real-time intraoperative TORS guidance in a prospective study analysis. In summary, this study will demonstrate the clinical feasibility and utility of FLIm for intraoperative real-time assessment of oral and oropharyngeal cancer surgical margins. The acquired FLIm parameter database will enable subsequent large clinical trials for automated tissue classification and diagnostic prediction. While the focus of this application is on TORS surgeries, the label-free FLIm-based tissue assessment, characterized by simple, fast and flexible data acquisition and display, can be broadly applied to other procedures as the da Vinci Surgical System is used in a wide range of tumor surgeries including urologic, colorectal, gynecologic, and thoracic cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optimal cancer and functional outcomes from surgical treatment of head and neck cancer requires the surgeon to have the ability to intraoperatively distinguish neoplastic disease from adjacent normal tissue. Our novel optical imaging FLIm technique, coupled to the da Vinci surgical system, captures and analyzes tissue autofluorescence to identify distinct tissue types and display this information onto the surgeon’s field of view during trans-oral- robotic surgery (TORS). This enables a more accurate and optimal cancer removal while preserving adjacent normal tissue and function. The successful validation of FLIm, with the sophisticated incorporation of head and neck cancer patient and radiology data to improve the tissue classifier, will allow for more cures with less long- term side effects and will be easily extended to other robotic and endoscopic procedures, thus advancing innovation well beyond TORS.",Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging/Spectroscopy System For Robotic Cancer Surgery Guidance,10211948,R01CA187427,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cauterize', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Epithelial', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Hemostatic function', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'In Situ', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Medical Records', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Risk Management', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urologic Cancer', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cancer surgery', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'functional outcomes', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'image registration', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'robotic system', 'sex', 'side effect', 'solid state', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'surgery outcome', 'symposium', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,633669
"Real time colon histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death in the US. Active screening and early intervention in risky cancers can lead to good outcomes; however, a bottleneck in rapidly delivering appropriate patient care is the long time period for histologic assessment and lack of precision in predicting disease severity. Morphological assessments prevalent in histology are useful but resource intensive and not predictive enough. Molecular techniques to complement traditional pathology are emerging but often require much more effort and time, without being especially compatible with histologic assessments. Here, we seek to develop a technology that measures the chemical content of tissues, does not require reagents, is entirely compatible with clinical workflows and leverages modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to provide real-time histologic assessment. The foundation of our approach is a new design for an infrared spectroscopic imaging system that is faster than any reported, offers a higher spatial and spectral quality and uses a solid immersion lens with a fixed focus at the sealed surface of the lens to enable use by a minimally trained person. In conjunction with the instrument, we develop AI algorithms that measure the chemical content of tissue and use it to provide (a) conventional pathology images without the use of dyes (“stainless staining”), and (b) histologic assessment based on molecular data, which can provide complementary composition, disease and risk of lethal cancer images akin to conventional pathology. The instrument will be usable by laboratory technicians, without the need to prepare thin sections from excised tissue and will provide information in minutes. Using preliminary data from human patients on over 850 tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 8 TMAs and 30 surgical resections, we validate the use of technology in providing complete histologic and disease grade assessment. Statistical methods will be used to assess the results rigorously and quantitative milestones guide the entire approach. We then translate the results to fresh tissue chunks, providing histology minutes after tissue is extracted from the body. Finally, we use the detailed tumor and microenvironment information available from the tissue to segment patients into a “high risk” and “low risk” group. The availability of rapid histologic assessment can help prevent delays in providing care, provide intraoperative assessment, and add more information to morphologic assessments following screening, enabling a wide use in CRC and other cancer pathologies. Project Narrative Colorectal cancers (CRC) are among the leading causes of death from cancers in the US. Morphologically assessing excised tissue is the gold standard but requires fixation, staining, microscopy and pathology review, taking days and the information not being especially prognostic. This project develops an alternate technology based on chemical imaging evaluation that can provide an assessment within minutes, resulting in a new instrument, artificial intelligence methods for histology and microenvironment-powered prediction of disease course.",Real time colon histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging,10318008,R01CA260830,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Cancerous', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colon', 'Color', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronics', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Fourier Transform', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Immersion', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Chemicals', 'Laboratory Technicians', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymph Node Involvement', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microtomy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Polyps', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Reagent', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cell type', 'clinical translation', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'coronavirus disease', 'deep learning', 'design', 'design and construction', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'human data', 'imaging system', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'real-time images', 'rural setting', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'seal', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'technology validation', 'tissue archive', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,466088
"A Spatially Resolved Molecular Atlas of Human Endothelium Project Abstract Recent advances in imaging and genomics are revolutionizing our understanding of human tissues. As these two technologies become more intertwined and high-throughput, there is an increasing need for scalable methods to interpret these data with single-cell resolution. In this Supplement, we seek to build on ongoing work to develop scalable and accurate algorithms for single-cell analysis of spatial genomics data. We propose to develop annotation software for annotating individual cells, their cell types, and functional tissue units in multiplexed imaging data.

"Developing computational algorithms for histopathological image analysis Project Summary  Histopathology is the cornerstone of disease diagnosis and prognosis. With the advance of imaging technology, whole-slide image (WSI) scanning of tissue slides is becoming a routine clinical procedure and producing a massive amount of data that captures histopathological details in high resolution. Most current pathological image analysis methods, similar to general image analysis approaches, mainly focus on morphology features, such as tissue texture and granularity, but ignore the complex hierarchical structures of tissues. Cells are the fundamental building blocks to tissues. Different types of cells are first organized into cellular components, which together with the extracellular matrix, form different types of tissue architectures. Understanding the interactions among these different types of cells can provide critical insights into biology and disease status. However, there are some major computational challenges: (1) How to identify and classify different types of cells in tissue, (2) how to characterize the highly complex and heterogeneous spatial organization of tissue, and (3) how to integrate histopathology data with other types of data to study disease status and progression. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel computational methods to analyze histopathology image data to study disease status and progression. In order to achieve this goal, we have built a strong research team with complementary expertise in image analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and clinical pathology. Specifically, we will develop novel algorithms to: (1) classify different types of cells from histopathology tissue WSI scans, (2) characterize and quantify cell spatial distribution and cell-cell interactions, and (3) integrate histopathology data with other types data to study disease progression. All proposed methods were motivated by real-world biological and clinical applications across different types of diseases, such as liver diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. If implemented successfully, the proposed study will facilitate the analysis and modeling of data generated from histopathology tissue slides to improve disease risk assessment, diagnosis, and outcome prediction. Narrative Technological advances in histopathology imaging and computing have enabled the in-depth characterization of pathology tissues.
