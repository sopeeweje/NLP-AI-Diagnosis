"AI based system for longitudinal, repeated measure analyses of freely moving C. elegans worms Abstract This project aims to develop WormInvestigator™, a novel, highly innovative system for performing automated, high-throughput and longitudinal studies of the behavior of C. elegans worms freely moving and socially interacting on agar plates (hereafter: ""freely moving worms"") across multiple time points over extended times (e.g., multiple days) with repeated measures designs. Work in Phase I will focus on demonstrating feasibility of our novel, patent pending, WormRecognizer™ technology – the ability to perform automatic, image-based identification of individual C. elegans worms within a group of freely moving worms (""digital tagging of freely moving worms""). Work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of WormInvestigator for the commercial release. The innovation inherent in WormRecognizer will serve as the basis for enabling a game- changing innovation in the field – the ability to perform high throughput longitudinal, repeated measures design analyses of locomotion and other behavior of freely moving C. elegans worms from discrete, non-continuous video sequences. Compared to study designs that have independent groups repeated measures designs offer more statistical power and the possibility to track an effect over time. Specifically, repeated measures designs for analyzing locomotion and other behavior of freely moving worms will allow researchers to definitively assess the likelihood that a particular behavior is associated with a prior behavior, which is impossible without repeated measures designs or impractical continuous imaging and tracking under constant illumination. WormRecognizer will leverage the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform automatic identification of the tracks of the same worm in videos of groups of freely moving worms recorded at different time points; encouraging pilot data were generated during preparation of this application. C. elegans is increasingly used as a model organism in research focusing on brain mechanisms underlying complex behaviors and pathological alterations thereof, including research into neurodevelopment, Alzheimer's disease, autism, schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. Thus, WormInvestigator will enable significant advancements in various mental neuroscience applications that use C. elegans as a model organism. Specifically, the fact that C. elegans express many of the neurotransmitters and associated receptors that are found in higher eukaryotes, including humans, makes C. elegans highly attractive for the (high throughput) screening of next generation therapeutics for mental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as for disorders that rely on neurotransmitter release modulation such as next generation treatments for schizophrenia. We will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of WormInvestigator in close collaboration with expert neuroscientists. Market research performed during preparation of this application indicated that WormInvestigator will expand the use of C. elegans as a model organism to many laboratories that do not currently use them. A competing technology is not available. We anticipate the global market size for WormInvestigator to be more than 300 systems. Narrative Performing longitudinal studies and repeated measures design analyses in both short-term and long-term experimental assays focusing on the analysis of locomotion and other behavior of multiple C. elegans worms holds the promise of profound progress in next-generation neuroscience studies such as understanding neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as aging research, drug discovery and toxicology. Our proposed product will be a transformative technology, using new analytical methods based on artificial intelligence algorithms that, for the first time, will enable researchers to perform these data-rich longitudinal studies and, thus, repeated measures design analyses in assays using C. elegans as a model organism. This system will allow researchers to make new discoveries based on new studies that are currently not feasible, ultimately providing the basis for developing novel treatments to prevent and fight complex brain diseases.","AI based system for longitudinal, repeated measure analyses of freely moving C. elegans worms",10258638,R43MH126834,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Agar', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Eukaryota', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lighting', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Market Research', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population Analysis', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Serotonin', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'fighting', 'free behavior', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'longitudinal analysis', 'neural network architecture', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmitter release', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'social', 'usability']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R43,2021,449987
"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10223435,R01HL153543,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Education', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'brief intervention', 'clinically significant', 'dietary', 'dietary adherence', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'patient engagement', 'pilot trial', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'skills training', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2021,607792
"Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY People vary in both the quantity and the quality of their sleep. Traditional sleep “stages” (for example, slow- wave sleep or REM sleep) can exhibit different neural correlates (as measured by electroencephalography, EEG) in different people and at different times during the night. Standard approaches for characterizing sleep (“staging”) do not take this variability into account, however. Here we suggest that attempts to use EEG and other data to infer sleep stages should in fact tackle the heterogeneity between and within individuals explicitly, to yield more accurate classification not just of an individual’s minute-by-minute sleep, but of the sleeper’s typical characteristics more generally. Quantitative, data-driven individual sleep profiles will be important prerequisites for emerging large-scale molecular genetics and other ‘omics studies of sleep, and for driving personalized sleep medicine more generally. Specifically, we propose to leverage more than ten thousand whole-night polysomnography (PSG) studies from the demographically diverse National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), in order to optimally apply machine-learning methods to sleep signals. Most importantly, the NSRR dataset will enable approaches that take the fundamental heterogeneity of sleep into account: this is a rate-limiting step that has not been tackled by previous approaches. We hypothesize that it is not the large training set per se, but rather the increased prospects for better-matched training data, combined with the methods developed here, that will be beneficial. To this end, we will build and disseminate a novel, multi-level automated sleep classifier based on the world’s largest dataset of sleep signals. PROJECT NARRATIVE People vary considerably not just in how much they sleep, but also in the types of sleep they typically have. Standard approaches to describing sleep, primarily developed in the 1960s, only partially capture this variability: we propose to use a range of measures, including brain activity, on over ten thousand sleeping individuals to generate more accurate, data-driven, personalized profiles of how a person's sleep varies over a night. Sleep factors are associated with multiple physical and neuropsychiatric illnesses, and so better measurement of the underlying processes will be critical for future genetic and biomarker studies aimed at understanding the links between sleep, health and disease.",Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling,10084929,R01HL146339,"['Adult', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Label', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mythology', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Polysomnography', 'Process', 'Property', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stage I Sleep', 'Stage II Sleep', 'Staging', 'Stretching', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'heuristics', 'implicit bias', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular scale', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'sleep health', 'sleep onset', 'tool', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,444813
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships. The Program Project applies integrative, multi-level and multi-method approaches in community samples of midlife men and women to understand brain phenotypes for CVD risk.

"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. This knowledge can be utilized to reduce the public health burden of tobacco use.",Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment,10074543,R01CA224537,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anger', 'Behavioral', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'knowledge base', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'primary outcome', 'risk prediction model', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,1
"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood. PROJECT NARRATIVE A key challenge for psychiatry and clinical psychology is to discover, understand, and ultimately treat the root causes of the most common mental illness, including anxiety and depressive disorders. This project will harness an innovative combination of longitudinal measures and state-of-the-art tools—including a multi-generational pedigree, brain imaging, and deep neural networks—to objectively identify and prioritize the pathways that contribute to maladaptive social behavior as individuals mature into adults.

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior.

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive.

"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10218158,R01DK125414,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Promotion Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cancer risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'control theory', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'mHealth', 'personalized medicine', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'relapse risk', 'theories', 'treatment duration', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,510240
"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day. The findings of the study about healthy eating patterns will also improve dietary recommendations by adding messages on when and how often to eat during a day.",TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS,10053329,R01CA226937,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anthropometry', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight', 'Body mass index', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calories', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Evaluation', 'Fasting', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'dietary', 'dietary guidelines', 'doubly-labeled water', 'epidemiology study', 'food consumption', 'good diet', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'prudent diet', 'tool', 'vector', 'waist circumference', 'western diet']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,224806
"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.

"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,10110031,R01NR013658,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Beds', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emotional Stress', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Financial Activity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'clinical trial implementation', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'fitbit', 'functional outcomes', 'group intervention', 'health assessment', 'health management', 'health related quality of life', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tv watching']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,592501
"Robust Characterization of Brain-Heart Coupling Across Development and Modulations by Disordered Sleep ABSTRACT Balanced communication between the brain and heart is critical to both cardiovascular and cognitive health. Although the anatomical pathways facilitating this communication have been well characterized, the electrodynamic coupling between the two systems remains elusive, particularly during development. A distributed network of brain structures that regulates cardiac function undergoes profound changes and reorganization during the first two decades of life. The impact of these anatomical changes and postnatal heart maturation on cerebro-cardiovascular coupling is poorly understood. Yet, this is a fundamental mechanism that, if impaired, may lead to significant deficits in both systems. At the macroscale of the intact human brain and heart, simultaneously acquired electrophysiological data may provide transformative new insights into both electrodynamic system coupling and its modulation by disorders and stressors. To date, the adverse effects of such stressors, particularly unhealthy sleep associated with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a disorder that affects up to 10% of children in the US, on this electrodynamic coupling during wakefulness and sleep remain poorly understood. This project aims to significantly improve the field’s knowledge through two potentially transformative contributions. Aim 1 will develop a blueprint of normal electrodynamic interaction between the developing brain and heart, during wakefulness and sleep, by leveraging the large volume of existing data from clinical physiological studies (which include both EEG and ECG) from patients with no evidence of underlying disease. A total of n ~= 1400 patients, with simultaneous EEG and ECG, spanning in age infancy to young adulthood will be analyzed using cutting-edge signal and machine learning tools and models, to establish a typical developmental trajectory of the electrodynamic interaction between the brain and heart. Aim 2 will use this blueprint to systematically investigate the adverse impact of disordered sleep on cerebro-cardiovascular coupling in 453 children with OSA (ages 5-10 years) and ~400 children with snoring (who did not meet criteria for OSA), using publicly available polysomnography data from the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT). Dynamic EEG-ECG interactions at baseline and follow up will be compared to normal system coupling in the same age range, estimated in Aim 1. Deviations from normative coupling will be investigated as a function of cognitive outcomes. Clinical physiology/polysomnography studies contain a wealth of valuable information but remain severely underutilized. This project will leverage these Big Data to robustly characterize a fundamental yet currently elusive mechanism that may affect both cognitive and cardiovascular health across the lifespan. In addition, the establishment of a normative developmental trajectory of cerebro-cardiovascular coupling may become a significant research resource for future studies. Findings may provide transformative insights into the communication between the two organs, necessary to maintain their respective long-term health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using novel signal processing and machine learning tools and Big Physiological Data from existing clinical studies and the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT), this project aims to first develop a blueprint of electrodynamic cardiovascular-neural coupling during wakefulness and sleep and robustly characterize its developmental trajectory. This blueprint of the two systems’ electrodynamic interaction will then be used to elucidate the adverse impact of disordered sleep (as a result of Obstructive Sleep Apnea), in children age 5-10 years. Findings from this project may have a transformative impact on the field’s understanding of the dynamic communication between the brain and heart and its modulation by unhealthy/insufficient sleep, a significant problem in children with potentially profound implications for cognitive and cardiovascular health across the lifespan.",Robust Characterization of Brain-Heart Coupling Across Development and Modulations by Disordered Sleep,10293076,R21HL156186,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Polysomnography', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosencephalon', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Snoring', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Time', 'Ventricular', 'Wakefulness', 'arm', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical database', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'critical period', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'heart function', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'sleep quality', 'stressor', 'tool', 'young adult']",NHLBI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,132750
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10266835,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2021,273213
"The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored. In short, while poor sleep could be an important contributor to health disparities and accelerated aging, we know relatively little about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This K01 application will provide key training for career advancement and begin to close this gap in knowledge. To accomplish this goal, a randomized field experiment with 400 participants, each enrolled for over one month, in Chennai, India, will (1) objectively measure sleep and key environmental factors to provide preliminary evidence on the role of environmental causes of sleep deprivation in an urban environment, (2) rigorously evaluate two simple scalable interventions to reduce sleep deprivation among low-income adults in their natural environments, (3) estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision- making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, alcohol consumption), and earnings, and (4) utilizing questions regarding sleep asked of both RCT participants and a 50,000 person nationally-representative sample, estimate the extent of sleep deprivation and its impacts more broadly in urban India. The training aims underpinning the research aims and the applicant's long-term research goals are to expand knowledge and skills in: (1) cognitive psychology and the measurement of cognitive function, (2) aging, and (3) machine learning and predictive modeling. This training, accomplished through multiple avenues including coursework, directed study, and mentorship, will directly facilitate the proposed research and extend the scope and impact of the applicant's long-term research career studying health disparities and interactions between health and decision-making which may impact both cognitive and physical health as individuals age. Notably, while this application focuses on the impacts of sleep deprivation, the potential for health to shape decision-making is much broader. Constant exposure to other aspects of poor health associated with poverty, such as pain, also have the potential to exert a mental tax, leading to impaired cognition and poor decisions. Such a negative feedback loop between these factors and decision-making has the potential to further exacerbate health disparities. The far-reaching applicability of this idea beyond the direct scope of this proposal opens the door to high public-health significance through a wide variety of channels. Project narrative Although sleep has significant potential to impair cognition and impede health, relatively little is known about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This research will begin to close this gap in knowledge through a 400 person randomized trial in Chennai, India, which will objectively and rigorously measure sleep and key environmental factors impacting sleep, evaluate the impact of two simple and scalable interventions to improve sleep, and estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision-making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, tobacco consumption), and earnings. Providing rigorous evidence on these relationships and improving our collective understanding of the causes and costs to sleep deprivation, including not just direct health outcomes, but also shifts in preferences and decision-making directly relevant to health, will provide policy-relevant information important to improving health and healthy behaviors as well as promoting heathy and economically-secure aging.",The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India,10079453,K01AG055691,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Career Mobility', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Cost Measures', 'Decision Making', 'Developing Countries', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impaired health', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adverse outcome', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure reduction', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'diarrheal disease', 'disadvantaged population', 'discount', 'econometrics', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sleep health', 'urban setting']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2021,127872
"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans. In particular, social-environmental factors at the US-Mexico border may play an important role in sleep health disparities. This project will not only allow for increased understanding of the complex relationship among sleep, health, and social-environmental pressures, but through a community partnership it can maximize our ability to reduce these disparities. Also, this project has the added benefit of providing information about the role of sleep as a potentially modifiable factor in cardiovascular disease and diabetes disparities as well.",Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study,10102645,R01MD011600,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Metabolic', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'caucasian American', 'community partnership', 'diaries', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'food security', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'low density lipoprotein triglyceride', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'perceived stress', 'pressure', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'sample collection', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep difficulty', 'sleep health', 'social', 'social factors', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,855472
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,10164863,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'patient engagement', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2021,694636
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,10126727,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2021,475626
"Determinants of insufficient sleep among blacks and effects on disparities in health outcomes Project Summary Insufficient sleep (IS), stemming from sleep apnea, shift work, insomnia, working over 40 hr./week, unfavorable sleep environments and/or volitional reduction of bedtime, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers (elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and arterial stiffness), inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein) as well as with brain injury. Compelling evidence shows racial/ethnic disparities in insufficient sleep (IS), with blacks exhibiting a three-fold greater risk of IS relative to whites. Disparities might arise from physiologic and genetic factors, but recent evidence suggests environmental and psychosocial factors are also critical determinants. This study will utilize innovative dynamic modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants (associative factors) of actigraphic IS and its putative associations with adverse health outcomes among blacks. Individual- and contextual-level data will be captured using novel home-based recordings and GIS data to model the environmental context where sleep occurs. The proposed study will leverage success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup led by Dr. Jean- Louis (PI), who has been conducting community-engaged sleep research for over 10 years. The workgroup comprises outstanding investigators with expertise in sleep and circadian rhythm, CVD, brain health, health disparities, translational behavioral medicine, and multi-level dynamic modeling. The study will benefit from experience of our standing Community Steering Committee, enabling recruitment of 560 blacks in various venues to participate in weeklong home studies to achieve proposed study aims. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify psychosocial (social support, discrimination, and attitudes/beliefs) and environmental (household [density, noise, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, and neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with IS; ascertain effects of IS on (a) markers of CVD (obesity, BP, lipid profile, and glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and on (b) markers of brain injury (tau, amyloid-β, neurofilament light, homocysteine, and glial fibrillary acidic protein; and develop profiles of blacks with IS-related adverse health outcomes using individual- and environmental-level data applying innovative multi-level dynamic modeling tools (Bayesia Belief Network and Agent-Based Simulation). This study will provide evidence to delineate factors underlying greater rates of IS among blacks and explain putative associations with markers of CVD, inflammation, and brain injury. These data will provide the foundation for longitudinal studies assessing causal effects of IS on these novel markers and interventions to mitigate adverse effects of IS on health outcomes. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that blacks exhibit a three-fold greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and brain injury. It will provide multi-level evidence on the impact of the psychosocial and environmental factors on insufficient sleep among blacks.

"CRCNS: Unsupervised Learning of Hippocampal Sequence Dynamic in Sleep   In unit recordings from large populations of neurons, fast compressed sequential firing of neurons during rest and early sleep have been found to replay patterns first observed in active awake experience. These remarkable patterns have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community and beyond. Sequence  replay is now considered to play a critical role in the long-term stabilization and storage of mnemonically  important information. However, despite the general acknowledgement of the importance of the sequential structure, very little is known about the null background against which replay is compared. Specifically, are apparently 'non-replaying' spike patterns, as seen in late sleep, just simply noise? Because replay is typically assessed by comparison against a fixed known template, most methods can only determine whether the resemblance to the template is more than what might be expected from  random spike trains. But these methods cannot appraise whether other patterns remain in the nonsignificant events. Recently, the Diba and Kemere labs successfully collaborated to address precisely  this issue. We developed methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) to uncover temporal structure in spike trains of neurons in an unsupervised template-free manner. In this proposal, we aim to further improve these methods and to evaluate the hidden structure of spike trains in hippocampal  neuronal populations during sleep. In our second specific aim, we will use HMMs to determine both co-active ensemble (""contextual"") and temporal patterns (""sequential"") structure in hippocampal spike trains in both pre- and post-task sleep. In the third specific aim, we will probe the essence of sleep replay further, by exposing animals to multiple novel and familiar maze environments prior to long durations of sleep. In the fourth specific aim, we will perform closed-loop disruption of neuronal population patterns to  examine the causal interplay and reverberation of these patterns from early to late sleep. In summary, our  proposal is designed to provide strongest characterization to date of the structure of ""noise"" in replay events. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This study will provide an opening to evaluate the role of sleep in reorganizing information in the brain and  help to identify critical time windows and neuronal activities during sleep which are particularly important  for information storage and stabilization. Our assumptions and deductions about the nature and purpose  of sleep implicitly inform all manner of public policy, from the durations of shifts for hospital and relief  workers, to morning start times of public schools.

"The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay Project Summary The hippocampus is a critical site for rapid memory formation and retrieval, with extensively documented functions representing spatial and navigational variables, yet less is known of the means by which it guides behavior. Bursts of hippocampal activity identified in many species as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are promising neural mechanisms to link hippocampal activity and behavioral function, since during SWRs hippocampus can represent positions the animal previously experienced, or will traverse in the near future. This proposal considers the food-caching behaviors of chickadees, who use a hippocampal-dependent, one- shot memory to guide cache retrieval. This behavior is exceptionally promising to link hippocampal activity to individual experiences, which has been a barrier to determining the nature of representations during SWR and their function in previous studies. These studies will develop a comprehensive account of how chickadee behavior is affected by cache site memory, determine whether SWRs are related to memory-specific components of caching behavior, and determine whether SWRs represent individual cache sites to assist later retrieval. I hypothesize that memory-guided behavior is distinguishable from random foraging. I will use video tracking to measure the behavioral microstructure of chickadee caching behavior, including postural and gaze time series, and develop quantitative models of behavioral motifs and their temporal structure. Using these tools to compare memory-guided and random foraging behaviors, I will develop decoders that indicate precisely how and when behavior appears memory-guided. I hypothesize that SWRs occur more often, and are more predictive of behavior, when behavior is memory- guided. I will use electrophysiology in freely moving chickadees during caching to relate SWRs to the microstructural analysis of behavior and decoding of behavioral strategy. I hypothesize that SWRs reactivate representations of previous, individual caching events, and that this reactivation improves subsequent retrieval for that individual site. Using electrophysiological recordings in caching birds, I will relate reactivations to the accuracy of retrieval behavior. Using online SWR detection and suppression, I will further determine if SWRs causally affect later retrieval behavior. Project Narrative Food caching birds are a unique model system for dissecting the fundamental principles of hippocampal function. Thorough characterization and computational modeling of this behavior, and the specific contribution of hippocampal memory, will allow insight into the neural mechanisms by which hippocampal representations guide behavior. We expect the principles resulting from this study to illuminate dysfunctions of memory present in many neurological disorders.",The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay,10162319,F32MH123015,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Future', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Series', 'Site', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'way finding']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,71390
"Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American ABSTRACT  Obesity is a major public health problem that is related to a variety of illnesses, such as heart disease and diabetes. Prior research indicates that social stressors contribute to risk for obesity, possibly through alterations in diet and physical activity. However, it is not fully clear how these alterations contribute to obesity. In this study, we examine how the stressors of social isolation and discrimination are related to eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and further, how these behaviors affect the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis. Our prior research has suggested that BGM alterations play an important role in the development of obesity. Our study focuses on Mexican and Filipina women because research shows that they encounter a high burden of obesity as well as exposure to social stressors.  We will screen and enroll approximately 300 Mexican and Filipina women who will then provide information about social stressors via a survey, dietician-administered 24-hour food recall, measured anthropometrics (e.g. waist circumference), questionnaire data regarding diet and eating behaviors, and accelerometer data on physical activity. Stool and serum to determine microbial-related measures (16sRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics), and MRI to assess brain alterations in the extended reward network will be collected. Advanced multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate data from multiple data sources (neuroimaging, microbiome and metabolite profiles, survey data, diet, and clinical/behavioral data). This analysis will determine the unique variance associated with ethnicity and social stressors in moderating eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and the BGM axis related to obesity. An integrated systems investigative approach such as the one proposed is a critical step to understanding the mechanisms contributing to obesity. Further the impact of how environmental stressors “get under the skin” and impact eating behaviors and diet patterns and the BGM axis is important in addressing health disparities in ethnic groups and in women. This premise guides the specific aims of this proposal: Aim A: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on brain signatures and eating patterns in obesity. Aim B: We will phenotype the influence of stressors on gut microbiome and metabolites in obesity. Aim C: We will apply advanced analytical techniques in order to determine ethnic differences in the influence of stressors on the BGM axis in obesity.  The results of this study will provide novel information about a possible pathway whereby social stressors affect behavioral, neurological and microbiome mechanisms related to obesity risk. It will also provide new information in BGM patterns in two understudied ethnic groups. In the long term, this research may suggest possible approaches for intervention that may help reduce inequalities in obesity and related health problems. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study will provide new information about how social stressors contribute to obesity among Mexican and Filipino American women. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that stressors lead to eating behaviors and dietary changes and that alter the brain-gut-microbiome axis. A better understanding of the role of how stress “gets under the skin” to contribute to alterations in the brain and gut microbial metabolites in obesity, could lead to novel therapeutic strategies tailored to treat altered ingestive behaviors and obesity.",Social Isolation and Discrimination as Stressors Influencing Brain-Gut Microbiome Alterations among Filipino and Mexican American,10129475,R01MD015904,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Aromatic Amino Acids', 'Asians', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calories', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Fibrinogen', 'Filipino American', 'Firmicutes Bacteroidetes ratio', 'Food', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Neurologic', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Social Discrimination', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tryptophan', 'Woman', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'craving', 'dietary', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic minority population', 'food consumption', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'immune activation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'multiple data sources', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'recruit', 'response', 'sex', 'social culture', 'social stressor', 'stool sample', 'stressor', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning', 'waist circumference']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,779086
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10187539,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detection platform', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2021,399000

"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY – Parent U01  Emerging adulthood (ages 18-29 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance; therefore, to ad- dress this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, re- active processes are difficult to measure because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect inten- sive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. Data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within- days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learn- ing to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and meth- ods will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Health Behavior Network’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE - Parent U01 Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults.

"Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control 7. Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading major cause of preventable death in the United States, and cigarette smoking is a contributor to lung cancer in 80%–90% of cases. Though adult cigarette smoking rates have declined substantially during the past 50 years, they remain as high as 30% in certain groups, such as individuals living in poverty. Quitting is difficult: a given quit attempt results in cessation in fewer than 10% of cases, and most adult cigarette smokers have attempted and failed to quit, and often many times. What is urgently needed are novel interventions for cigarette smoking cessation that operate through different mechanisms from those targeted by existing interventions, which are likely to have been unsuccessful for persistent smokers. A barrier to progress is that the mechanisms of action of most treatments are not known, which makes it difficult to know which treatment will work best for whom. We turn to affective science to identify a candidate technique that could serve as the basis for a novel intervention. Research on affect regulation typically focuses on down- regulation of affective states, such as craving for cigarettes, using effortful strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. However, a new insight in affect regulation is that people can construe, or subjectively understand, events with varying levels of abstraction, and that construing health-related behaviors in high- versus low-level terms promotes health behavior in several domains. For example, smokers who want to quit are more likely to resist a cigarette when they construe the same event (e.g., “abstinence”) in more abstract, high-level terms (e.g., “becoming a better me”) versus more concrete, low-level terms (e.g., “not smoking this cigarette”). There is some evidence that high-level construal might rely on distinct mechanisms from traditional affect regulation and smoking reduction interventions, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Directly comparing its mechanisms to those of alternative affect regulation strategies and developing tools to induce high-level construal are the next steps on the path toward developing a novel intervention. Also, establishing individual differences in the effects of high-level construal will allow future interventions to be targeted to the individuals for whom they will be maximally effective. We identified two candidate mechanisms through which high-level construal might operate: down-regulation of craving and up-regulation of goal energization (i.e., motivation to quit). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed the neural systems engaged by those processes to be distinct. So, we will use multivariate analyses of fMRI data to quantify the similarity of high-level construal to each candidate (Aim 1). This will be done in a longitudinal translational experiment with 4 conditions—high- level construal, down-regulation of craving, up-regulation of goal energization, and treatment-as-usual—in a sample of persistent smokers in poverty, who are the most likely to benefit from a novel, theory-based treatment. The sample size (N = 240) affords an examination of individual differences in the effect of high-level construal on neural activity and craving, and the degree to which they predict smoking reduction (Aim 2). 8. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking is among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States because smoking increases risk for lung cancer and various diseases. Though U.S. smoking rates have declined, a substantial percentage of adults, particularly those living in poverty who have repeatedly tried and failed to quit, still smoke and therefore could benefit from novel interventions for cessation that operate through different mechanisms than those of traditional treatments. This study will use neuroimaging to uncover the mechanisms of action of a promising strategy for affect regulation and smoking cessation and also build profiles of individuals for whom this strategy does and does not work, thereby providing tangible and practical information that public health professionals and clinicians can use to inform personalized treatments for cigarette smoking cessation.",Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control,10127602,R01CA240452,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medial', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cigarette craving', 'cigarette smoking', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cost', 'craving', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'insight', 'lens', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'preventable death', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,595543
"WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild Project Summary Behavioral interventions for weight loss include self-monitoring and self-report of diet. However, few people adhere to self-monitoring because they believe it will be a burden. For those who do adhere, biased reporting leads to poor accuracy. Self-report measures have helped us understand contextual factors of problematic eating behaviors, but we cannot validate such relationships to dietary intake and weight because of unreliable reporting. Therefore, we need an objective way to validate self-report measures. Automated self-monitoring, however, can lead to high eating false alarm detection rates (calling something eating when it is not eating). It also requires participants to push buttons during the start and end of a meal. Passive and unobtrusive ways to capture images of food intake would improve accuracy of detection, avoid the need for a person to remember what they ate, and limit bias based on what participants believe to be socially desirable. Such methods could also ease the self-monitoring burden, decrease errors associated with self- report measures, and lay the foundation for understanding when and how problematic eating behaviors occur. Image capture using wearable cameras may help us better understand obesity and its context (that is, the situation in which eating occurs). However, privacy and ethical concerns of bystanders whose images are taken are a significant barrier. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that participants are both willing to wear and that provides meaningful information on food intake and context associated with problematic eating behaviors. Several methods exist, known as obfuscation, that can filter unnecessary information in the scene. However, we do not know which method is most acceptable to a person wearing the device in everyday life that would encourage greatest wear-time. Our project aims to determine which method is best for preserving privacy while providing enough information to understand eating behaviors and their context. To do this, we will observe participants in their everyday life, with special attention to eating behaviors. We will use these new image capture techniques to help understand eating behaviors associated with obesity. First, we will select the best obfuscation method by testing the most well-known obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial to identify which method has the greatest participant acceptability and feasibility (compared with no obfuscation). We will test a novel wearable camera with an infrared sensor (allows us to determine objects that are near vs. far in the camera) with 3 obfuscation methods in real-world settings, including a cartooning gaming–based method. We will then select the obfuscation method that increases wear time and design an eating algorithm around it. Using this algorithm we will assess our ability to capture behaviorally meaningful context from the obfuscated image, such as whether people are eating alone or not, at home, using screen time, and eating prepared or cooked food. This will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions in behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Obesity treatment would benefit greatly from an accurate understanding of problematic eating behaviors in real-world settings. Wearable video cameras provide significant utility in understanding eating behaviors, yet pose a major privacy concern in the real-world, significantly impacting longitudinal wear time. We are testing a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals with obesity will wear and that can accurately detect eating, which will advance our understanding of behavioral phenotypes surrounding obesity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild,10109884,R03DK127128,"['Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Cartoons', 'Chest', 'Clinical Research', 'Conscious', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Food Patterns', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population Research', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Reading', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Social Desirability', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'contextual factors', 'cooking', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'experience', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized intervention', 'preservation', 'privacy preservation', 'sensor', 'tv watching', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'weight loss intervention', 'willingness']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,116737
"Passive Assessment of Behavioral Warning Signs for Suicide Risk in Adolescents: An Idiographic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The rise in suicide rates is due in part to a failure to identify short-term risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Additionally, most existing research relies primarily on group-level methodological approaches to suicide risk assessment; intraindividual suicide risk processes are largely neglected. Because of the lack of knowledge on short-term and individual-level suicide risk, it remains unclear when and how to intervene with the individual adolescents who need it most. Three particularly promising observable, state-sensitive, temporally delimited, and modifiable proximal indicators of suicide risk among adolescents are social engagement, sleep, and physical activity. Although acute changes in these behavioral processes are often denoted as imminent “behavioral warning signs” of suicide, most existing research has examined these behavioral factors only as distal predictors and correlates of suicide risk. Importantly, their contribution to short- term risk using individual-level approaches (i.e., fully idiographic, “n-of-1” methods) remains unknown. The Candidate’s proposed K23’s overarching goal is to employ mobile sensing and actigraphy to assess whether objectively and passively measured acute behavioral changes from typical patterns of social engagement, sleep, and physical activity indicate proximal risk for increases in suicidal ideation using idiographic n-of-1 models in high-risk adolescents. It further aims to characterize the intraindividual network structure of these behavioral factors and suicidal ideation to enhance suicide risk assessment and guide intervention. Adolescents (N=100) admitted to an inpatient or partial hospital program due to acute suicide risk will be recruited. For a period of 3 months, wearable actigraphs will be used to assess adolescents’ sleep and physical activity and mobile sensing will be used to assess adolescents’ digital social engagement and patterns of movement to approximate additional indices of physical activity. Once-daily mobile surveys will be used to assess suicidal ideation. The proposed training plan complements the Candidate’s research plan and will facilitate training in: conducting translational digital health research in high-risk adolescents, passive mobile sensing, passive adolescent sleep and physical activity assessment via actigraphy, and advanced computational approaches to person-specific intensive data modeling. A team of leading scholars will provide expert mentorship to facilitate the Candidate’s training goals within the highly resourced environment of the Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. The proposed study will promote the Candidate’s long-term career goal to employ low-burden and scalable methods of assessment to develop personalized risk models that will improve the proximal prediction of suicide risk and inform intervention for youth. Through the execution of this research and training plan, the Candidate will be positioned to become a leader in the field of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The goal of the present study is to develop personalized risk models of adolescent suicidal ideation based on passive and objective data sources (using wearables and smartphone sensors indexing social engagement, sleep, and physical activity). Our innovative research design has the potential to identify when and how to intervene to reduce suicide risk in individual adolescents.",Passive Assessment of Behavioral Warning Signs for Suicide Risk in Adolescents: An Idiographic Approach,10190131,K23MH126168,"['Acute', 'Adolescent', 'American', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complement', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Reinforcing Factor', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'adolescent suicide', 'base', 'career', 'data modeling', 'density', 'digital', 'digital health', 'follow-up', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'neglect', 'network models', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'reducing suicide', 'sensor', 'social engagement', 'social media', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K23,2021,195456
"The Role of Sleep Health in Proximal Suicide Risk among Ultra-High Risk Adolescents ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people age 14–24, and rates in this age group are increasing. Most suicide risk factors are distal (i.e., long-standing, static), thus informative regarding who is at risk, but not when. As such, our ability to reliably predict near-term suicide risk among vulnerable populations remains grossly inadequate. Studies consistently demonstrate a link between subjective sleep disturbances and the continuum of suicidality. Yet, sleep is a complex behavior that can be measured along multiple dimensions and at varying levels of analysis. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the role of normative biological and psychosocial developmental processes that further contribute to dynamic changes in risk related to sleep disturbance. Such changes in sleep are particularly dramatic during adolescence. Studies also have not examined how sleep interacts with other known pathways, such as dysregulation in affective, cognitive and arousal-related systems, to lead to suicidality in vulnerable youth. We thus propose to conduct an 8-week prospective multi-method study of sleep health and suicidal thoughts and behavior in a transdiagnostic sample of ultra-high risk adolescents (14-18) who have recently enrolled in an Intensive Outpatient or Partial Hospitalization Program. We will capitalize on the extant clinical and research infrastructures to compare sleep-suicide associations and plausible affective, cognitive and arousal-related mechanisms using self-report, behavioral, lab task paradigms and physiology in adolescents at ultra-high risk for suicide. Project Narrative Despite the enormous public health problem of suicide among adolescents, little progress has been made toward improving assessment and prevention for this vulnerable group. We will conduct a prospective, longitudinal study to examine the near-term temporal associations between within-person fluctuations in sleep disturbance, dysregulation in affective, cognitive and arousal-related systems, and changes in suicidality over time in ultra-high risk adolescents. Critically, since sleep is a modifiable risk factor, our findings hold great promise to inform the development or modification of existing sleep/mental health interventions to lower suicide risk.",The Role of Sleep Health in Proximal Suicide Risk among Ultra-High Risk Adolescents,10107391,R01MH124907,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Day Care', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Dimensions', 'Distal', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Moods', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age effect', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'biopsychosocial', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cognitive control', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'mood symptom', 'outpatient programs', 'poor sleep', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep health', 'sleep quality', 'sleep regulation', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,766370
"Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients Multiple studies have shown that some patients who remain behaviorally unresponsive after severe brain damage can modulate their brain activity in response to command. A lack of response to the command- following paradigm in other patients, however, cannot be taken as evidence that consciousness is absent. There is thus an urgent need for neuroimaging tools that are able to diagnose covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive subjects without relying on a task. Previous neuroimaging studies of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) have mostly utilized between-state paradigms (e.g., wakefulness vs. sleep) or report-based contrasts, which conflate differences in brain activity supporting consciousness with differences in brain activity supporting behavior or task response. To address these limitations, my sponsor (Dr. Giulio Tononi) has developed a within-state, no-report paradigm that uses serial awakenings to contrast states of consciousness versus unconsciousness during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. Using high density electroencephalography (EEG), his group has shown that the occurrence of dreaming consciousness during sleep is associated with a reduction of delta activity (sleep slow waves) in a posterior cortical ‘hot zone’ encompassing occipital, parietal and temporal cortices. To proceed towards clinical applications, it is now essential to confirm and extend these findings using combined EEG-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). To this effect, in an important new development, Dr. Tononi and collaborators have recently shown that it is possible to faithfully track EEG slow wave activity during sleep by means of a high-frequency (~0.17 Hz) blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) oscillation evident in fMRI. This finding provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the NCCs during sleep with high spatial resolution, avoiding potential pitfalls of EEG source modeling, and with unrestricted access to subcortical structures. Taking advantage of these new findings, in this project, I propose to combine the novel fMRI signature of sleep slow waves with a serial awakenings paradigm to locate the NCCs during sleep. Specifically, I will acquire fMRI-EEG data during ~1,080 awakenings from sleep across 40 healthy subjects and investigate the neural correlates of the presence versus absence of dreaming consciousness (Aim 1). I hypothesize that high-frequency BOLD oscillation—which tracks sleep slow-waves—will show regional decreases in specific posterior cortical areas during dreaming compared to dreamless sleep. In Aim 2, I will use univariate and multivariate modeling approaches based on high-frequency BOLD power and conventional BOLD amplitude to identify the NCCs of specific dream contents (e.g., presence of faces) and complexity. If successful, the proposed experiments will constitute an important step forward in identifying brain regions that sustain consciousness and its contents during behaviorally unresponsive states. These results can open new avenues to improve clinical care in patients with a DOC and inform the assessment of intraoperative awareness in anesthetized subjects. Due to previous methodological oversights that confounded consciousness and behavior, the neural substrates of covert consciousness in unresponsive states are poorly understood. The current project will use serial awakenings with dream reports combined with a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signature of sleep slow waves to identify the neural correlates of both the presence of consciousness and its contents during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. The goal is to help clarify a scientific controversy surrounding the neural basis of consciousness at an unprecedented spatial resolution and with an access to subcortical structures, which could ultimately to improve diagnosis through neuroimaging and clinical care for patients with disorders of consciousness.",Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients,10420051,F32NS114034,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Board Certification', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consciousness Disorders', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dreams', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Occipital lobe', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vegetative States', 'Wakefulness', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain research', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'life-sustaining therapy', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'stimulus processing', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2021,32997
"The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD Project Summary To reduce the increasing societal and financial burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), prevention is critical. Even small improvements of the modifiable dementia risk factors on the individual level have the potential to lead to a substantial reduction of dementia cases at the population level. The disease processes occur for years though symptoms typically appear after age 60. Thus, identifying those at risk early for intervention is crucial. Studies among adults aged 60 years and older have identified performance-based measures of impairment in physical function as early indicators of ADRD, three or more years prior to onset. To improve earlier prediction of ADRD, we need research on adults aged 51-59 years to assess the relationship between physical functional impairment and likelihood of ADRD onset years later. Further, given the burden of administering performance-based measures of physical function, it would be advantageous to use patient- reported metrics of limitation in physical function for ADRD prediction. We propose using the 1998-2018 nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of adults aged 51-59 years to determine the extent to which patient-reported measures of function would facilitate efficient ADRD risk identification. Primary study aims are to: 1) To identify the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function in midlife predict future late-onset ADRD. We will use standardized (RAND HRS) self-reported measures of function and the Langa-Weir ADRD algorithm available in the HRS. Working hypothesis: Limitations in physical function, defined using summary measures of self-reported physical function predict onset of ADRD 4 to 20 years later. 2) Verify that sub-groups of adults, defined by limitations in physical function, aged 51-59 are at higher risk of developing ADRD. We will verify existence of sub-groups (identified in our preliminary analyses) using a computational systems approach (cluster analysis) are predictive of onset of ADRD through 2018, in adjusted analyses. Working hypothesis: Sub-groups of middle-aged adults with unique patterns of limitations in physical function are at higher risk of developing ADRD than those without physical functional deficit 4 to 20 years later, independent of related factors. This proposal addresses the objectives of PAS-19-391 in several ways. First, the Principal investigator (PI), an early stage investigator, is committed to a career in ADRD research. Second, the investigative team has training in non-neurological medical fields and will shift their research focus to ADRD prevention within their fields. Third, the PI has experience with an existing dataset (HRS); and will use it to assess age-related changes in non-cognitive processes that may be early signs of ADRD. Finally, the PI published an HRS study reporting that physical functional decline precedes the onset of diabetes, a risk factor for ADRD. Our proposal builds on this work. The successful completion of the proposed study will ascertain the extent to which self-reported impairment in physical function during midlife, predicts future ADRD, thereby offering a new, efficient mechanism for early identification of ADRD. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple worldwide by 2050 unless effective measures to treat or delay the onset of the disease are implemented.1 The same study found that about 35% of ADRD could be delayed or prevented through modifiable health and lifestyle factors from different phases of life. To identify adults at risk of ADRD early, our study among adults aged 51-59 seeks to determine the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function are early indicators of ADRD and to identify sub-groups of people with unique patterns of limitation in physical function that are early indicators of ADRD.",The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD,10106121,R03AG070668,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Blood', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Financial Hardship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Muscle', 'Nursing Homes', 'Observational Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive measure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Subjects Selections', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'dementia risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'grasp', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'performance based measurement', 'prevent']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,287889
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,10167620,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Diet therapy', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'dietary', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,1524872
"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Project Narrative Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will develop a new version of existing software so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",10271571,U24EB028990,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Budgets', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health behavior', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SMART health', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoking', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief intervention', 'burden of illness', 'comparison intervention', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'good diet', 'handheld mobile device', 'healthy weight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'open data', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reduced substance use', 'repository', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'software development', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,377490
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Association of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Cardiac Electrical Instability: A Twin Study ABSTRACT Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), but unfortunately not studied very well. This may in part be is due to the fact that many SCDs are unwitnessed, which makes the study of SCD triggers difficult. As a possible solution to this problem, we propose to study electrocardiographic (ECG) markers of cardiac electrical instability in a cohort of 1,000 Veteran male twins who are recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Dr. Shah is an Early Stage Investigator who is poised to lead this effort that follows from his previous work on arrhythmia risk due to acute mental stress (K23 HL127251). His team includes several established investigators in the field of PTSD and heart disease (Viola Vaccarino, Douglas Bremner), stress and arrhythmia (Rachel Lampert), and signal processing/mobile health technologies (Gari Clifford, Larry Jamner). Dr. Shah, over the past several years, has worked closely with the Vietnam veteran twins and is an experienced investigator with this cohort. They have generated important preliminary data that demonstrates a potential relationship between PTSD and TWA; in addition, they have demonstrated feasibility of studying Veterans continuously for one week in their currently funded study which measures PTSD, autonomic function, and sleep. Dr. Shah is also leading telehealth efforts at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which has provided important methodologies for the current study to recruit and enroll participants from around the United States remotely. The first aim seeks to evaluate the relationship of PTSD symptoms and cardiac electrical instability using two ECG-based markers for arrhythmia: microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA) and morphological beat variability (MVB). Both are expected to be associated with higher PTSD symptoms, suggesting an acutely increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The relationship is also hypothesized to be moderated by genetic factors: when adjusting for genetic factors by evaluating monozygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD, the relationship is attenuated. Aim 2 examines the relationship between everyday PTSD symptoms with an ecological momentary assessment and MVB/TWA. We hypothesize that acute increases in PTSD symptoms and stress also increase cardiac electrical instability, measured by higher TWA and MVB. Finally, aim 3 explores fragmented sleep and other behavioral correlates of PTSD as possible mechanisms through which PTSD may indirectly impact SCD risk through modifiable behaviors. Our hypothesis is that sleep fragmentation and other maladaptive behaviors such as low physical activity will result higher TWA/MVB on a daily basis. Overall, Dr. Shah is a poised and well-equipped to carry out this large project with novel methods and unprecedented reach in terms of impact and  Project Narrative Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death and can cause cardiac electrical instability. This study aims to address the reasons behind sudden cardiac death by evaluating the relationship of cardiac electrical instability with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We will also study the way in which PTSD-related genes, sleep disturbance, and physical inactivity may also play a role in its potential relationship with cardiac electrical risk.",Association of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Cardiac Electrical Instability: A Twin Study,10299148,R01HL155711,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Acute Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Address', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Attenuated', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health Technology', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Fragmentations', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Ventricular', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Viola', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biobehavior', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'male', 'men', 'modifiable behavior', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'poor sleep', 'prospective', 'psychological trauma', 'recruit', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'sleep behavior', 'stress related disorder', 'sudden cardiac death', 'telehealth', 'traumatic stress', 'virtual']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,741461
"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain and by shaping exposures to environmental hazards (e.g., air pollution, extreme temperatures, noise); however, developing accurate, time- varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to build causal relationships between the built environment and CVD and to inform policy-relevant, actionable interventions.

"Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors ABSTRACT Cancer survivors are a growing population in the United States; more than 16 million currently live in the US and by 2030 this number is expected to exceed 22 million. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of new cancer cases could be eliminated through a combination of healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity and healthy diet); and cancer survivors are at high risk for developing new and recurrent cancer. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of cancer survivors are not attaining the cancer preventive guidelines of healthy diet and physical activity. In the past few decades, a variety of telephone-based lifestyle interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in helping survivors meet cancer preventive guidelines, however these trials are labor intensive and expensive to deliver, limiting their potential for broad dissemination. We propose to address this hurdle by taking advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to reduce the cost and maximize the impact of these much-needed interventions. Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are analytical techniques that automatically learn from direct and indirect patterns in data. We propose to use machine learned algorithms to analyze speech to aid in predicting who may be at risk of poor adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. These speech data will come from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) study, a telephone-based lifestyle intervention testing whether a diet low in fat and high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber, coupled with increased physical activity will increase time to disease progression in 1200 ovarian cancer survivors who have recently completed treatment, as compared to an attention control. Intervention coaches employed motivational interviewing to elicit behavior change and all calls on the LIVES trial were recorded with repeat assessments of diet, physical activity, patient reported and clinical outcomes. We will use this existing and robust longitudinal data set, which pairs conversational speech data with explicit outcomes, to achieve the following objectives. 1) Develop a ML model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change in diet and physical activity given the comprehensive LIVES data set, utilizing voice recorded calls, demographics, and clinical and patient reported outcomes collected at multiple time points. 2) Decompose the ML model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to the intervention protocol, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting behavior change, as well as adherence to intervention goals. This decomposition will directly enable early and targeted adjustments to intervention plans for individuals, reducing the cost and increasing the efficacy of intervention strategies. ML and NLP methods can produce models that listen to a coaching conversation and automatically predict whether it will result in positive change towards enactment of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Such predictive models would enable more efficient, effective, and individualized lifestyle interventions, the first step towards personalized behavioral medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study examines whether artificial intelligence can use speech and audio from health coaching calls to predict who is most likely to enact healthy lifestyle behaviors of diet and physical activity. This project uses previously collected data from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian Cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) Study to 1) Develop a machine learning model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change of healthy lifestyle and 2) Decompose the machine learning model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to fidelity protocols, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting healthy lifestyle behavior change and adherence to intervention goals.",Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors,10109452,R21CA256680,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Fruit', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trial of Labor', 'United States', 'Vegetables', 'Voice', 'anticancer research', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral adherence', 'behavioral outcome', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'demographics', 'experience', 'good diet', 'healthy lifestyle', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2021,209312
"Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is responsive to NIH solicitation PA-17-089 for projects involving secondary analysis of pre-existing geriatric datasets. While presently there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, existing literature indicates that early diagnosis in the preclinical stage, i.e., before the onset of clinical symptoms, will be key to treatments. There is a pressing need for noninvasive predictors of cognitive decline that can enable early identification of individuals at Alzheimer’s disease risk. A mounting body of scientific evidence suggests that sleep disturbances (including microarchitectural disruptions to non-rapid-eye-motion sleep and decline in sleep quality) might be the earliest observable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. On-the-go sleep and activity monitoring could address the need for noninvasive indicators of cognitive decline in subjects who are in the (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we will build on preliminary results that reveal a set of sleep features derived from polysomnography (PSG) that are predictive of cognitive performance. We are proposing to perform secondary analysis of sleep and cognition data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort using state-of-the-art deep learning tools to enable sleep-based prediction of cognitive impairment for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. While PSG is the gold standard for sleep measurement, it is not well- suited for routine, day-to-day use. In comparison, wrist-based measurements (e.g. actigraphy, heart rate, ECG, and pulse oximetry) obtained from wearable devices allow “on-the-go” sleep monitoring. The combination of these on-the-go measures with the latest artificial intelligence tools is a feasible route to early Alzheimer’s diagnostics. We will use attention-guided long short-term memory autoencoders to identify overt and latent characteristics of the raw time-series datasets, which will allow us to more effectively mine the rich MESA data resource. Our deep learning framework will also take into account sociodemographic variables, indicators of health status, and medications. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the MESA-trained deep learning models will be performed on PSG and actigraphy data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, which is a longitudinal study designed to further our understanding of what differentiates normal aging from preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To address any concern about the “black-box” nature of deep learning models, we will compare the learned feature set with sleep microarchitectural features previously computed using classical statistical techniques. Previous data suggests that a subject’s apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE4) allele carrier status influences the degree to which their sleep patterns impact their cognitive abilities. We will verify this by incorporating ApoE4 status as an additional input to the deep learning model. Literature shows that over 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease have at least one clinical sleep disorder. The on-the-go prediction paradigm using noninvasive sleep measurements to be validated in this project will have a significant impact on early Alzheimer’s diagnostics and facilitate ongoing clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are a common feature of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease before the onset of symptoms would be critically important for disease management and therapeutics. In this R21 Exploratory Analyses Grant, we propose to develop and validate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to discover novel sleep-based predictors for Alzheimer’s disease through secondary analysis of sleep, activity, and cognitive data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort of human subjects.",Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics,10221599,R21AG068890,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Polysomnography', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research Design', 'Route', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging brain', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'carrier status', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'long short term memory', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'sociodemographic variables', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R21,2021,217797
"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,10294298,R00DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2021,248999
"Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers” 7. Project Summary We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system; and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine- learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio- economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus, Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement, and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline) [H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis) Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation]. To accomplish the above aims, we have brought together a multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise, and a strong track record of collaboration. 8. Narrative We propose testing Adapt2Quit — an innovative motivational texting “recommender system.” Adapt2Quit enhances tailored motivational messaging systems using machine-learning algorithms to learn from, and adapt to, user feedback (prior and daily message ratings), thereby increasing message personal relevance. Our study will test Adapt2Quit motivational messaging texting with socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) smokers.","Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers”",10146309,R01CA240551,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biochemical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Motivation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Self Determination', 'Self Efficacy', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking and Health Research', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'active control', 'base', 'behavior change', 'design', 'digital health', 'disadvantaged population', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine replacement', 'primary outcome', 'quitline', 'recruit', 'rural healthcare', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,644137
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,10063429,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer science', 'craving', 'dietary', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obese person', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2021,165181
"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation. If successful, this intervention can be cost-effectively scaled on a population level, thereby making a high public health impact.",Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation,10120658,R01CA247156,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antismoking', 'Car Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Cost Measures', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empathy', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Health behavior change', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social support', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Trust', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'patient engagement', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized effectiveness trial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'sex', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'text messaging intervention', 'web site']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,730398
"Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Depression has an enormous impact: it is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 264 million people of all ages. Moreover, major depression at any age doubles the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias, which affect over 50 million people worldwide — a number projected to triple by 2050. Interventions for depression in older adults have limited efficacy to date, and directly treating cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer’s Disease is not feasible or effective. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors that favorably influence both depression and cognition before dementia onset is an urgent public health need. Sleep is one such risk factor. However, sleep is not a uni-dimensional construct represented by merely its duration or the presence/absence of a sleep disorder. Rather sleep is multidimensional: it is comprised of multiple domains (e.g., Regularity, Satisfaction, Sleepiness, Timing, Efficiency, Duration) and measured on multiple levels (e.g. self-report or behavioral [via actigraphy]). In our initial R01, we leveraged our biostatistical and sleep expertise to develop and hone methods for examining multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of mortality in a high- dimensional machine learning (ML) context that flexibly accounts for the complex interactions that exist among sleep and non-sleep risk factors. We now seek to build on the success of the initial funding period by using our novel methods to examine multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of changes in cognition and depressive symptoms. To enhance generalizability and power, we are developing a Pooled Sample of N~3,400 adults aged ≥65 without cognitive impairment from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study, Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS). With these methods and data, we will examine multidimensional sleep health for predicting changes in global cognition and incident dementia (Aim 1) and depressive symptoms (Aim 2) in a high-dimensional machine learning context. We will also examine depression as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts impaired cognition (Aim 3). Our Secondary Aims are to: (a) apply parallel methods in two additional cohorts (the Rotterdam Study and Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) to replicate and extend our findings to cohorts with different demographic profiles and clinical Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias diagnoses; (b) examine effects by sex and race; and (c) identify the sleep health characteristics driving overall effects. Identifying multidimensional sleep health profiles that reliably predict changes in global cognition, incident dementia, and changes in depressive symptoms in a realistic, high dimensional context will directly inform the design of novel targeted interventions and prospective studies focused on preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. Moreover, we will amplify the impact of our work by demonstrating new methods for studying health and depositing harmonized data on the National Sleep Research Resource to facilitate future multi-cohort secondary analyses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias are among the leading contributors to morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. This project will apply novel machine learning techniques to large multi-cohort samples to determine whether multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes (change in cognition, incident dementia; Aim 1) and change in depressive symptoms (Aim 2), and examine depressive symptoms as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes. Through our multi-cohort secondary data analysis approach, which offers enhanced generalizability and power and an efficient use of existing resources, our findings will directly inform the design of subsequent prospective studies aimed at developing integrated approaches to treating depression and cognitive decline in older adults, with implications for preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias.",Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications,10209375,RF1AG056331,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'European', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guide prevention', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sex Differences', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'sleep-focused interventions', 'sociodemographic factors', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,RF1,2021,1968065
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,10207620,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,482164
"Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes PROJECT SUMMARY  Ambulatory assessment (AA) techniques (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, daily diaries, experiencing sampling) have provided critical tests of theories about the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) by identifying within-person processes (such as negative or reinforcement, stress exposure, or social context) that can raise the risk for problem drinking and in turn AUD. AA methods are the leading methodological approach in the push towards personalized medicine because it provides a compelling platform for assessment, diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and just-in-time interventions. However, the current utility of AA for personalized models of AUD risk is limited because risky drinking and the risk factors for it (such as changes in moods, stress, or social contexts) change at different scales of time. In other words, even heavy drinkers may only drink a few times a week, but their emotions, stressors and social contexts change multiple times a day. Current AA methods that rely on self-report data have to sample frequently enough to be sensitive to change, long enough to observe sufficient drinking episodes, and to do so while avoiding participant burnout. Passive mobile sensing, which uses sensors (such as GPS, accelerometer, light meter, etc.) available on most smartphones, has been shown in preliminary studies to predict the probability of drinking episodes, but those studies have used relatively small samples. The present career development award aims to develop the candidate’s expertise in passive mobile sensing and the machine learning methods used to analyze passive mobile sensing data. The research proposal will analyze passive mobile sensing data collected in a large sample of regular drinking and marijuana using young adults (age 18 – 22, n = 500; 95.2% who drink), who will be followed using AA over 8 successive weekends as part of a parent R01 (DA 047247). The research goal is to identify passive mobile sensing models of risk factors for drinking (stress, social contexts, sleep, mood, and impulsive states), as well as the drinking episodes themselves. The candidate will develop expertise in these methods and models that will further the development of a research program aimed at developing person specific models of risk for AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The career development plan will develop expertise of the investigator in the collection and analysis of passive mobile sensing data, with an emphasis on the application of machine learning methods. The proposed research study will use passive mobile sensing data in a large ambulatory assessment sample of regular drinkers, to develop models linking passive mobile sensing data with predictors of drinking episodes (such as stress, social context, and impulsiveness) and the drinking episodes themselves.",Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes,10102612,K02AA028832,"['Accelerometer', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Collection', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotions', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Impulsivity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'analytical method', 'burnout', 'career development', 'data streams', 'design', 'diaries', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk drinking', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'meter', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research study', 'sensor', 'stressor', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2021,142338
"Novel machine learning and missing data methods for improving estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep using accelerometer data PROJECT SUMMARY We propose novel statistical and machine learning methods for processing and analyzing accelerometer data for studying physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep and their effects on outcomes such as cardiovascular health. Methods to accurately estimate and characterize physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep are crucially needed. Accelerometers have been widely adopted as the standard objective measure of movement in free-living humans. Recent advances have spawned instruments that collect enormous amounts of data that has far outpaced the research community’s ability to meaningfully interpret them. Current studies rely on outdated methods for identifying non-wear and addressing missing data, potentially yielding biased and inefficient estimates of relationships between behavioral activity patterns and outcomes. Importantly, methods for distinguishing between non-wear periods and those that represent sedentary behavior or sleep have not been validated using a gold standard in free-living contexts. The handling of non-wear periods using a statistically valid approach that exploits the multivariate and time- series nature of the data has yet to be developed. Thus, new methods are needed to address current gaps. We propose developing and validating an ensemble classifier to distinguish non-wear time. We will adapt and validate multiple imputation methods that exploit the multivariate and time-series nature of the data to handle non-wear time in analyses that make use of entire profiles of physical activity. Specifically, we will evaluate methods for incorporating multiple imputation for handling missing data from non-wear when applying adaptive clustering algorithms to identify distinct patterns of sleep and activity in order to relate them to outcomes in a generalized linear mixed effects model framework. We will create open-source user-friendly software that can be adopted and enhanced by the research community. Our approach integrates three novel data resources to develop our methods – two with knowledge of true activity and non-wear, and a third generated from a unique four-year longitudinal time series for both accelerometry and cardiovascular risk factor measures in a real- world setting. It offers an opportunity to develop and illustrate methods using data generated from wearable devices in a natural environment that includes missing data. This is the first study to incorporate missing data methods into learning algorithms under a generalized linear mixed effects model framework for accelerometer studies. Such methods will be critical for both observational and clinical trial research in real-world settings, where wear and non-wear time are not directly observed. The resulting insights and tools will also be highly applicable to the processing and analysis of other types of intensively sampled serial data, such as those generated from mobile digital devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to fill important gaps in current methods by developing a comprehensive set of tools to analyze accelerometer data to better understand the links between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep and outcomes such as cardiovascular health, and to make open-source user-friendly software available to apply them. We propose methods to identify and account for non-wear periods through machine learning and multiple imputation approaches under a generalized linear mixed effects model framework in order to correlate behaviors with outcomes. The methods we develop and validate will be useful for studying questions of great importance to public health such as identifying signature patterns of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep that may be favorable for cardiovascular health and will provide insights into analytic approaches for studies that involve other types of monitoring data with public health relevance.","Novel machine learning and missing data methods for improving estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep using accelerometer data",10120571,R01LM013355,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'Gaussian model', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'data resource', 'diabetes risk', 'digital', 'health data', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'open source', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'simulation', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep pattern', 'standard measure', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'waist circumference', 'wearable device']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,328975
"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,10146274,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2021,118800
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10264175,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutically effective', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2021,521758
"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10259878,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical outcome measures', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'digital health', 'digital intervention', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,714718
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,10162316,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,581743
"Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice ABSTRACT: Chronic psychological stress triggers and exacerbates major depressive disorder (MDD) and many other psychiatric conditions – causing changes in sleep, eating habits, addictive behaviors, activity levels, circadian rhythms, mood and other domains. The rodent stress response shares many behavioral and physiologic alterations with that of humans. Chronic stress also has broad effects on the brain. But major gaps exist in our knowledge in regard to the integrated behavior and physiology as well as the corresponding brain circuit changes with chronic stress. Prior work has found many behavioral and physiologic phenotypes of stress, but we lack a cohesive sense of how these variables co-evolve over time. Our first aim is to delineate this co-evolution of stress response elements in stressed versus unstressed mice. We will accomplish this by examining mice under a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm versus controls in our new naturalistic observation system the “Digital Homecage”. This system allows us to monitor over 50 behavioral measures simultaneously over weeks. Mice will live in these homecages for 8 weeks: 2 weeks baseline, 4 weeks CUS and 2 weeks of recovery. An exploratory element of that aim is to use machine learning to determine a coherent mouse stress biomarker for future quantitative studies. Our next goal is to determine electrophysiologic signatures of chronic stress. It is known that chronic stress alters brain circuit synaptic structure and neuromodulatory balance. It is known that the behavior is controlled by the electrophysiologic state of brain networks and that those networks operate both locally within regions and via coordinated multi-regional transmission. Therefore, we aim to study changes in electrophysiology both within and across regions. We focus on the medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral hippocampus and infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex given their strong involvement in chronic stress. We will implant tetrode arrays into these regions and will record over 8 weeks as above. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of chronic stress on within-region spiking tendencies including spike rate variability and excitatory- inhibitory balance. In a second part of this aim we will use machine learning applied to a wider variety of within- region dynamical measures to determine a potentially more complete set of differences between CUS and control mice. In our final Aim, we will assess cross-regional coordination between these 3 regions. We will test the hypothesis that pairwise coupling between regions will be altered in a manner consistent with MDD by measuring coupling using both spiking and LFP. Again, we will then use machine learning methods on our large dataset to detect further inter-regional dynamics un-revealed in our hypothesis-driven testing. This mixture of behavior and electrophysiology is done to generate new understanding about chronic stress. We also have a long-term vision of creating large dataset for future analysis, a fully-refined Digital Homecage system for future studies, with an eye towards developing interventions based on natural electrophysiologic circuit function. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stress has a central role in mental health conditions and improved understanding of how stress affects brain and body could deliver great potential clinical impact. To determine the brain and body responses to varying stressors we will use novel instrumentation to measure 50+ behavioral metrics at sub-second resolution together with multi-brain site electrophysiology over weeks. We will then determine how varying stressors affect circadian and broader changes across animal behavior and physiology as well as neural circuit dynamics.",Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice,10199475,R01MH126137,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body Temperature', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diet Habits', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'REM Sleep', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Solid', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Sucrose', 'Suggestion', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'circadian', 'cohesion', 'data structure', 'digital', 'field study', 'forced swim test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stressor', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,681455
"Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Advances in machine learning and low-cost, wearable sensors offer a practical method for understanding, assessing, and intervening for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) in everyday spaces. We propose to create a Behaviorome research program that will create ground-breaking methods for building health-predictive models from wearable sensor data by mapping patterns of behavior using machine learning and pervasive computing technologies. This program will create innovative multidisciplinary ideas to address NIH ADRD Milestone 11.c, Embed wearable technologies/pervasive computing in existing and new clinical research. Our research program builds on a history of interdisciplinary research contributions in areas including human behavior modeling from longitudinal sensor data and design of novel assessment and intervention mechanisms. We propose to design and validate methods for mapping a human behaviorome “in the wild”, automatically assessing cognitive and functional health from behavior markers, scaling technologies through machine learning, linking health and behavior with their influences, and closing the loop with automated interventions. Similarly, our mentoring program builds on experience training students and early- career investigators to become leaders in the field of gerontechnology. We will recruit and train graduate students and early-stage researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, to grow an institutional multidisciplinary Behaviorome research program and to establish new research programs that contribute to the targeted Milestone. We will scale the impact of mentoring by establishing a webinar series and creating youtube videos that highlight and explain breakthroughs in the design and application of Behaviorome research. Results of this program will include scripts and templates to construct a behaviorome with resource- limited wearable devices, scale data and models to large diverse populations, integrate data with multiple information sources (e.g., genetics), automate health assessment and intervention, and create understandable explanations of data and models. These will contribute to existing clinical studies such as the clinician-in-the- loop smart home, digital memory notebook, and pervasive computing measures of functional performance. Furthermore, they will lead to new clinical studies that formalize connections between health and its influences, exploration of the impact of ethnicity and the built environment on health, and the design of ADRD interventions for medication adherence, task prompting, and negative interaction de-escalation. The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on detecting and assessing ADRDs within a person's everyday environment using wearable sensing and pervasive computing methods that have not been investigated in prior work. Additionally, the mentoring steps will pave the way for a new generation of researchers to offer improved methods of addressing the need to understand, assess, and intervene for ADRDs in everyday settings, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to build a multidisciplinary research and mentoring program that will design wearable sensing and pervasive computing technologies to improve detection, assessment and intervention for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Built on a foundation of existing research and mentoring collaboration between computer science and neuropsychology, we will design and validate methods to analyze the relationship between ADRDs and behavior. We will create robust health-predictive models from longitudinal sensor data collected in naturalistic settings and will connect health and behavior with multiple influences, such as genetics and environment, to advance quality of care and reduce functional disability associated with ADRDs.","Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs",10168052,R35AG071451,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'built environment', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'graduate student', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'student training', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'webinar']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,918000
"Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use Project Summary Although enormous progress has been made in reducing cigarette smoking in the United States, large disparities remain across subpopulations such as racial minorities. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of disease and early death. However, African Americans (AA) are less likely to quit smoking successfully than are non-Hispanic Whites, and they are also three times more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than Whites. There is a remarkable variation in the incidence of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking among racial/ethnic groups in the United States, and African Americans have significantly greater risks than Whites at lower levels of smoking. Tobacco use landscape is changing among U.S. adults with an estimated 4.5% of adults aged 18 years and older reporting current use of electronic cigarettes (EC). Evidence suggests that e-cigarette aerosol is substantially less toxic than combustible cigarette smoking, but e-cigarette use may also post elevated risk for former smokers to relapse back to combustible cigarette smoking. Biomarker can play an important role in assessing the potential health effects of tobacco products and studies have found that AA have higher levels of serum cotinine per cigarette smoked, higher urinary amount of TNE and NNAL than Whites. However, evidence on the racial disparities of biomarker outcomes of EC use is scarce, especially whether and to what extent they are different from use of various EC devices, flavors, and transitions in EC ↔ cigarettes. The overarching goal of this study is to examine the racial disparities in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants in association with EC use by analyzing the restricted Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Wave 1-4 biomarker data. We will link the biomarker data with the PATH adult surveys to identify the between- person and within-person differences in biomarkers by use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition in EC and combustible cigarettes across different waves (Aim 1). We will further leverage machine learning algorithms to develop a composite bio (biomarker)-socio (socio-demographics) -psycho (psychosocial factors) risk index score for each racial/ethnic group to predict subsequent abstinence from cigarette smoking and relapse to cigarette smoking since these 2 outcomes represent the most meaningful transitions from a public health perspective. This study is innovative in its focus on racial disparities of biomarkers by leveraging the nationally longitudinal data, and on using machine learning algorithms to predict future smoking cessation and relapse behaviors in EC ↔ cigarette transition. Fulfillment of these aims will build a scientific base for maximizing the value of existing biospecimen collections. Findings from this R21 study are expected to inform regulatory strategies to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and set the stage for a future R01 application that will develop personalized intervention strategies that incorporate biomarker measures to reduce racial disparities in tobacco use and improve health outcomes. 1 Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine racial disparities in biomarkers of e-cigarette use by linking the PATH Waves 1-4 restricted biomarker data and adult survey data. The study will extend our knowledge on the heterogeneity in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants across racial and ethnic groups, including use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. We will further develop a bio-socio-psycho risk index score to predict abstinence from cigarette smoking, relapse to cigarette use, and tobacco-related health outcomes using machine learning algorithms across racial and ethnic groups.","Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use",10232728,R21DA054818,"['18 year old', '4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Cotinine', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Menthol', 'Metals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nicotine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cigarette smoke', 'cigarette smoking', 'cigarette user', 'combustible cigarette', 'disorder risk', 'e-cigarette aerosols', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'former smoker', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized intervention', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial minority', 'reduce tobacco use', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'sociodemographics', 'tobacco exposure', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco toxicant', 'toxicant', 'urinary', 'vaping']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,204739
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,10153459,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'efficacious treatment', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'social factors', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2021,692058
"Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks Project Summary Translational studies showing a mechanistic interplay between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and sleep/circadian disruption has renewed interest in the maxim ‘sleep is of the brain, by the brain, and for the brain’. Relative to adults sleeping well, those exhibiting sleep deficiency (SD), defined as poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment, have greater AD risk (OR=1.55), cognitive decline (OR=1.68), or preclinical AD (OR=3.78). Since SD is observed early in the course of AD, it constitutes a prime target for prevention. Notwithstanding successes in delineating the mechanisms and functions of sleep, a critical gap remains in elucidating factors undergirding sleep disparities among blacks, marked by a greater AD risk burden. Blacks also shoulder a greater sleep burden as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the main SD indices, which are linked to increased vascular risks, inflammation, brain injury, and cognitive impairment. The multi-disciplinary team will utilize innovative dynamic and geospatial modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants of SD and its putative effects on the brain health of older blacks. We will leverage the success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup, comprising investigators with expertise in aging research, translational sleep and circadian sciences, brain health, health disparities, and geospatial and multi-level dynamic modeling. We will leverage the social capital and assets of our Community Steering Committee to enroll 504 blacks (60-75 years) from traditional and non-traditional venues to capture study endpoints. We will investigative the following aims: 1) To ascertain the psychosocial (social/emotional support, mood, discrimination, attitudes) and environmental (household [density, noise, air quality, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with SD; 2) To assess effects of SD on markers of brain injury (Hcy, NFL, GFAP, Tau & Amyloid-β peptides) and on neurocognitive functions (attention, language, memory, and executive function using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and Trail Making Test). The contributions of vascular risk (obesity, BP, lipid, and glucose/HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) will be weighted; 3) To characterize blacks who are at increased risk of SD using Bayesian machine-learning modeling and forecast through Agent-Based modeling which amalgamation of psychosocial and environmental changes will lead to a reduced SD burden and related brain health profile among older blacks over time (5, 10, & 20 yrs.). The investigative team will use novel home-based digital recorders, innovative brain health biomarkers, geospatial analytics and dynamic systems modeling to describe the mechanisms of SD and delineate their potential role in explaining observed disparities in markers of brain health of older blacks. Project Narrative Despite the high risk for sleep-related morbidity, there is a paucity of data on sleep-disrupting psychosocial and environmental stressors associated with sleep deficiency (poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment) among older blacks. Our multi-disciplinary team will use novel mHealth devices recording sleep/activity cycles, light, noise, air quality, temperature, and greenspace exposure; novel brain biomarkers; and geospatial analytics to assess effects on sleep deficiency and delineate their role in explaining disparities in the brain and cognitive health of older blacks.",Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks,10149911,R01AG067523,"['Activity Cycles', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Aphorisms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shoulder', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Strategic Planning', 'TNF gene', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Trail Making Test', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'age related', 'base', 'brain health', 'built environment', 'career', 'circadian', 'cognitive function', 'density', 'digital', 'disparity reduction', 'dynamic system', 'environmental change', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic minority population', 'executive function', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'poor sleep', 'pre-clinical', 'psychosocial', 'psychosocial stressors', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social capital', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'translational study', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,824854
