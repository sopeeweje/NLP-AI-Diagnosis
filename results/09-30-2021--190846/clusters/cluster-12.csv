"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,9735964,R01LM010090,"['Address', 'Apache', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Image', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohesion', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning community', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social media', 'symptom treatment', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,626851,0.020803738337968
"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. We have therefore focused on recognizing various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc, and their relationships.   Built upon our previous success with PubTator which has served annotated PubMed abstracts for 300 million requests, we expanded its scope to include automated concept annotations for full-length articles in the newly released PubTator Central (PTC) system. Specifically, PTC annotates PubMed (29 million abstracts) and the PMC Text Mining subset (3 million full text articles). Annotations are downloadable in multiple formats (XML, JSON and tab delimited) via the online interface, a RESTful web service and bulk FTP. Improved concept identification systems and a new disambiguation module based on deep learning increase annotation accuracy, and the new server-side architecture is significantly faster.   To facilitate research in the development of pre-training language representations in the biomedicine domain, we introduced the Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (BLUE) benchmark. The benchmark consists of five tasks with ten datasets that cover both biomedical and clinical texts with different dataset sizes and difficulties. We also evaluate several baselines based on BERT and ELMo and find that the BERT model pre-trained on PubMed abstracts and MIMIC-III clinical notes achieves the best results. We make the datasets, pre-trained models, and codes publicly available.   In 2019, we developed ML-Net, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework, for multi-label classification of biomedical texts where each document is associated with one or more labels. As an important task that has broad applications in biomedicine, a number of different computational methods have been proposed. Many of these methods, however, have only modest accuracy or efficiency and limited success in practical use. Our ML-Net method combines a label prediction network with an automated label count prediction mechanism to provide an optimal set of labels. This is accomplished by leveraging both the predicted confidence score of each label and the deep contextual information (modeled by ELMo) in the target document. Our benchmarking results show that ML-Net compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods in multi-label classification of biomedical text. ML-Net is also shown to be robust when evaluated on different text genres in biomedicine.   In addition to tackling text-mining tasks with supervised machine-learning methods that typically require a large amount of annotated labeled data for algorithm training, we proposed a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm based on variational autoencoders (VAE) in order to utilize unlabeled data to reduce the burden of manual annotation required in supervised learning. Our model consists of the following three parts, a classifier, an encoder and a decoder. The classifier is implemented using multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the encoder and decoder are implemented using both bidirectional long short-term memory networks (Bi-LSTMs) and CNNs, respectively. The semi-supervised mechanism allows our model to learn features from both the labeled and unlabeled data. We evaluate our method on multiple public PPI, DDI and CPI corpora. Experimental results show that our method effectively exploits the unlabeled data to improve the performance and reduce the dependence on labeled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised VAE-based method for (biomedical) relation extraction.   As mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we organized a challenge task on text mining for precision medicine through BioCreative VI. The challenge was organized in two specific sub-tasks: (i) document triage subtask, focused on identifying scientific literature containing experimentally verified protein-protein interactions (PPIs) affected by genetic mutations and (ii) relation extraction subtask, focused on extracting the affected interactions (protein pairs). To assist system developers and task participants, a large-scale corpus of PubMed documents was manually annotated for this task. Ten teams worldwide contributed 22 distinct text-mining models for the document triage task, and six teams worldwide contributed 14 different text-mining systems for the relation extraction task.  Separately, we have applied cutting-edge deep learning techniques to the literature triage process for human kinome curation and the identification of translational research in genomic medicine beyond bench to bedside from the biomedical literature. In both applications, automated computer results are compared and validated by the expert curators of the two databases: neXtA5 and the CDCs Public Health Genomics Knowledge Base. Both results show that our deep-learning based computer method is more efficient and can replace the traditional manual triage methods of those databases. Our methods can give human curators more time to focus on more challenging tasks such as actual curation as well as the discovery of novel papers/experimental techniques to consider for inclusion.  As shown above, deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, has showed impressive results in several of our recent studies this year. In addition to applying it to natural language processing, we have also seen its success in our medical image analysis such as processing chest X-rays, CT images, and various kinds of retinal images for autonomous disease diagonosis and prognosis. One such project relates to Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries and, by 2040, will affect approximately 300 million people worldwide. Accurate AMD severity detection and progression prediction to sight-threatening late disease stage is thus of significant importance for personalizing monitoring and preventative interventions. As a joint effort between National Library of Medicine and National Eye Institute, we developed novel machine-learning approaches to automatically classify AMD severity levels and predict risk of progression to late AMD based on retinal images taken from two US multi-center longitudinal studies. We demonstrated that the fully automated deep learning model was superior to existing clinical standards and has the potential for improved patient care. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,10007525,ZIALM091813,"['Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'E-learning', 'Evaluation', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'National Eye Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'formycin triphosphate', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'long short term memory network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'protein protein interaction', 'retinal imaging', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'text searching', 'web services']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2019,1901416,0.047890131086824085
"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9747967,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,514129,0.06447116860245052
"Semantic Relation Extraction from Biomedical Text - Methods and Applications SemRep exploits UMLS knowledge resources to identify semantic predications and is made available to the research community as a stand-alone system. Current SemRep research and development involves enhancing linguistic processing for increased accuracy as well as migrating its codebase to Java for more efficient development. SemRep additionally supports two other resources that we provide to the research community. SemMedDB is a PubMed-scale repository of semantic predications extracted from biomedical abstracts (more than 98 million predications as of December 31, 2018). Semantic MEDLINE is a web application that combines semantic predications with document retrieval, abstractive summarization, and visualization techniques and allows users to navigate the biomedical literature using concepts and relations between them. These resources have been widely used as the basis for practical tasks, such as identification of drug interactions and adverse effects, hypothesis generation, and literature-based discovery. Current work on SemMedDB focuses on providing more contextual information about the semantic predications in SemMedDB, including their rhetorical category (IMRAD), factuality status, and evidence level. We are also exploring different distribution options for SemMedDB, such as neo4j graph database and RDF triplestore, to provide new aggregation and reasoning capabilities.  Recently, we have also been using information extraction methods more broadly to assess scientific rigor and translatability of biomedical research, in collaboration with extramural researchers. For example, a recent study focused on automatic recognition of limitations in clinical research literature. A current study aims to assess adherence of clinical trial publications to CONSORT reporting guidelines for increased transparency and reproducibility. Other work in this area includes extraction of study characteristics (e.g., species, models, interventions, outcomes) from PubMed abstracts to allow a large-scale unbiased analysis of variables relevant to translatability of pre-clinical animal studies, as well as fine-grained citation analysis for enhanced bibliometrics. n/a",Semantic Relation Extraction from Biomedical Text - Methods and Applications,10016944,ZIALM010012,"['Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Bibliometrics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Interactions', 'Extramural Activities', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Health Professional', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Level of Evidence', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Object Relations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'base', 'empowered', 'information organization', 'pre-clinical', 'repository', 'research and development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'web app']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2019,1184679,0.06400475907590228
"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems.

"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. We have therefore focused on recognizing various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc, and their relationships.   Synonyms pose another challenge for high quality relevance searches. This is a problem for ordinary words, but it is even more of a difficult for entities that can be named in a number of different ways. LitVar address this problem for genetic variants. For example, searching for one of A146T, c.436G>A, or rs121913527 also finds instances of the other two. The goal is to extend this ability to other entity types.  We participated in The CHEMPROT track at BioCreative VI, which aims to assess the state of the art in automatically extracting the chemicalprotein relations in running text (PubMed abstracts). We proposed an ensemble of three systems, including a support vector machine, a convolutional neural network, and a recurrent neural network. Their output is combined using majority voting or stacking for final predictions. Our system obtained 0.7266 in precision and 0.5735 in recall for an F-score of 0.6410 during the challenge, achieving the highest performance among all team submissions during the challenge.  In addition to tackling relation extraction tasks with supervised machine-learning methods, we proposed a novel adversarial learning algorithm for unsupervised domain adaptation tasks where no labeled data are available in the target domain. We show domain invariant features can be learned in the latest neural networks such that classifiers trained for one relation type (proteinprotein) can be re-purposed to others (drugdrug). Compared to prior convolutional and recurrent NN-based relation classification methods without domain adaptation, we achieve improvements as high as 30% in F1-score. To further assist NLP tasks without pre-existing training data, we developed ezTag, a web-based annotation tool that allows users to perform annotation and provide training data with humans in the loop. ezTag supports both abstracts in PubMed and full-text articles in PubMed Central.  Negative and uncertain medical findings are frequent in radiology reports, but discriminating them from positive findings remains challenging for information extraction. Here, we propose a new algorithm, NegBio, to detect negative and uncertain findings in radiology reports. Unlike previous rule-based methods, NegBio utilizes patterns on universal dependencies to identify the scope of triggers that are indicative of negation or uncertainty. We evaluated NegBio on four datasets, including two public benchmarking corpora of radiology reports, a new radiology corpus that we annotated for this work, and a public corpus of general clinical texts. Evaluation on these datasets demonstrates that NegBio is highly accurate for detecting negative and uncertain findings and compares favorably to the current state of the art.   One promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we applied automated deep learning techniques to the literature triage process of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog for genomic variation by collaborating with their database curators. Both the manual curation teams confirmed that our method achieved higher precision than their previous query-based triage methods without compromising recall. Both results show that our method is more efficient and can replace the traditional query-based triage methods of manually curated databases. Our method can give human curators more time to focus on more challenging tasks such as actual curation as well as the discovery of novel papers/experimental techniques to consider for inclusion.  Deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, has showed impressive results in several of our recent studies as shown above in FY18.

Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution. Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data.",Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science,9614770,R01LM008111,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Fruit', 'Funding', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart failure', 'Hybrids', 'Information Distribution', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Network-based', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'cohort', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'design and construction', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'light weight', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'online resource', 'ontology development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2018,538700,0.028960661859505632
"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,9521525,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'community based participatory research', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'lexical', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,356845,0.004661089608729988
"Bio Text NLP ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Since our last renewal, the challenges for biomedical researchers of keeping up with the scientific literature have become even more acute. Last year marked the first time that Medline indexed more than a million journal articles; more than 210,000 of these had full text deposited in PubMedCentral, bringing the total number of full texts archived in PMC to over 3 million. The stunning pleiotropy of genes and their products, combined with the adoption of genome-scale technologies throughout biomedical research, has made obsolete the notion that reading within one's own specialty plus a few ""top"" journals is enough to keep track of all of the results relevan to one's research. Fortunately, advances in biomedical natural language processing and increasing access to digital full text journal publications offer the potential for innovative new approaches to delivering relevant information to working bench scientists.         We hypothesize that realizing the potential of biomedical natural language processing applied to full text journal articles to make a sustained and powerful contribution to biomedical research requires contextualizing Biomedical natural language processing in the daily life of bench scientists, focusing on their unmet information gathering needs, and providing interfaces that fit well into existing research workflows.

"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals).

"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web.

"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems. The Protégé resource provides critical semantic-technology infrastructure and expertise for biomedical research and the development of advanced clinical information systems.",Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences,9404042,R01GM121724,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Education and Outreach', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Letters', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'document outlines', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,564487,0.15242736337926718
"Semantic Relation Extraction from Biomedical Text - Methods and Applications SemRep exploits UMLS knowledge resources to identify semantic predications and is made available to the research community as a stand-alone system. Current SemRep research and development involves enhancing linguistic processing for increased accuracy as well as migrating its codebase to Java for more efficient development. SemRep additionally supports two other resources that we provide to the research community. SemMedDB is a PubMed-scale repository of semantic predications extracted from biomedical abstracts (more than 94 million predications as of December 31, 2017). Semantic MEDLINE is a web application that combines semantic predications with document retrieval, abstractive summarization, and visualization techniques and allows users to navigate the biomedical literature using concepts and relations between them. These resources have been widely used as the basis for practical tasks, such as identification of drug interactions and adverse effects, hypothesis generation, and literature-based discovery. Current work on SemMedDB focuses on providing more contextual information about the semantic predications in SemMedDB, including their rhetorical category (IMRAD), factuality status, and evidence level. We are also exploring different distribution options for SemMedDB, such as graph databases and RDF triplestores, to provide new aggregation and reasoning capabilities.  Recently, we have also been using information extraction methods more broadly to assess scientific rigor and translatability of biomedical research, in collaboration with extramural researchers. A recent study focused on automatic recognition of limitations in clinical research literature. A follow-up study aims to assess adherence of clinical trial publications to CONSORT reporting guidelines for increased reproducibility. Other work in this area includes extraction of study characteristics (e.g., species, models, interventions, outcomes) from PubMed abstracts to allow a large-scale unbiased analysis of variables relevant to translatability of pre-clinical animal studies, as well as fine-grained citation analysis for enhanced bibliometrics. n/a",Semantic Relation Extraction from Biomedical Text - Methods and Applications,9787047,ZIALM010012,"['Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Bibliometrics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Interactions', 'Extramural Activities', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Health Professional', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Level of Evidence', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Object Relations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'base', 'empowered', 'information organization', 'pre-clinical', 'repository', 'research and development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'web app']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2018,885394,0.06446201811369576
"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,9407024,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2018,395628,0.05149949111273752
"PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Biomedical ontologies are critical to the accurate representation and integration of genome-scale data in biomedical and clinical research. The Protein Ontology (PRO)-the reference ontology for protein entities in the OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry-represents protein families, multiple protein forms (proteoforms) arising from single genes, and protein complexes. This competitive renewal grant application will further establish PRO as a scalable, flexible, collaborative research infrastructure for protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data of increasing volume and complexity. Specific aims are to: (i) enable scalable and dynamic representation of protein types; (ii) provide comprehensive coverage of human proteoforms in their biological context; (iii) develop collaborative use cases and support an expanding community of users to advance protein-disease understanding; and (iv) broaden dissemination to support semantic computing, dynamic term mapping, and interoperability and reusability. We will increase PRO coverage by semi-automated import of proteoforms and complexes from curated databases and via established text mining approaches. Expert curation will focus on human variant forms, post-translational modification (PTM) forms and complexes critical to disease processes, along with homologous mouse forms. We will develop a new PRO sub-ontology of protein sites-amino acid positions of significance-to enable automatic and dynamic definition of combinatoric proteoforms. We will establish PRO OWL and RDF versions and provide a SPARQL query endpoint to support semantic computing. We will organize annual workshops and annotation jamborees to develop use cases and promote PRO co-development with community collaborators to address specific disciplinary needs. PRO has several unique features. For knowledge representation, PRO defines precise protein entities to support accurate annotation at the appropriate level of granularity and provides the ontological framework to connect PTM and variant proteoforms and complexes necessary to model human health and disease. For semantic data integration, PRO provides the ontological structure to connect-via specified relations-the vast amounts of proteomics data and biomedical knowledge to support hypothesis generation and testing. PRO therefore addresses the gaps in the bioinformatics infrastructure for protein representations in a way that makes knowledge about proteins more accessible to computational reasoning, fully complementing existing knowledge sources. The proposed research will allow the PRO Consortium to deepen and broaden PRO for scalable semantic integration of biomedical data, facilitating protein-disease knowledge discovery and clinical applications by an expanding community of biomedical, clinical and computational users.

"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9275458,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,210198,0.04514016012222056
"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature is beginning to realize its potential for improving literature search, automating biological data curation, and enabling large scale studies not possible otherwise. We have therefore focused on recognizing various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc, and their relationships.   In FY17, we continued the development of our own text mining tools for named entity recognition and relation extraction. We first developed tmVar 2.0, an improvement on our previous tool for recognition of genetic variants and to normalize them to unique identifiers (dbSNP RSIDs). We validated our method by a benchmarking evaluation, where it compared favorably to the state of the art. We then applied our approach to the entire PubMed and demonstrated that combining text mining in manual database curation can greatly assist human efforts in prioritizing variants in genomic research.   Following the recognition of sequence variants, we created an extraction system for genotype-phenotype relationships. The method extracts disease-gene-variant triplets using machine learning approach that identifies the genes and protein products associated with each mutation from both the local context (same document) and global context (i.e. all of PubMed). The system was evaluated both by comparison with the entries in the human-curated database UniProt and using benchmark datasets, where it demonstrated a 28% improvement in F1-measure (from 0.62 to 0.79) over the state-of-the-art results.   While aforementioned feature-based machine learning has been the most commonly used approach for text mining for some time, deep learning methods are rapidly being adopted due to their improved performance and the reduced need for feature engineering. We created a novel deep learning model (McDepCNN) for extracting protein-protein interactions, which uses multiple channels to combine information from each word with information from the head of the corresponding word. The method is thus capable of capturing long distance features, and was shown to achieve 24.4% relative improvement in F1-score over the existing methods on cross-corpus evaluation and 12% improvement in F1-score over kernel-based methods on difficult instances.   In addition to pure methodological work, we also developed several systems which combined novel methodologies and applications with potential clinical importance. We developed the DIGNiFi (Disease causing GeNe FInder) method using machine learning and features extracted from protein-protein interaction networks to identify disease causing genes. We evaluated our method using 1184 known disease genes from 128 orphan diseases collected from Orphanet, demonstrating our method to outperform existing methods for identifying disease-causing genes. We also demonstrated that combining the human-curated protein-protein interaction network with interactions text-mined from the biomedical literature results in an additional performance improvement.   Finally, to demonstrate the utility of text mining in creating knowledge bases for large-scale studies, we created a new database containing over 100,000 labeled chest X-rays (ChestX-ray8), by text mining the associated radiological reports for eight commonly occurring thoracic diseases. We further demonstrated that these diseases can be automatically detected and even spatially-located via a unified weakly supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization framework. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,9564628,ZIALM091813,"['Adopted', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Localized Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'PubMed', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Thoracic Diseases', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'protein protein interaction', 'rapid technique', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2017,1274300,0.02062949436682788
"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text.

"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays.

"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. We will build upon the previous work of our ongoing project ""Temporal relation discovery for clinical text"" (R01LM010090) dubbed Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org) which has been focusing on methodology for event, temporal expressions and temporal relations discovery from the clinical text residing in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR). Through our participation in organizing major international bakeoffs - CLEF/ShARe 2014, SemEval 2014 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 7, SemEval 2015 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 14, SemEval 2015 Clinical TempEval Task 6 - we further disseminated the THYME resources and challenged the international research community to explore new solutions to the unsolved temporality task. Through all these activities it became clear that computational approaches to temporality still present great challenges and usability of the output is still limited. Therefore, we propose to further innovate on methodologies and end user experience.             Specific Aim 1: Extract enhanced representations and novel features to support deriving timeline information.     Specific Aim 2: Develop methods to amalgamate individual patient episode timelines into an aggregate patient-level timeline.     Specific Aim 3: Mine the EHR - the unstructured clinical text and the structured codified information - for full patient-level temporality.     Specific Aim 4: Develop a comprehensive temporal visualization tool     Specific Aim 5: Develop methodology for and perform extrinsic evaluation on specific use case.     Specific Aim 6: (1) Evaluate state-of-the-art of temporal relations through organizing international challenges under the auspices of SemEval, (2) Disseminate the results through publications, presentations, and open source code in Apache cTAKES.

"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web. These combined efforts will accelerate basic understanding of disease processes and discovery of diagnostic targets and more effective individualized therapies.",Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery,9326315,U01GM120953,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Europe', 'Event', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Post-Translational Regulation', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'collaborative environment', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'enzyme substrate', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'hackathon', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'system architecture', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,U01,2017,370434,0.04298074208531548
"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems. The Protégé resource provides critical semantic-technology infrastructure and expertise for biomedical research and the development of advanced clinical information systems.",Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences,9217457,R01GM121724,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Education and Outreach', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Letters', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'document outlines', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,578512,0.15242736337926718
"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,9193091,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2017,396248,0.05149949111273752
"PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Biomedical ontologies are critical to the accurate representation and integration of genome-scale data in biomedical and clinical research. The Protein Ontology (PRO)-the reference ontology for protein entities in the OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry-represents protein families, multiple protein forms (proteoforms) arising from single genes, and protein complexes. This competitive renewal grant application will further establish PRO as a scalable, flexible, collaborative research infrastructure for protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data of increasing volume and complexity. Specific aims are to: (i) enable scalable and dynamic representation of protein types; (ii) provide comprehensive coverage of human proteoforms in their biological context; (iii) develop collaborative use cases and support an expanding community of users to advance protein-disease understanding; and (iv) broaden dissemination to support semantic computing, dynamic term mapping, and interoperability and reusability. We will increase PRO coverage by semi-automated import of proteoforms and complexes from curated databases and via established text mining approaches. Expert curation will focus on human variant forms, post-translational modification (PTM) forms and complexes critical to disease processes, along with homologous mouse forms. We will develop a new PRO sub-ontology of protein sites-amino acid positions of significance-to enable automatic and dynamic definition of combinatoric proteoforms. We will establish PRO OWL and RDF versions and provide a SPARQL query endpoint to support semantic computing. We will organize annual workshops and annotation jamborees to develop use cases and promote PRO co-development with community collaborators to address specific disciplinary needs. PRO has several unique features. For knowledge representation, PRO defines precise protein entities to support accurate annotation at the appropriate level of granularity and provides the ontological framework to connect PTM and variant proteoforms and complexes necessary to model human health and disease. For semantic data integration, PRO provides the ontological structure to connect-via specified relations-the vast amounts of proteomics data and biomedical knowledge to support hypothesis generation and testing. PRO therefore addresses the gaps in the bioinformatics infrastructure for protein representations in a way that makes knowledge about proteins more accessible to computational reasoning, fully complementing existing knowledge sources. The proposed research will allow the PRO Consortium to deepen and broaden PRO for scalable semantic integration of biomedical data, facilitating protein-disease knowledge discovery and clinical applications by an expanding community of biomedical, clinical and computational users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE The Protein Ontology (PRO) will allow researchers to capture and accurately represent scientific knowledge of proteins thus providing a research infrastructure for modeling biological systems and for protein-centric integration of existing and emerging experimental and clinical data. As a component of the global informatics resource network, the PRO resource will be instrumental in computational analysis and knowledge discovery of genome-scale data and will aid in improving our understanding of human disease, and in the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,9331689,R01GM080646,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Literature', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinical application', 'computational reasoning', 'data integration', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'protein complex', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'usability', 'web portal', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2017,708354,0.00748735681144035
"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).         ",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9076888,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,240650,0.04514016012222056
"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,9127807,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mullerian duct inhibiting substance', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'community based participatory research', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'lexical', 'programs', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,362613,0.004661089608729988
"Bio Text NLP ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Since our last renewal, the challenges for biomedical researchers of keeping up with the scientific literature have become even more acute. Last year marked the first time that Medline indexed more than a million journal articles; more than 210,000 of these had full text deposited in PubMedCentral, bringing the total number of full texts archived in PMC to over 3 million. The stunning pleiotropy of genes and their products, combined with the adoption of genome-scale technologies throughout biomedical research, has made obsolete the notion that reading within one's own specialty plus a few ""top"" journals is enough to keep track of all of the results relevan to one's research. Fortunately, advances in biomedical natural language processing and increasing access to digital full text journal publications offer the potential for innovative new approaches to delivering relevant information to working bench scientists.         We hypothesize that realizing the potential of biomedical natural language processing applied to full text journal articles to make a sustained and powerful contribution to biomedical research requires contextualizing Biomedical natural language processing in the daily life of bench scientists, focusing on their unmet information gathering needs, and providing interfaces that fit well into existing research workflows.

"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. To assess the state of the art in biomedical entity recognition and relation extraction, we organized a science competition at BioCreative V, an international challenge event for evaluating advances in text mining research for biology. Specifically, we designed two challenge tasks: disease named entity recognition (DNER) and chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction. To assist system development and assessment, we created a large annotated text corpus that consisted of human annotations of chemicals, diseases and their interactions from 1500 PubMed articles. 34 teams worldwide participated in the CDR task: 16 (DNER) and 18 (CID). The best systems achieved an F-score of 86.46% for the DNER task--a result that approaches the human inter-annotator agreement (0.8875)--and an F-score of 57.03% for the CID task, the highest results ever reported for such tasks. Given the level of participation and team results, we found our task to be successful in engaging the text-mining research community, producing a large annotated corpus and improving the results of automatic disease recognition and CDR extraction.  In addition to organizing the BioCreative task, we continued our own development of biomedical named entity taggers in 2015-2016. First and foremost, we created a general toolkit called TaggerOne: the first machine learning model for joint named entity recognition and normalization. TaggerOne is an all-purpose tagger (i.e. not specific to any entity type), requiring only annotated training data and a corresponding lexicon, and has been optimized for high throughput. We validated TaggerOne with multiple gold-standard corpora containing both mention- and concept-level annotations. Its results compare favorably to the previous state of the art, notwithstanding the greater flexibility of the model. TaggerOne is implemented in Java and its source code has been made publicly available to the research community.   However, large-scale use of open-source tools sometimes requires a significant investment in infrastructure and maintenance time. These investments not only impair the continued adoption of text mining tools, but also reduce the ability of individual researchers to explore applying text mining to problems in their research area. In contrast, Web services provide on-demand access to software tools through the Internet using straightforward interfaces and data formats. Providing text mining tools as web services therefore reduces the bar to use for biocurators and bioinformatics researchers not working specifically in text mining, allowing free exploration and the ability to focus on results rather than methodology.  Therefore, in 2015 we developed NCBI text-mining web services, an online version of our text mining tool suite for biomedical concept recognition and information extraction. Our service incorporates multiple state of the art tools for identifying critical entity types: DNorm (for diseases), GNormPlus (genes and proteins), SR4GN (species), tmChem (chemicals and drugs), and tmVar (variants). Our web service has already processed over 60 million requests since its inception from researchers in 46 countries, supporting research projects in biocuration, crowdsourcing and translational bioinformatics. We anticipate that providing text mining tools as web services will greatly expand their utility to the biomedical research community.  Finally, as mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we continued to improve our previous curation-assisting tool  PubTator  and to collaborate with domain experts: human database curators in this case. With these efforts, our PubTator system is continuously being used in the production curation pipeline of two external databases on a daily basis:  1.

"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance.

"In silico identification of phyto-therapies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plants have been acknowledged as forming the basis of medicines dating back to the most ancient civilizations. To complement synthetic drug discovery processes, there remains a significant opportunity for identifying potential new therapies from plant-based sources (""phyto-therapies""). Current approaches used for the discovery of potential phyto-therapies are laborious, time-consuming, and mostly manual. The increased availability of ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge in digital formats suggests that there may be the potential to leverage automated techniques to facilitate the phyto-therapy discovery process. The long-term goal of this initiative is thus to develop a semantically integrated framework that could be used to identify and validate potential phyto-therapies embedded within ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge sources, and thus encourage the conservation of this knowledge and biodiversity. The overall project is built around three major aims, which are to: (1) develop a standards-driven gold standard that can be used for benchmarking automated phyto-therapy identification approaches; (2) develop an automated approach to identify potential phyto-therapies from digitized biodiversity literature (Biodiversity Heritage Library), biomedical literature citations (MEDLINE) or digital full-text (PubMed Central), genomic (GenBank), clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov), and chemical (PubChem) resources; and (3) leverage vector space modeling techniques to predict the relevance of potential phyto-therapies. The success of this endeavor will set the stage for the translation of a growing, but currently disjointed, evidence-base of medicinal plant knowledge into tools for the elucidation of potential phyto-therapies. Furthermore, through achieving these aims, this project will also establish a first-of- its-kind in silico platform that could be extended to identify additional therapeutics from a broad spectrum of biodiversity sources. The core aspects of this project will build on experience with developing computational techniques to bridge biodiversity and biomedical knowledge, including those that have been pioneered by the research team.      This project will bring together biomedical informatics, library science, and ethnobotany experience and expertise from two institutions: the University of Vermont and The New York Botanical Garden. The multi- institutional and multi-PI aspects of this project support the feasibility of the proposed project aims and will furthermore enable the load-balancing of essential tasks such that they may meet the proposed milestones set for each aim. To this end, the success of the proposed endeavor will be built on a foundation of experiences in gathering ethnobotanical knowledge, analyzing and linking biodiversity and biomedical knowledge sources, and developing approaches for systematically annotating corpora for subsequent purposes in support of natural language processing and data mining pursuits. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  The identification of potential therapies is a significant area of research with direct public health implications. As such, the integration of knowledge from traditionally disjoint knowledge sources may offer a more holistic view of the ethnobotanical and biomedical research knowledge that can support the development of new disease treatment regimens.",In silico identification of phyto-therapies,9123422,R01LM011963,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automated Annotation', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Biodiversity', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Botanicals', 'Chemicals', 'Civilization', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnobotany', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Island', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Library Science', 'Link', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Manuals', 'Medicinal Plants', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Products', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'PubChem', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Samoan', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Vermont', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical application', 'computer infrastructure', 'data mining', 'digital', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'indexing', 'literature citation', 'meetings', 'novel therapeutics', 'prostratin', 'success', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,419732,0.05934937606743623
"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web. These combined efforts will accelerate basic understanding of disease processes and discovery of diagnostic targets and more effective individualized therapies.",Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery,9195864,U01GM120953,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'cell type', 'collaborative environment', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'enzyme substrate', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'hackathon', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'system architecture', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,U01,2016,374400,0.04298074208531548
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. We will build upon the previous work of our ongoing project ""Temporal relation discovery for clinical text"" (R01LM010090) dubbed Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org) which has been focusing on methodology for event, temporal expressions and temporal relations discovery from the clinical text residing in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR). Through our participation in organizing major international bakeoffs - CLEF/ShARe 2014, SemEval 2014 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 7, SemEval 2015 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 14, SemEval 2015 Clinical TempEval Task 6 - we further disseminated the THYME resources and challenged the international research community to explore new solutions to the unsolved temporality task. Through all these activities it became clear that computational approaches to temporality still present great challenges and usability of the output is still limited. Therefore, we propose to further innovate on methodologies and end user experience.             Specific Aim 1: Extract enhanced representations and novel features to support deriving timeline information.     Specific Aim 2: Develop methods to amalgamate individual patient episode timelines into an aggregate patient-level timeline.     Specific Aim 3: Mine the EHR - the unstructured clinical text and the structured codified information - for full patient-level temporality.     Specific Aim 4: Develop a comprehensive temporal visualization tool     Specific Aim 5: Develop methodology for and perform extrinsic evaluation on specific use case.     Specific Aim 6: (1) Evaluate state-of-the-art of temporal relations through organizing international challenges under the auspices of SemEval, (2) Disseminate the results through publications, presentations, and open source code in Apache cTAKES. Functional testing. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EHR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,9146765,R01LM010090,"['Apache', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biology', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Language', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'clinically relevant', 'data mining', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'symptom treatment', 'syntax', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,643863,0.012791532120584844
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Collaborative Prot�g� supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics to build ontologies to solve problems in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision support. The proposed research will develop data-driven methods to identify patterns in design, development, and use of ontologies, and will apply these methods to help us to build new technology that both facilitates the ontology-development process and makes ontology design more principled.",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8997510,R01GM086587,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Parasites', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'Traditional Medicine', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical resource', 'biomedical scientist', 'craniofacial development', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,510376,0.1276974154283038
"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Protégé to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Protégé generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.  Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,8985684,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Indium', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'coping', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2016,405708,0.05149949111273752
"PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Biomedical ontologies are critical to the accurate representation and integration of genome-scale data in biomedical and clinical research. The Protein Ontology (PRO)-the reference ontology for protein entities in the OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry-represents protein families, multiple protein forms (proteoforms) arising from single genes, and protein complexes. This competitive renewal grant application will further establish PRO as a scalable, flexible, collaborative research infrastructure for protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data of increasing volume and complexity. Specific aims are to: (i) enable scalable and dynamic representation of protein types; (ii) provide comprehensive coverage of human proteoforms in their biological context; (iii) develop collaborative use cases and support an expanding community of users to advance protein-disease understanding; and (iv) broaden dissemination to support semantic computing, dynamic term mapping, and interoperability and reusability. We will increase PRO coverage by semi-automated import of proteoforms and complexes from curated databases and via established text mining approaches. Expert curation will focus on human variant forms, post-translational modification (PTM) forms and complexes critical to disease processes, along with homologous mouse forms. We will develop a new PRO sub-ontology of protein sites-amino acid positions of significance-to enable automatic and dynamic definition of combinatoric proteoforms. We will establish PRO OWL and RDF versions and provide a SPARQL query endpoint to support semantic computing. We will organize annual workshops and annotation jamborees to develop use cases and promote PRO co-development with community collaborators to address specific disciplinary needs. PRO has several unique features. For knowledge representation, PRO defines precise protein entities to support accurate annotation at the appropriate level of granularity and provides the ontological framework to connect PTM and variant proteoforms and complexes necessary to model human health and disease. For semantic data integration, PRO provides the ontological structure to connect-via specified relations-the vast amounts of proteomics data and biomedical knowledge to support hypothesis generation and testing. PRO therefore addresses the gaps in the bioinformatics infrastructure for protein representations in a way that makes knowledge about proteins more accessible to computational reasoning, fully complementing existing knowledge sources. The proposed research will allow the PRO Consortium to deepen and broaden PRO for scalable semantic integration of biomedical data, facilitating protein-disease knowledge discovery and clinical applications by an expanding community of biomedical, clinical and computational users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE The Protein Ontology (PRO) will allow researchers to capture and accurately represent scientific knowledge of proteins thus providing a research infrastructure for modeling biological systems and for protein-centric integration of existing and emerging experimental and clinical data. As a component of the global informatics resource network, the PRO resource will be instrumental in computational analysis and knowledge discovery of genome-scale data and will aid in improving our understanding of human disease, and in the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,9303592,R01GM080646,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinical application', 'computational reasoning', 'data integration', 'disease classification', 'disease phenotype', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'protein complex', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'usability', 'web portal', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2016,20000,0.00748735681144035

We will establish PRO OWL and RDF versions and provide a SPARQL query endpoint to support semantic computing. We will organize annual workshops and annotation jamborees to develop use cases and promote PRO co-development with community collaborators to address specific disciplinary needs. PRO has several unique features. For knowledge representation, PRO defines precise protein entities to support accurate annotation at the appropriate level of granularity and provides the ontological framework to connect PTM and variant proteoforms and complexes necessary to model human health and disease. For semantic data integration, PRO provides the ontological structure to connect-via specified relations-the vast amounts of proteomics data and biomedical knowledge to support hypothesis generation and testing. PRO therefore addresses the gaps in the bioinformatics infrastructure for protein representations in a way that makes knowledge about proteins more accessible to computational reasoning, fully complementing existing knowledge sources. The proposed research will allow the PRO Consortium to deepen and broaden PRO for scalable semantic integration of biomedical data, facilitating protein-disease knowledge discovery and clinical applications by an expanding community of biomedical, clinical and computational users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE The Protein Ontology (PRO) will allow researchers to capture and accurately represent scientific knowledge of proteins thus providing a research infrastructure for modeling biological systems and for protein-centric integration of existing and emerging experimental and clinical data. As a component of the global informatics resource network, the PRO resource will be instrumental in computational analysis and knowledge discovery of genome-scale data and will aid in improving our understanding of human disease, and in the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,9120920,R01GM080646,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinical application', 'computational reasoning', 'data integration', 'disease classification', 'disease phenotype', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'protein complex', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'usability', 'web portal', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2016,688354,0.00748735681144035
"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8840267,R01GM095476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical information system', 'biomedical scientist', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2015,490160,0.10948453803188694
"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty            ",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,8884888,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mullerian duct inhibiting substance', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'lexical', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,376917,0.004661089608729988
"Bio Text NLP ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Since our last renewal, the challenges for biomedical researchers of keeping up with the scientific literature have become even more acute. Last year marked the first time that Medline indexed more than a million journal articles; more than 210,000 of these had full text deposited in PubMedCentral, bringing the total number of full texts archived in PMC to over 3 million. The stunning pleiotropy of genes and their products, combined with the adoption of genome-scale technologies throughout biomedical research, has made obsolete the notion that reading within one's own specialty plus a few ""top"" journals is enough to keep track of all of the results relevan to one's research. Fortunately, advances in biomedical natural language processing and increasing access to digital full text journal publications offer the potential for innovative new approaches to delivering relevant information to working bench scientists.         We hypothesize that realizing the potential of biomedical natural language processing applied to full text journal articles to make a sustained and powerful contribution to biomedical research requires contextualizing Biomedical natural language processing in the daily life of bench scientists, focusing on their unmet information gathering needs, and providing interfaces that fit well into existing research workflows.             Project Narrative This project will affect public health by increasing the ability of biologists to investigate hypotheses using the biomedical literature.

"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. Our recent research introduced a state-of-the-art system called DNorm for disease normalization based on pairwise learning to rank. In 2013-2014, we performed an investigation with regard to the different performance of DNorm when applied to clinical narratives vs. biomedical publications. We used closure properties to compare the richness of the vocabulary in clinical narrative text to biomedical publications. We found that while the size of the overall vocabulary is similar between clinical narrative and biomedical publications, clinical narrative uses a richer terminology to describe disorders than publications, which we believe to be one of the primary causes of reduced performance in clinical narrative. Accordingly, we introduced several lexical enhancements  generalizable to other clinical NLP tasks  that improved the ability of DNorm to handle this variation. The clinical version of DNorm (DNorm-C) is now made openly available to the research community, along with our other open source tools.  One common challenge in biomedical named entity recognition (NER) and normalization is the identification and resolution of composite named entities, where a single span refers to more than one concept (e.g., BRCA1/2). Previous NER and normalization studies have either ignored composite mentions, used simple ad hoc rules, or only handled coordination ellipsis, making a robust approach for handling multitype composite mentions greatly needed. In 2014-2015, we proposed a hybrid method integrating a machine-learning model with a pattern identification strategy to identify the individual components of each composite mention. Our method, which we have named SimConcept, is the first to systematically handle many types of composite mentions. The technique achieves high performance in identifying and resolving composite mentions for three key biological entities: genes (90.42% in F-measure), diseases (86.47% in F-measure), and chemicals (86.05% in F-measure). Furthermore, our results show that using our SimConcept method can subsequently improve the performance of gene and disease concept recognition and normalization.  As mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we continued to improve our previous curation-assisting tool  PubTator  and to collaborate with domain experts: human database curators in this case. With these efforts, our PubTator system is now being used in the production curation pipeline of two external databases on a daily basis:  1. HuGE Navigator: a CDC knowledgebase of human genome epidemiology  2. SwissProt: an annotated database of protein sequence and functional information.   In 2014-2015, we also investigated the feasibility of using crowdsourcing for respectively assisting gene-mutation curation and drug-indication cataloging, given the high cost of expert annotation. In both studies, we first translated the complex expert-annotation task into human intelligence tasks (HITs) suitable for the average workers. For instance, instead of asking people to find drug indications from free text (e.g. lengthy paragraphs), we simplified the task such that each HIT only involved a worker making a binary judgment of whether a highlighted disease, in context of a given drug label sentence, is an indication. Then we recruited annotators from an unknown network of workers through the technical environment of Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Judgments from the crowds were then aggregated to become the final answer. For evaluation, we assessed the ability of our proposed method to achieve high-quality annotations in a time-efficient and cost-effective manner. In comparison with the expert annotations, we find that our crowdsourcing approach not only results in significant cost and time saving, but also leads to accuracy comparable to that of domain experts. Therefore, we conclude that our crowdsourcing-based approach provides a readily scalable and cost-effective model to manual curation. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,9160930,ZIALM091813,"['Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Area', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2015,409028,0.048542407985310544
"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.

"In silico identification of phyto-therapies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plants have been acknowledged as forming the basis of medicines dating back to the most ancient civilizations. To complement synthetic drug discovery processes, there remains a significant opportunity for identifying potential new therapies from plant-based sources (""phyto-therapies""). Current approaches used for the discovery of potential phyto-therapies are laborious, time-consuming, and mostly manual. The increased availability of ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge in digital formats suggests that there may be the potential to leverage automated techniques to facilitate the phyto-therapy discovery process. The long-term goal of this initiative is thus to develop a semantically integrated framework that could be used to identify and validate potential phyto-therapies embedded within ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge sources, and thus encourage the conservation of this knowledge and biodiversity. The overall project is built around three major aims, which are to: (1) develop a standards-driven gold standard that can be used for benchmarking automated phyto-therapy identification approaches; (2) develop an automated approach to identify potential phyto-therapies from digitized biodiversity literature (Biodiversity Heritage Library), biomedical literature citations (MEDLINE) or digital full-text (PubMed Central), genomic (GenBank), clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov), and chemical (PubChem) resources; and (3) leverage vector space modeling techniques to predict the relevance of potential phyto-therapies. The success of this endeavor will set the stage for the translation of a growing, but currently disjointed, evidence-base of medicinal plant knowledge into tools for the elucidation of potential phyto-therapies. Furthermore, through achieving these aims, this project will also establish a first-of- its-kind in silico platform that could be extended to identify additional therapeutics from a broad spectrum of biodiversity sources. The core aspects of this project will build on experience with developing computational techniques to bridge biodiversity and biomedical knowledge, including those that have been pioneered by the research team.      This project will bring together biomedical informatics, library science, and ethnobotany experience and expertise from two institutions: the University of Vermont and The New York Botanical Garden. The multi- institutional and multi-PI aspects of this project support the feasibility of the proposed project aims and will furthermore enable the load-balancing of essential tasks such that they may meet the proposed milestones set for each aim. To this end, the success of the proposed endeavor will be built on a foundation of experiences in gathering ethnobotanical knowledge, analyzing and linking biodiversity and biomedical knowledge sources, and developing approaches for systematically annotating corpora for subsequent purposes in support of natural language processing and data mining pursuits.

"Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research plan: The use of clinical knowledge systems such as UpToDate that provide reliable information at the point of care has been shown to improve patient safety and decision-making. With similar content to UpToDate, Mayo Clinic's AskMayoExpert (AME) is an online knowledge system that primarily contains over 5000 (and increasing) specialist-vetted answers to FAQs for point of care use. However, because of the overabundance of clinical resources and guidelines, adding new answers manually to AME and ensuring that it is consistent with evidence is time consuming. This problem is also faced with other systems such as UpToDate. This career grant proposes to investigate the feasibility of using a novel text mining based informatics approach to semi-automate the management of a clinical knowledge system, using AME as the test bed. Although the methods will be applicable to any clinical knowledge system and any topic, they will be evaluated using two important test topics from cardiology (which has the biggest focus in AME) - atrial fibrillation (a topic exhaustively covered in AME) and congestive heart failure (a topic less covered, but is an increasingly complex vast field with knowledge from huge literature). While the existing content of AME is private, the methods and the code we develop to assist in generating the content will be released open-source as part of the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) consortium in UIMA framework. Career plan: As most communication of information in clinical practice and biomedical research occurs through the medium of text, the development of methods to render this text computer-interpretable is a prerequisite to the use of this information to improve quality of care and support scientific discovery. The PI's long-term career goal is to become a leader in biomedical informatics (informatics applied to biomedical data), with focus on textual data such as scientific papers and clinical notes. He has BS in Computer Science, PhD in Biomedical Informatics and over a dozen of peer-reviewed publications in biomedical text mining. His career goal is to advance diverse methods and applications of text mining across biomedical informatics (BMI). He will focus on: a) discovering information needs and gaps that can be filled, b) adapting and extending existing text mining algorithms, and c) validating the utility of the applications in the biomedical environment. Rationale: Making the transition from a mentored researcher to an independent researcher requires three main facets of career growth: a) developing a working familiarity with clinical information systems and medical terminologies; b) understanding the information needs of clinicians; and c) training in clinical research. The proposal will translate the PI's knowledgeof the text mining methods to practical experience in an operation clinical environment. Courses listed in the ""Career Development/Training Activities"" will educate him more about the environment and train him on clinical research. He will continue sharpening his informatics expertise by attending scientific conferences. Project Narrative Medical errors are one of the leading causes of death in the United States.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. We will build upon the previous work of our ongoing project ""Temporal relation discovery for clinical text"" (R01LM010090) dubbed Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org) which has been focusing on methodology for event, temporal expressions and temporal relations discovery from the clinical text residing in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR). Through our participation in organizing major international bakeoffs - CLEF/ShARe 2014, SemEval 2014 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 7, SemEval 2015 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 14, SemEval 2015 Clinical TempEval Task 6 - we further disseminated the THYME resources and challenged the international research community to explore new solutions to the unsolved temporality task. Through all these activities it became clear that computational approaches to temporality still present great challenges and usability of the output is still limited. Therefore, we propose to further innovate on methodologies and end user experience.             Specific Aim 1: Extract enhanced representations and novel features to support deriving timeline information.     Specific Aim 2: Develop methods to amalgamate individual patient episode timelines into an aggregate patient-level timeline.     Specific Aim 3: Mine the EHR - the unstructured clinical text and the structured codified information - for full patient-level temporality.     Specific Aim 4: Develop a comprehensive temporal visualization tool     Specific Aim 5: Develop methodology for and perform extrinsic evaluation on specific use case.     Specific Aim 6: (1) Evaluate state-of-the-art of temporal relations through organizing international challenges under the auspices of SemEval, (2) Disseminate the results through publications, presentations, and open source code in Apache cTAKES. Functional testing.             Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EHR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,8927274,R01LM010090,"['Apache Indians', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biology', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Language', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'clinically relevant', 'data mining', 'experience', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'syntax', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,720481,0.012791532120584844
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Collaborative Prot�g� supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics to build ontologies to solve problems in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision support. The proposed research will develop data-driven methods to identify patterns in design, development, and use of ontologies, and will apply these methods to help us to build new technology that both facilitates the ontology-development process and makes ontology design more principled.",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8803385,R01GM086587,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Parasites', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'Traditional Medicine', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical resource', 'biomedical scientist', 'craniofacial development', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,523965,0.1276974154283038
"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Protégé to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Protégé generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.  Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.            ",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,8817212,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Indium', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'coping', 'digital', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2015,406247,0.05149949111273752
"PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY Biomedical ontologies are critical to the accurate representation and integration of genome-scale data in biomedical and clinical research. The Protein Ontology (PRO)-the reference ontology for protein entities in the OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry-represents protein families, multiple protein forms (proteoforms) arising from single genes, and protein complexes. This competitive renewal grant application will further establish PRO as a scalable, flexible, collaborative research infrastructure for protein-centric semantic integration of biomedical data of increasing volume and complexity. Specific aims are to: (i) enable scalable and dynamic representation of protein types; (ii) provide comprehensive coverage of human proteoforms in their biological context; (iii) develop collaborative use cases and support an expanding community of users to advance protein-disease understanding; and (iv) broaden dissemination to support semantic computing, dynamic term mapping, and interoperability and reusability. We will increase PRO coverage by semi-automated import of proteoforms and complexes from curated databases and via established text mining approaches. Expert curation will focus on human variant forms, post-translational modification (PTM) forms and complexes critical to disease processes, along with homologous mouse forms. We will develop a new PRO sub-ontology of protein sites-amino acid positions of significance-to enable automatic and dynamic definition of combinatoric proteoforms. We will establish PRO OWL and RDF versions and provide a SPARQL query endpoint to support semantic computing. We will organize annual workshops and annotation jamborees to develop use cases and promote PRO co-development with community collaborators to address specific disciplinary needs. PRO has several unique features. For knowledge representation, PRO defines precise protein entities to support accurate annotation at the appropriate level of granularity and provides the ontological framework to connect PTM and variant proteoforms and complexes necessary to model human health and disease. For semantic data integration, PRO provides the ontological structure to connect-via specified relations-the vast amounts of proteomics data and biomedical knowledge to support hypothesis generation and testing. PRO therefore addresses the gaps in the bioinformatics infrastructure for protein representations in a way that makes knowledge about proteins more accessible to computational reasoning, fully complementing existing knowledge sources. The proposed research will allow the PRO Consortium to deepen and broaden PRO for scalable semantic integration of biomedical data, facilitating protein-disease knowledge discovery and clinical applications by an expanding community of biomedical, clinical and computational users.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE The Protein Ontology (PRO) will allow researchers to capture and accurately represent scientific knowledge of proteins thus providing a research infrastructure for modeling biological systems and for protein-centric integration of existing and emerging experimental and clinical data. As a component of the global informatics resource network, the PRO resource will be instrumental in computational analysis and knowledge discovery of genome-scale data and will aid in improving our understanding of human disease, and in the identification of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.            ",PRO: A Protein Ontology in OBO Foundry for Scalable Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,8964875,R01GM080646,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinical application', 'data integration', 'disease classification', 'disease phenotype', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'protein complex', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'usability', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2015,745136,0.00748735681144035
"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8734439,R01GM095476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor-Rearrangement Excision DNA Circles', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical information system', 'biomedical scientist', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2014,489755,0.10948453803188694
"Free Text Gene Name Recognition 1) I have been a co-organizer of the BioCreative Workshops since 2005 and have taken part in BioCreative II (2007), BioCreative III (2010), BioCreative-2012 Workshop (2012), and BioCreative IV (2013). The overall goal of the BioCreative Workshops is to promote the development of text mining and text processing tools which are useful to the communities of researchers and database curators in the biological sciences. We recently helped organize the BioCreative-2012 Workshop associated with the Biocuration 2012 Conference and also participated in Task I which involved producing a triage system for the CTD database. Our approach was based on the approach used for the GN task of BioCreative III, but we took a different approach to identify genes, proteins, and diseases based on a semantic classifier and we also added features based on an LDA analysis of the CTD database. Our approach was effective in obtaining the best triage results on the task. 2) We recently co-chaired the BioCreative III Workshop in which the main competitive tasks were to find gene mentions in a full text article and map them to their GenBank identifiers and score them as to reliability, to classify PubMed records as likely to represent articles containing information on protein-protein interactions, and to find the text in full papers that describes the method used by an experimenter to experimentally verify a protein-protein interaction. We organized the first of these tasks. Our contribution on the first task included selecting documents to annotate, overseeing the annotation process, evaluating participants submissions, and writing up a full description of the task and presenting results at the conference. We also entered the triage task for detecting papers suitable for curation of protein-protein interactions. For this task we used the priority model to identify gene/protein names and used parsing to prepare dependency relations between proteins and other text elements and these relationships as well as text words were used as features. Machine learning was then applied to this representation and we turned in the best performance on the task. 3) We are currently working to develop more general methods of finding high value articles for PPI based on their abstracts. This effort involves not only more powerful ranking methods, but also ways to display evidence to the user for a users quick evaluation. 4) We are also investigating an approach to named entity recognition for a large number of biologically important entity types. 5) We have begun a project called BioC which is an effort to create a general XML format defined by a DTD and software to read and write this format. Currently this approach has been implemented in C++, Java, Python, Pearl, Ruby, and GO. The idea is to use this common currency to make software modules that are  useful for natural language processing  more interoperable. The project is in its early stages, but already we have software to read and write in the languages mentioned as well as significant NLP processing modules using this approach and over 25 gold standard NLP annotated data sets available in the format. The approach was featured in the BioCreative IV Workshop and a proposal to feature it again in the upcoming BioCreative V Workshop has been developed. n/a",Free Text Gene Name Recognition,8943225,ZIALM000093,"['Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Genbank', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Java', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Triage', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'improved', 'protein protein interaction', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2014,311963,-0.01413756436152045
"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. Our recent research introduced a machine learning method called DNorm for normalization based on pairwise learning to rank. In 2013-2014, we have continued our efforts in improving DNorm by increasing its scalability through a dimension reduction technique based on low-rank matrix approximation. When assessed on our recently developed NCBI disease corpus, the new algorithm demonstrates a significant reduction in the number of parameters to be learned while maintaining a high accuracy.   Besides disease named entity recognition (NER), we also improved the state of the art in the chemical NER problem. Through participation of the BioCreative IV CHEMDNER task, we introduced the tmChem system, a chemical named entity recognizer created by combining two independent machine-learning models in an ensemble. We used the challenge task corpus to develop and evaluate tmChem, achieving a micro-averaged f-measure of 0.8739 on the mention-level evaluation, which is the highest performance among all participating teams.   To improve the interoperability among various biomedical text-mining tools our group has created over the years (e.g. DNorm, tmChem, tmVar, etc), we recently adopted a newly proposed community-wide scheme called BioC for handling heterogeneity and variety in data formats. Specifically, we modified our tools and enabled them to read/write data in the proposed BioC format. The resulting BioC wrapped toolkit, is named as tmBioC. Through empirical studies, we demonstrated that our tools in tmBioC can be more efficiently integrated with each other as well as with external tools: Our experimental results show that using BioC reduces >60% in lines of code for text-mining tool integration.   As mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we focused on Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, which is a common task among model organism database (MOD) groups. It is also a very time-consuming and labor-intensive task, thus often considered as one of the bottlenecks in literature curation. There is a growing need for semi- or fully-automated GO curation techniques that will help database curators rapidly and accurately identify gene function information in full-length articles. Despite multiple attempts in the past, few studies have proven to be useful with regard to assisting real-world GO curation. The lack of sentence-level training data and opportunities for interaction between text mining developers and GO curators has limited the advances in algorithm development and corresponding use in practical circumstances. To this end, we organized a text-mining challenge task for literature-based GO annotation in BioCreative IV. More specifically, we developed two sub-tasks: a) to automatically locate text passages that contain GO-relevant information (a text retrieval task) and b) to automatically identify relevant GO terms for the genes in a given article (a concept recognition task). With the support from five MODs, we provided teams with nearly 4,000 unique text passages that served as the basis for each GO annotation in our task data. Such evidence text information has long been recognized as critical for text-mining algorithm development but was never made available due to the high cost of curation. In total, seven teams participated in the challenge task. From the team results, we find an overall improvement in performance for recognizing GO terms when comparing to similar task results in the past. Future work should focus on improving performance of GO concept recognition and incorporating practical benefits of text-mining tools into real-world GO annotation. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,8943240,ZIALM091813,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cost', 'data format', 'gene function', 'improved', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'model organisms databases', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2014,831900,0.054281482789415185
"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.              Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Hunter, Lawrence E.

"In silico identification of phyto-therapies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plants have been acknowledged as forming the basis of medicines dating back to the most ancient civilizations. To complement synthetic drug discovery processes, there remains a significant opportunity for identifying potential new therapies from plant-based sources (""phyto-therapies""). Current approaches used for the discovery of potential phyto-therapies are laborious, time-consuming, and mostly manual. The increased availability of ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge in digital formats suggests that there may be the potential to leverage automated techniques to facilitate the phyto-therapy discovery process. The long-term goal of this initiative is thus to develop a semantically integrated framework that could be used to identify and validate potential phyto-therapies embedded within ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge sources, and thus encourage the conservation of this knowledge and biodiversity. The overall project is built around three major aims, which are to: (1) develop a standards-driven gold standard that can be used for benchmarking automated phyto-therapy identification approaches; (2) develop an automated approach to identify potential phyto-therapies from digitized biodiversity literature (Biodiversity Heritage Library), biomedical literature citations (MEDLINE) or digital full-text (PubMed Central), genomic (GenBank), clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov), and chemical (PubChem) resources; and (3) leverage vector space modeling techniques to predict the relevance of potential phyto-therapies. The success of this endeavor will set the stage for the translation of a growing, but currently disjointed, evidence-base of medicinal plant knowledge into tools for the elucidation of potential phyto-therapies. Furthermore, through achieving these aims, this project will also establish a first-of- its-kind in silico platform that could be extended to identify additional therapeutics from a broad spectrum of biodiversity sources. The core aspects of this project will build on experience with developing computational techniques to bridge biodiversity and biomedical knowledge, including those that have been pioneered by the research team.      This project will bring together biomedical informatics, library science, and ethnobotany experience and expertise from two institutions: the University of Vermont and The New York Botanical Garden. The multi- institutional and multi-PI aspects of this project support the feasibility of the proposed project aims and will furthermore enable the load-balancing of essential tasks such that they may meet the proposed milestones set for each aim. To this end, the success of the proposed endeavor will be built on a foundation of experiences in gathering ethnobotanical knowledge, analyzing and linking biodiversity and biomedical knowledge sources, and developing approaches for systematically annotating corpora for subsequent purposes in support of natural language processing and data mining pursuits.                RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  The identification of potential therapies is a significant area of research with direct public health implications. As such, the integration of knowledge from traditionally disjoint knowledge sources may offer a more holistic view of the ethnobotanical and biomedical research knowledge that can support the development of new disease treatment regimens.

"Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research plan: The use of clinical knowledge systems such as UpToDate that provide reliable information at the point of care has been shown to improve patient safety and decision-making. With similar content to UpToDate, Mayo Clinic's AskMayoExpert (AME) is an online knowledge system that primarily contains over 5000 (and increasing) specialist-vetted answers to FAQs for point of care use. However, because of the overabundance of clinical resources and guidelines, adding new answers manually to AME and ensuring that it is consistent with evidence is time consuming. This problem is also faced with other systems such as UpToDate. This career grant proposes to investigate the feasibility of using a novel text mining based informatics approach to semi-automate the management of a clinical knowledge system, using AME as the test bed. Although the methods will be applicable to any clinical knowledge system and any topic, they will be evaluated using two important test topics from cardiology (which has the biggest focus in AME) - atrial fibrillation (a topic exhaustively covered in AME) and congestive heart failure (a topic less covered, but is an increasingly complex vast field with knowledge from huge literature). While the existing content of AME is private, the methods and the code we develop to assist in generating the content will be released open-source as part of the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) consortium in UIMA framework. Career plan: As most communication of information in clinical practice and biomedical research occurs through the medium of text, the development of methods to render this text computer-interpretable is a prerequisite to the use of this information to improve quality of care and support scientific discovery. The PI's long-term career goal is to become a leader in biomedical informatics (informatics applied to biomedical data), with focus on textual data such as scientific papers and clinical notes. He has BS in Computer Science, PhD in Biomedical Informatics and over a dozen of peer-reviewed publications in biomedical text mining. His career goal is to advance diverse methods and applications of text mining across biomedical informatics (BMI). He will focus on: a) discovering information needs and gaps that can be filled, b) adapting and extending existing text mining algorithms, and c) validating the utility of the applications in the biomedical environment. Rationale: Making the transition from a mentored researcher to an independent researcher requires three main facets of career growth: a) developing a working familiarity with clinical information systems and medical terminologies; b) understanding the information needs of clinicians; and c) training in clinical research. The proposal will translate the PI's knowledgeof the text mining methods to practical experience in an operation clinical environment. Courses listed in the ""Career Development/Training Activities"" will educate him more about the environment and train him on clinical research. He will continue sharpening his informatics expertise by attending scientific conferences.             Project Narrative Medical errors are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. It has been observed that point of care access to relevant clinical knowledge support decision making and decreases medical errors, thereby improving patient safety and healthcare costs. The proposed research aims to empower physicians specialized in the area (specialists) in quickly gathering evidence from literature or finding citations supporting or qualifying their expert opinion.

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text.

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Collaborative Prot�g� supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics to build ontologies to solve problems in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision support. The proposed research will develop data-driven methods to identify patterns in design, development, and use of ontologies, and will apply these methods to help us to build new technology that both facilitates the ontology-development process and makes ontology design more principled.            ",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8628132,R01GM086587,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Parasites', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'Traditional Medicine', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical resource', 'biomedical scientist', 'craniofacial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'malformation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,525880,0.1276974154283038
"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Prot¿g¿ system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Prot¿g¿ users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Prot¿g¿ to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Prot¿g¿ generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Prot¿g¿ user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8474789,R01GM095476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor-Rearrangement Excision DNA Circles', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical information system', 'biomedical scientist', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2013,486484,0.10948453803188694
"Free Text Gene Name Recognition 1) I have been a co-organizer of the BioCreative Workshops since 2005 and have taken part in BioCreative II (2007), BioCreative III (2010), and the BioCreative-2012 Workshop (2012). The overall goal of the BioCreative Workshops is to promote the development of text mining and text processing tools which are useful to the communities of researchers and database curators in the biological sciences. We recently helped organize the BioCreative-2012 Workshop associated with the Biocuration 2012 Conference and also participated in Task I which involved producing a triage system for the CTD database. Our approach was based on the approach used for the GN task of BioCreative III, but we took a different approach to identify genes, proteins, and diseases based on a semantic classifier and we also added features based on an LDA analysis of the CTD database. Our approach was effective in obtaining the best triage results on the task. 2) We recently co-chaired the BioCreative III Workshop in which the main competitive tasks were to find gene mentions in a full text article and map them to their GenBank identifiers and score them as to reliability, to classify PubMed records as likely to represent articles containing information on protein-protein interactions, and to find the text in full papers that describes the method used by an experimenter to experimentally verify a protein-protein interaction. We organized the first of these tasks. Our contribution on the first task included selecting documents to annotate, overseeing the annotation process, evaluating participants submissions, and writing up a full description of the task and presenting results at the conference. We also entered the triage task for detecting papers suitable for curation of protein-protein interactions. For this task we used the priority model to identify gene/protein names and used parsing to prepare dependency relations between proteins and other text elements and these relationships as well as text words were used as features. Machine learning was then applied to this representation and we turned in the best performance on the task. 3) We are currently working to develop more general methods of finding high value articles for PPI based on their abstracts. This effort involves not only more powerful ranking methods, but also ways to display evidence to the user for a users quick evaluation. 4) We are also investigating an approach to named entity recognition for a large number of biologically important entity types. 5) We have begun a project called BioC which is an effort to create a general XML format defined by a DTD and software to read and write this format in C++, Java, Python, and possibly other languages. The idea is to use this common currency to make software modules that are  useful for natural language processing  more interoperable. The project is in its beginning stage, but already we have the DTD defined and the software to read and write in the languages mentioned as well as significant NLP processing modules using this approach. The approaches is being featured in the BioCreative IV Workshop. n/a",Free Text Gene Name Recognition,8746736,ZIALM000093,"['Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Genbank', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Java', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Triage', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'improved', 'protein protein interaction', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2013,369833,0.00033942717889851807

"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. Our own research in the past has mostly focused on identifying genes and species in PubMed citations. In 2012-2013, we have continued our efforts in improving disease name detection in free text. Despite the central role of diseases in biomedical research, there have been much fewer attempts to automatically determine which diseases are mentioned in a text - the task of disease name normalization - compared with other normalization tasks (e.g. gene normalization) in biomedical text mining research. To this end, we developed the first machine-learning approach for disease name normalization (DNorm), based on our previously developed NCBI Disease corpus. Our technique is based on pairwise learning to rank, which has not previously been applied to the normalization task but has proven successful in very large optimization problems for information retrieval. When comparing our method to traditional approaches based on lexical normalization and matching, DNorm achieved 0.782 micro-averaged F-measure and 0.809 macro-averaged F-measure, an increase over the highest performing baseline method of 0.121 and 0.098, respectively. Our DNorm system was also applied to the 2013 ShARe/CLEF eHealth Shared Task, a worldwide challenge task of recognizing disease names in 4 different types of clinical notes (e.g. discharge summary). We achieved the highest performance in the disease normalization task among all 16 international participating teams.   Besides disease name recognition, we also improved the state of the art in finding mutations in free text. Text-mining mutation information from the literature becomes a critical part of the bioinformatics approach for the analysis and interpretation of sequence variations in complex diseases in the post-genomic era. It has also been used for assisting the creation of disease-related mutation databases. Most of existing approaches are rule-based and focus on limited types of sequence variations, such as protein point mutations. Thus, extending their extraction scope requires significant manual efforts in examining new instances and developing corresponding rules. As such, new automatic approaches are greatly needed for extracting different kinds of mutations with high accuracy. Hence, we developed tmVar, a text-mining approach based on conditional random field (CRF) for extracting a wide range of sequence variants described at protein, DNA and RNA levels according to a standard nomenclature developed by the Human Genome Variation Society. By doing so, we cover several important types of mutations that were not considered in traditional methods. Using a novel CRF label model and feature set, tmVar achieves higher performance than a state-of-the-art method on both our corpus (91.4 versus 78.1% in F-measure) and their own gold standard (93.9 versus 89.4% in F-measure).   As mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we developed PubTator and assessed its use in assisting manual biocuration through participation in BioCreative 2012, an international workshop that brings together the text mining and biology communities to drive the development of text mining systems that can be integrated into the biocuration workflow and the knowledge discovery process.   Our PubTator system is a Web-based tool for assisting manual literature curation: a highly expensive endeavor of extracting knowledge from biomedical literature into structured databases. Our PubTator system is different from the few existing tools by featuring a PubMed-like interface, which many biocurators find familiar, and being equipped with multiple challenge-winning text mining algorithms to ensure the quality of its automatically computed results. Through a formal evaluation with two external user groups, PubTator was shown to be capable of improving both the efficiency and accuracy of manual curation. PubTator is currently being used in assisting real-life database curation. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,8746751,ZIALM091813,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Genome', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'database structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'lexical', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2013,821852,0.05437532926340591
"Phenotype Discovery in NHLBI Genomic Studies (PhD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Researchers continually upload data into public repositories at a rapid pace, yet utilize few common standards for annotation, making it close to impossible to compare or associate data across studies. To address this problem, we will develop a defined meta- data model and build an integrated system called Phenotype Discovery (PhD) that enables researchers to query and find genomic studies of interest in public repositories as well as upload new data into our database (sdGaP), in a standardized manner. A Query Interpreter (QI) will utilize text mining and natural language processing techniques to map free text into concepts in biomedical ontologies, allowing non-structured queries to be answered efficiently. In Phase I of the project, we will develop a proof-of-concept system that can retrospectively structure phenotypic descriptions in dbGaP, and will work with domain experts in pneumology to build use cases and evaluate the automated mappings. In Phase II of the project, we will extend the domain expertise to cardiology, hematology, and sleep disorders to build a more comprehensive system, expanding the phenotype annotation to transcriptome databases, and integrating a flexible automated genotype annotation tool for sdGaP. We will develop a user-friendly interface to prospectively assist researchers in uploading their data with standardized phenotypic annotations. We will provide the tool for free from our website and continuously improve its quality, based on user feedback and usage data.        Relevance Phenotype Discovery (PhD) represents a novel, automated system to describe the characteristics of patients whose genetic information is available in public data repositories, without compromising their privacy. This initiative is greatly needed so that more researchers can make use of data collected from projects funded by public agencies.

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text.

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.

"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Prot¿g¿ system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Prot¿g¿ users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Prot¿g¿ to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Prot¿g¿ generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Prot¿g¿ user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain. Component-level evaluation        Specific Aim 3: Integrate best method and/or a variety of methods for temporal relation discovery into the open source Mayo Clinic IE pipeline and release as open source annotators in the pipeline. Functional testing. Dissemination activities.        Specific Aim 4: System-level evaluation. Test the functionality of the enhanced Mayo Clinic IE pipeline on translational research use cases, e.g. the progression of colon cancer as documented in clinical notes and pathology reports, the progression of brain tumor as documented in radiology reports.        The methods we will use for the temporal relation discovery are based on machine learning, e.g., Support Vector Machine technology. Such methods require the annotation of a reference standard from which the computations are derived. The best methods will be released as part of the Mayo Clinic Information Extraction System for the larger community to use and contribute to. We will test the methods against biomedical queries.           Relevance (max 2-3 sentences) Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments.

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems.       This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries.

"Free Text Gene Name Recognition 1) I have been a co-organizer of the BioCreative Workshops since 2005 and have taken part in BioCreative II (2007), BioCreative III (2010), and the BioCreative-2012 Workshop (2012). The overall goal of the BioCreative Workshops is to promote the development of text mining and text processing tools which are useful to the communities of researchers and database curators in the biological sciences. Our contribution for BioCreative III was to organize the Gene Normalization (GN) task. This included selecting documents to annotate, overseeing the annotation process, evaluating participants submissions, and writing up a full description of the task and presenting results at the conference. We introduced two innovations in the task. First, we used the Tap-k measure developed by John Spouge and his group and we introduced an EM algorithm to estimate the correct answers based on all participant entries for the task. Tap-k is a performance measure which can best be characterized as a truncated mean average precision with a penalty term for retrieving useless records below the last useful hit. The EM algorithm allowed us to evaluate peoples predictions over a much larger set of full text documents than we could provide gold standard human judgments for (507). We also provided a set of 50 full text documents for which we had human annotations. When the results of the EM algorithm evaluation were compared with the gold standard results the ranks were quite close and allowed us to conclude that the automatic method of assessment was successful in singling out the top performing systems. We also entered the triage task for detecting papers suitable for curation of protein-protein interactions. For this task we used the priority model to identify gene/protein names and used parsing to prepare dependency relations between proteins and other text elements and these relationships as well as text words were used as features. Machine learning was then applied to this representation and we turned in the best performance on the task. We recently helped organize the BioCreative-2012 Workshop associated with the Biocuration 2012 Conference and also participated in Task I which involved producing a triage system for the CTD database. Our approach was based on the approach used for the GN task of BioCreative III, but we took a different approach to identify genes, proteins, and diseases based on a semantic classifier and we also added features based on an LDA analysis of the CTD database. Our approach was effective in obtaining the best triage results on the task. 2) We recently co-chaired the BioCreative III Workshop in which the main competitive tasks were to find gene mentions in a full text article and map them to their GenBank identifiers and score them as to reliability, to classify PubMed records as likely to represent articles containing information on protein-protein interactions, and to find the text in full papers that describes the method used by an experimenter to experimentally verify a protein-protein interaction. We organized the first of these task and participated in the second. In the second task we used the priority model to locate protein mentions and it proved very successful and competitive with other approaches. 3) We are currently working to develop more general methods of finding high value articles for PPI based on their abstracts. This effort involves not only more powerful ranking methods, but also ways to display evidence to the user for a users quick evaluation. n/a",Free Text Gene Name Recognition,8558107,ZIALM000093,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Genbank', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Judgment', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Triage', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'protein protein interaction', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2012,195229,0.01897415274183544
"Textpresso information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Biomedical researchers need to read or skim many thousands of scientific articles each year, more than is humanly possible. This project will extend and improve an automatic system, Textpresso, that finds relevant sentences within millions of sentences that likely contain crucial information. Textpresso also extracts some types of information automatically, making it possible to have organized databases of important information.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the three years since the original proposal was submitted, the claims we made about the impending readiness of knowledge-based approaches and natural language processing to address pressing problems of information overload in molecular biology have been resoundingly confirmed, and such methods have become increasingly accepted within the computational bioscience and systems biology communities. We are now well into the era of broad use of semantic representation technology to support biomedical research, and at the cusp of the use of biomedical natural language processing software to create the enormous number of necessary formal representations automatically from biomedical texts. The results of the work during the last funding period have not only contributed    innovative and significant new methods, but have helped us identify a set of specific research issues we claim are now the rate-limiting factors in building an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. The aims of this competitive renewal are to address those factors, making it possible to scale our impressive results on intentionally narrow applications to much   larger (and more significant) tasks, specifically: (1) to create an enriched, relationally decomposed set of conceptual frames, hewing closely to multiple, community curated ontologies; (2) develop language  processing tools capable of recognizing and populating instances of those conceptual frames, and (3) develop systems for integrating and using diverse knowledge from multiple sources to generate scientific insights, focusing on the analysis of sets of dozens to hundreds of genes produced by diverse high-throughput methodologies.

Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. Our own research in the past has mostly focused on identifying genes and species in PubMed citations. In 2011-2012, while continuing our efforts in improving gene name recognition, we also turned our attention to disease name detection. Like genes, disease names are also irregular and ambiguous, making them difficult to be identified through simple dictionary look-up methods and an interesting task for the text-mining community. However, due to the lack of adequate training data, there has not been much work focused on disease name identification. To this end, we created a large-scale disease corpus consisting of 6,900 disease names in 793 PubMed abstracts. Developed by a team of 12 annotators (two people per annotation), our data corpus contains rich annotations for every disease occurrence in PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, disease names are categorized into four distinct groups: Specific Disease, Disease Class, Composite Mention and Disease Modifier. When used as the gold standard data for training state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms, significantly higher performance was found on our data than an existing one with limited annotations. Such characteristics make our disease name corpus a valuable resource for mining disease-related information from biomedical text.  Following named entity recognition, we also continued our research from previous years for automatically identifying relationships between various biological entities as an effort to build an end-to-end system that includes both entity recognition and relationship extraction. This year, our research emphasized on extracting pharmacogenomics (PGx) information from free text. Specifically, we developed a systematic approach to automatically identify PGx relationships between genes, drugs and diseases from trial records in ClinicalTrials.gov. In our evaluation, we found that our extracted relationships overlap significantly with the curated factual knowledge through the literature in a PGx database and that most relationships appear on average 5 years earlier in clinical trials than in their corresponding publications, suggesting that clinical trials may be valuable for both validating known and capturing new PGx related information in a more timely manner. Furthermore, two human reviewers judged a portion of computer-generated relationships and found an overall accuracy of 74% for our text-mining approach. This work has practical implications in enriching our existing knowledge on PGx gene-drug-disease relationships as well as suggesting crosslinks between ClinicalTrials.gov and other PGx knowledge bases.  As mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we conducted two separate investigations, one aiming to understand the needs of the curation community and the other directly improve links between literature and biological data.   Together with colleagues outside of the NIH, we organized the BioCreative 2012 workshop on Interactive Text Mining in the Biocuration Workflow, an international event for bringing together the biocuration and text mining communities towards the development and evaluation of interactive text mining tools and systems to improve utility and usability in the biocuration workflow. Specifically, we chaired the Workshop Track II entitled Biocuration Workflows and Text Mining where we invited submissions of written descriptions of curation workflows from expert curated databases. We received seven qualified contributions, primarily from model organism databases such as FlyBase. Based on these descriptions, we identified commonalities and differences across the workflows, the common ontologies and controlled vocabularies used and the current and desired uses of text mining for biocuration. Compared to a similar study in 2009, our 2012 results show that many more databases are now using text mining in parts of their curation workflows. In addition, the Track II participants identified text-mining aids for finding gene names and symbols (gene indexing), prioritization of documents for curation (document triage), and ontology concept assignment as those most desired by the biocurators.  Our second curation-oriented text mining research focused on directly improving links between literature and biological data. As we all know that in todays biomedical search, high-throughput experiments and bioinformatics techniques are creating an exploding volume of data that are becoming overwhelming to keep track of for biologists and researchers who need to access, analyze and process existing data. Much of the available data are being deposited in specialized databases, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for microarrays or the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for protein structures and coordinates. Data sets are also being described by their authors in publications archived in literature databases such as MEDLINE and PubMed Central. Currently, the curation of links between biological databases and the literature mainly relies on manual labor, which makes it a time-consuming and daunting task. Herein, we analyzed the current state of link curation between GEO, PDB and MEDLINE. We found that the link curation is heterogeneous depending on the sources and databases involved, and that overlap between sources is low, less than 50% for PDB and GEO. Furthermore, we showed that text-mining tools can automatically provide valuable evidence to help curators broaden the scope of articles and database entries that they review. As a result, we made recommendations to improve the coverage of curated links, as well as the consistency of information available from different databases while maintaining high-quality curation. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,8558092,ZIALM000002,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological databases', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer generated', 'crosslink', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model organisms databases', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2012,976145,0.06730793323869183
"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume. The goal of this project is to harvest large amounts of that information automatically, making it available to humans in summarized form and to computers in computer-readable form.",Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral,8318224,R01LM009254,"['Biological', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evaluation Research', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'scale up', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2012,572436,0.07369107829767027
"Phenotype Discovery in NHLBI Genomic Studies (PhD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Researchers continually upload data into public repositories at a rapid pace, yet utilize few common standards for annotation, making it close to impossible to compare or associate data across studies. To address this problem, we will develop a defined meta- data model and build an integrated system called Phenotype Discovery (PhD) that enables researchers to query and find genomic studies of interest in public repositories as well as upload new data into our database (sdGaP), in a standardized manner. A Query Interpreter (QI) will utilize text mining and natural language processing techniques to map free text into concepts in biomedical ontologies, allowing non-structured queries to be answered efficiently. In Phase I of the project, we will develop a proof-of-concept system that can retrospectively structure phenotypic descriptions in dbGaP, and will work with domain experts in pneumology to build use cases and evaluate the automated mappings. In Phase II of the project, we will extend the domain expertise to cardiology, hematology, and sleep disorders to build a more comprehensive system, expanding the phenotype annotation to transcriptome databases, and integrating a flexible automated genotype annotation tool for sdGaP. We will develop a user-friendly interface to prospectively assist researchers in uploading their data with standardized phenotypic annotations. We will provide the tool for free from our website and continuously improve its quality, based on user feedback and usage data.        Relevance Phenotype Discovery (PhD) represents a novel, automated system to describe the characteristics of patients whose genetic information is available in public data repositories, without compromising their privacy. This initiative is greatly needed so that more researchers can make use of data collected from projects funded by public agencies. PhD uses new methodology for natural language processing and semantic integration to interpret the narrative text as well as variables and their values from studies in genomic databases. Standardized terminologies will be utilized to ensure that data can be analyzed across different studies.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research  Project Summary (Abstract):  Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.  Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning. The goal of this project is to develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology and apply it to vaccine literature mining and analysis of vaccine-induced immune mechanisms.",Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research,8311060,R01AI081062,"['Algorithms', 'Attenuated Live Virus Vaccine', 'Automated Annotation', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Brucella', 'Brucella Vaccine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Ensure', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Vaccines', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Informatics', 'Information Networks', 'Information Retrieval', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Subunit Vaccines', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'data integration', 'editorial', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge base', 'microorganism', 'novel', 'novel vaccines', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'repository', 'research study', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation', 'web interface']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2012,264994,0.04420804832752861
"Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research plan: The use of clinical knowledge systems such as UpToDate that provide reliable information at the point of care has been shown to improve patient safety and decision-making. With similar content to UpToDate, Mayo Clinic's AskMayoExpert (AME) is an online knowledge system that primarily contains over 5000 (and increasing) specialist-vetted answers to FAQs for point of care use. However, because of the overabundance of clinical resources and guidelines, adding new answers manually to AME and ensuring that it is consistent with evidence is time consuming. This problem is also faced with other systems such as UpToDate. This career grant proposes to investigate the feasibility of using a novel text mining based informatics approach to semi-automate the management of a clinical knowledge system, using AME as the test bed. Although the methods will be applicable to any clinical knowledge system and any topic, they will be evaluated using two important test topics from cardiology (which has the biggest focus in AME) - atrial fibrillation (a topic exhaustively covered in AME) and congestive heart failure (a topic less covered, but is an increasingly complex vast field with knowledge from huge literature). While the existing content of AME is private, the methods and the code we develop to assist in generating the content will be released open-source as part of the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) consortium in UIMA framework. Career plan: As most communication of information in clinical practice and biomedical research occurs through the medium of text, the development of methods to render this text computer-interpretable is a prerequisite to the use of this information to improve quality of care and support scientific discovery. The PI's long-term career goal is to become a leader in biomedical informatics (informatics applied to biomedical data), with focus on textual data such as scientific papers and clinical notes. He has BS in Computer Science, PhD in Biomedical Informatics and over a dozen of peer-reviewed publications in biomedical text mining. His career goal is to advance diverse methods and applications of text mining across biomedical informatics (BMI). He will focus on: a) discovering information needs and gaps that can be filled, b) adapting and extending existing text mining algorithms, and c) validating the utility of the applications in the biomedical environment. Rationale: Making the transition from a mentored researcher to an independent researcher requires three main facets of career growth: a) developing a working familiarity with clinical information systems and medical terminologies; b) understanding the information needs of clinicians; and c) training in clinical research. The proposal will translate the PI's knowledgeof the text mining methods to practical experience in an operation clinical environment. Courses listed in the ""Career Development/Training Activities"" will educate him more about the environment and train him on clinical research. He will continue sharpening his informatics expertise by attending scientific conferences.              Project Narrative Medical errors are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. It has been observed that point of care access to relevant clinical knowledge support decision making and decreases medical errors, thereby improving patient safety and healthcare costs. The proposed research aims to empower physicians specialized in the area (specialists) in quickly gathering evidence from literature or finding citations supporting or qualifying their expert opinion. It will also generate the answers and suggest updates to the existing answers for their perusal.",Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs,8442618,K99LM011389,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Beds', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calculi', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Familiarity', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Physicians', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'medical information system', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'point of care', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'usability']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K99,2012,96552,0.0414015695248625
"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text. This project develop computational approaches to extract knowledge from biomedical literature, represent the knowledge in computable form, and combined the knowledge with experiment data to gain insights into biological systems and disease mechanisms",Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery,8326650,R01LM011155,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Yeasts', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'data mining', 'design', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'novel', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'text searching']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2012,317212,0.07442975388042296
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8242742,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Systems Development', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,392767,0.12310440125735977
"National Center for Biomedical Ontology    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): We propose to continue the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), which develops tools and methods for assimilating, archiving, accessing, and applying machine-processable representations of biomedical domain objects, processes, and relations to assist in the management, integration, visualization, analysis, and interpretation of the huge, distributed data sets that are now the hallmark of biomedical research and clinical care.

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain. Component-level evaluation        Specific Aim 3: Integrate best method and/or a variety of methods for temporal relation discovery into the open source Mayo Clinic IE pipeline and release as open source annotators in the pipeline. Functional testing. Dissemination activities.        Specific Aim 4: System-level evaluation. Test the functionality of the enhanced Mayo Clinic IE pipeline on translational research use cases, e.g. the progression of colon cancer as documented in clinical notes and pathology reports, the progression of brain tumor as documented in radiology reports.        The methods we will use for the temporal relation discovery are based on machine learning, e.g., Support Vector Machine technology. Such methods require the annotation of a reference standard from which the computations are derived. The best methods will be released as part of the Mayo Clinic Information Extraction System for the larger community to use and contribute to. We will test the methods against biomedical queries.           Relevance (max 2-3 sentences) Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments.

"Textpresso information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Biomedical researchers need to read or skim many thousands of scientific articles each year, more than is humanly possible. This project will extend and improve an automatic system, Textpresso, that finds relevant sentences within millions of sentences that likely contain crucial information.

"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for facilitating literature search, biological database curation and many other scientific tasks. Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, in PubMed queries a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. Our own research in the past has focused on identifying genes and diseases in PubMed citations. In particular, in 2010 we co-organized BioCreative III: an international challenge event for engaging the text mining community on finding gene/protein entities in full-length articles from the PubMed Central.    Despite efforts and advances, gene name normalization (mapping a gene name to a database identifier) remains a challenging task. Partly, it is due to the difficulty in finding and associating the recognized gene name with its corresponding species. This problem arises because species information is often not explicitly stated next to the gene/protein mentions or completely missing in an article. Hence, it requires automatic methods to infer such information when it is not readily available. To this end, we have developed an open source tool called SR4GN for species recognition and disambiguation in the context of gene normalization. SR4GN significantly extends our previous work via a set of new heuristics for identifying focus species in an article and inferring species when such information cannot be found. According to our evaluation on several benchmark datasets, SR4GN achieves state-of-the-art performance and compares favorably to other similar systems.   Another research on entity recognition this year lies in our work on normalizing drug names in PubMed Health drug monographs. Specifically, we developed an automatic pipeline for identifying a drug concept in RxNorm (a standardized drug vocabulary) based on its ingredient and dose form (the physical form a drug is produced and dispensed) in free text. Drug ingredient information was directly parsed from the monograph title. As for the dose form, heuristic rules and patterns were developed to extract relevant information from the body of the full-text monographs. Compared with a simple lookup method, our method shows significant improvement in F-measure. As a result, this research is employed to compute a list of drug brand names for each drug monograph in PubMed Health. Its results have been deployed and indexed in PubMed Heath to facilitate user access to relevant drug pages through drug brands (e.g. searching Tylenol to see the information on Acetaminophen).    In 2011, we also explored means for automatically identifying relationships between various biological entities as an effort to build an end-to-end system that includes both entity recognition and relationship extraction. In this research, we used the data from the 4th i2b2 challenge comprising a corpus of fully de-identified medical records with manually annotated information for clinical concepts (e.g. medical problems) and relationships (e.g. treatments improve medical problems). Machine learning was our main approach for this task. However unlike the traditional bag-of-words feature representation, we represented a relationship with a scheme of five distinct context-blocks determined by the position of two potentially related concepts in the text: the introductory, first concept, connective, second concept, and conclusive block. Experimental results showed that when used with SVM, this new context-block representation outperformed the traditional bag-of-words model. Our further analysis suggested that the advantage of such a representation is its capability in automatically capturing the relative word positives between concepts, which has been found critical in other studies as well. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,8344935,ZIALM000002,"['Acetaminophen', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological databases', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monograph', 'Names', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'PubMed', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Scheme', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tylenol', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2011,499678,0.01746918557439432
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the three years since the original proposal was submitted, the claims we made about the impending readiness of knowledge-based approaches and natural language processing to address pressing problems of information overload in molecular biology have been resoundingly confirmed, and such methods have become increasingly accepted within the computational bioscience and systems biology communities. We are now well into the era of broad use of semantic representation technology to support biomedical research, and at the cusp of the use of biomedical natural language processing software to create the enormous number of necessary formal representations automatically from biomedical texts. The results of the work during the last funding period have not only contributed    innovative and significant new methods, but have helped us identify a set of specific research issues we claim are now the rate-limiting factors in building an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. The aims of this competitive renewal are to address those factors, making it possible to scale our impressive results on intentionally narrow applications to much   larger (and more significant) tasks, specifically: (1) to create an enriched, relationally decomposed set of conceptual frames, hewing closely to multiple, community curated ontologies; (2) develop language  processing tools capable of recognizing and populating instances of those conceptual frames, and (3) develop systems for integrating and using diverse knowledge from multiple sources to generate scientific insights, focusing on the analysis of sets of dozens to hundreds of genes produced by diverse high-throughput methodologies. An innovative aspect of this proposal is the creation and application of novel, insight-based extrinsic evaluation techniques for such systems.          n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base,8117587,R01LM008111,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Budgets', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Linguistics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'technology development', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2011,597135,0.05847437886676278
"Phenotype Discovery in NHLBI Genomic Studies (PhD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Researchers continually upload data into public repositories at a rapid pace, yet utilize few common standards for annotation, making it close to impossible to compare or associate data across studies. To address this problem, we will develop a defined meta- data model and build an integrated system called Phenotype Discovery (PhD) that enables researchers to query and find genomic studies of interest in public repositories as well as upload new data into our database (sdGaP), in a standardized manner. A Query Interpreter (QI) will utilize text mining and natural language processing techniques to map free text into concepts in biomedical ontologies, allowing non-structured queries to be answered efficiently. In Phase I of the project, we will develop a proof-of-concept system that can retrospectively structure phenotypic descriptions in dbGaP, and will work with domain experts in pneumology to build use cases and evaluate the automated mappings. In Phase II of the project, we will extend the domain expertise to cardiology, hematology, and sleep disorders to build a more comprehensive system, expanding the phenotype annotation to transcriptome databases, and integrating a flexible automated genotype annotation tool for sdGaP. We will develop a user-friendly interface to prospectively assist researchers in uploading their data with standardized phenotypic annotations. We will provide the tool for free from our website and continuously improve its quality, based on user feedback and usage data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Phenotype Discovery (PhD) represents a novel, automated system to describe the characteristics of patients whose genetic information is available in public data repositories, without compromising their privacy.

"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software. Narrative This project will help biomedical scientists manage, understand and communicate the complex information they must learn from scientific papers in multiple biomedical disciplines. As a demonstration of this work, we will build a comprehensive summary of research underlying brain circuits involved in stress. Stress and anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health costs per year (source: Anxiety Disorders Association of America).          n/a",BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l,8055527,R01GM083871,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Discipline', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Maintenance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'PubMed', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'repository', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2011,248610,0.040548865514581506
"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,8138486,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,266112,0.05003299130474584
"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text.

"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology.

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8039246,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Systems Development', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,526649,0.12310440125735977
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain. Component-level evaluation        Specific Aim 3: Integrate best method and/or a variety of methods for temporal relation discovery into the open source Mayo Clinic IE pipeline and release as open source annotators in the pipeline. Functional testing. Dissemination activities.        Specific Aim 4: System-level evaluation.

"Textpresso information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Biomedical researchers need to read or skim many thousands of scientific articles each year, more than is humanly possible. This project will extend and improve an automatic system, Textpresso, that finds relevant sentences within millions of sentences that likely contain crucial information. Textpresso also extracts some types of information automatically, making it possible to have organized databases of important information.           Narrative Biomedical researchers need to read or skim many thousands of scientific articles each year, more than is humanly possible.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the three years since the original proposal was submitted, the claims we made about the impending readiness of knowledge-based approaches and natural language processing to address pressing problems of information overload in molecular biology have been resoundingly confirmed, and such methods have become increasingly accepted within the computational bioscience and systems biology communities. We are now well into the era of broad use of semantic representation technology to support biomedical research, and at the cusp of the use of biomedical natural language processing software to create the enormous number of necessary formal representations automatically from biomedical texts. The results of the work during the last funding period have not only contributed    innovative and significant new methods, but have helped us identify a set of specific research issues we claim are now the rate-limiting factors in building an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. The aims of this competitive renewal are to address those factors, making it possible to scale our impressive results on intentionally narrow applications to much   larger (and more significant) tasks, specifically: (1) to create an enriched, relationally decomposed set of conceptual frames, hewing closely to multiple, community curated ontologies; (2) develop language  processing tools capable of recognizing and populating instances of those conceptual frames, and (3) develop systems for integrating and using diverse knowledge from multiple sources to generate scientific insights, focusing on the analysis of sets of dozens to hundreds of genes produced by diverse high-throughput methodologies.

"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software. Narrative This project will help biomedical scientists manage, understand and communicate the complex information they must learn from scientific papers in multiple biomedical disciplines. As a demonstration of this work, we will build a comprehensive summary of research underlying brain circuits involved in stress.

"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7929664,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,277200,0.05003299130474584
"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology.

"A Resource for Biomedical Ontologies and Knowledge Bases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For more than two decades, our laboratory has been studying technology to develop, manage, and use formal descriptions of biomedical concepts. The result of this work is Protege, a workbench that allows users to edit and apply controlled terminologies, ontologies, and knowledge bases to a wide range of information-management problems. To date, more than 50,000 people have registered as users of the system. Many diverse projects in biomedicine-supported by nearly every institute and center at NIH-have become critically dependent on this software and the knowledge-engineering principles that it supports. This P41 competing renewal application seeks to continue support for Protege, as a biomedical informatics resource that will benefit the system's entire user community.      We propose technology research and development to expand the capabilities of the Protege system to meet the current and anticipated needs of the user community. We will re-engineer Protege with a service-oriented architecture that can adapt to the requirements of new ontology languages, large ontology repositories, and cutting-edge ontology-management-services, such as reasoning, alignment, and evolution. We will create support for collaborative ontology development, in the context of both large, centralized projects and open, decentralized efforts.

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,7774343,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outsourcing', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,525262,0.12310440125735977
"Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge Today, ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators, especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require the command of a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of experiments. In fact, ontologies are proliferating in all areas of biomedical research, offering both challenges and opportunities. One of the principal challenges of this field stems from the fact that ontologies are developed in isolation, rendering it impossible to move, for instance, from genes to organisms, to diseases, to drugs. The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) represents a fundamental endeavor in the collection, coordination and distribution of biomedical ontologies and offers an unparalleled opportunity to combine these biomedical ontologies into a single search space where genetic, anatomic, molecular and pharmacological information can be seamlessly explored and exploited as a holistic representation of biomedical knowledge. Unfortunately, ontology integration using standard means of manual curation is a labor intensive task, unable to scale up and keep up with the current growth rate of biomedical ontologies. We have developed a systematic framework for automated ontology engineering based on information theory, and we have successfully applied it to the analysis and engineering of Gene Ontology (GO), the development gene and protein databases, and the identification of peripheral biomarkers of disease progression and drug response. This project brings together a unique group of competences, ranging from ontology engineering, statistical signal processing, bioinformatics, cancer research, and clinical pharmacogenomics, to develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine and integrate biomedical ontologies and implement it as part of the NCBO architecture Ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of their experiments. In collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), this project will develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine biomedical ontologies. As a result, this project will integrate biomedical knowledge along dimensions that are today isolated and, in so doing, it will empower investigators with a new holistic understanding of disease, it will fast track the clinical  translation of biological discoveries, and it will change the approach to discovery, especially for those diseases that, like cancer, require a systemic view of their biological mechanisms.",Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,7945368,R01HG004836,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Information Theory', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Proliferating', 'Protein Databases', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'graphical user interface', 'information organization', 'instrument', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'sound', 'statistics', 'stem']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2010,428079,0.1273579152964283
"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7928868,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'natural language', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2010,605009,0.1336721856568742
"DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia constitute a major public-health burden due to increased mortality and morbidity and rising health care costs. Massive epidemiological data are needed to detect the small effects of many individual genes and the environment on these traits. However, sample sizes needed to make powerful inferences may only be reached by integrating multiple epidemiological studies. Meaningful integration of information from multiple studies requires the development of data ontologies which make it possible to integrate information across studies in an optimum manner so as to maximize the information content and hence the statistical power for detecting small effect sizes. A second compounding problem of data integration is that software applications that manage such study data are typically non-interoperable, i.e. “silos” of data, and are incapable of being shared in a syntactically and semantically meaningful manner. Consequently, an infrastructure that integrates across studies in an interoperable manner is needed to ensure that epidemiological cardiovascular research remains a viable and major player in the biomedical informatics revolution which is currently underway. The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGTM) is addressing these problems in the cancer domain by developing software systems that are able to exchange information or that are syntactically interoperable by accessing metadata that is semantically annotated using controlled vocabularies. Our overarching goal is to develop ontologies for integrating cardiovascular epidemiological data from multiple studies. Specifically, we propose three Aims: First, develop cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies for each of three disparate multi-center epidemiological studies that facilitate data integration across the studies and data mining for various phenotypes. Second, adopt a technology infrastructure that leverages the cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies using Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and caBIGTM tools to facilitate the integration and widespread sharing of cardiovascular data sets. Third, facilitate seamless data sharing and promote widespread data dissemination among research communities cutting across clinical, translational and epidemiological domains, primarily through collaboration with the established CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity which contributes substantially to rising health care costs and consequently constitutes a major public health burden. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental effects on these CVD traits is important. Massive epidemiological study data are needed to detect the small individual effects of genes and their interactions, and integration of multiple epidemiological studies are necessary for generating large sample sizes. Unfortunately, integrating information from multiple studies in a meaningful manner requires the development of data ontologies (language and grammar). Our proposal addresses this need, and does this in a way that is informative and user-friendly from the End User’s point of view.",DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE,7851333,R01HL094286,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Belief', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Family Study', 'Ferrets', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'design', 'experience', 'mortality', 'software development', 'software systems', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,474912,0.04103309234902546
"Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The rapid growth of the biomedical literature and the expansion in disciplinary biomedical research, heralded by high-throughput genome sciences and technologies, have overwhelmed scientists who attempt to assimilate information necessary for their research. The widespread adoption of title/abstract word searches, such as highly desirable the National Library of Medicine's PubMed system, has provided the first major advance in the way bioscientists find relevant publications since the origin of Index Medicus in 1879 (Hunter and Cohen 2006). The importance of developing valid information retrieval systems for bioscientists has led to the development of information systems worldwide (e.g., Arrowsmith (Smalheiser and Swanson 1998), BioText (Hearst 2003), GeneWays (Friedman et al. 2001; Rzhetsky et al. 2004), iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia 2005), and BioMedQA (Lee et al. 2006a), and annotated databases (e.g., SWISSPROT, OMIM (Hamosh et al. 2005) and BIND (Alfarano et al. 2005)).      However, most of information systems target only text information and fail to provide access to other important data such as images (e.g., figures). More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biological articles nearly always incorporate figures/images that are the crucial content of the biomedical literature. Our examination of biological articles in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) revealed the occurrence of 5.2 images per article on average (Yu and Lee 2006a). Biologists need to access image data to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. It has been evaluated that textual statements reported in literature frequently are noisy (i.e., containing ""false facts"") (Krauthammer et al. 2002). Capturing images that are experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit bioscience information systems, databases, and bioscientists.      Unfortunately, this wealth of information remains virtually inaccessible without automatic systems to organize these images. We propose the development of advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools to semantically organize images. We hypothesize that text that associated with images semantically entails the image content and natural language processing techniques can be developed to accurately associate the text to their images. Furthermore, we hypothesize that images can be semantically organized by categories specified by standard biological ontology, and that natural language processing approaches can accurately assign the ontological categories to images.      Our specific aims are:      Aim 1: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for identifying textual statements that correspond to images in full-text articles. We will develop different approaches for two types of the associations. We will first propose rule-based and statistical approaches to identify the associated text that appears in the full-text articles. We will then develop hybrid approaches to link sentences in abstracts to images in the body of the articles.      Aim 2: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic classification of experimental results into categories (e.g., Western-Blot, PCR verification, etc) specified in the experimental protocol Protocol-Online.      We will explore the use of dictionary-based, rule-based, image classification, and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      Aim 3: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic assignment of Gene Ontology categories to experiments, which will provide a knowledge-based organization of experiments according to biological properties (e.g., catalytic activity). We will develop statistical and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      We found that most of the images that appear in full-text biological articles are figure images (Yu and Lee 2006a) and we therefore focus on figure images only in this proposal. The deliverable of Specific Aim 1 will be an effective user-interface BioEx from which bioscientists can access images directly from sentences in the abstracts. BioEx has the promise of improvement over the traditional single-document-per-article format that has dominated bioscience publications since the first scientific article appeared in 1665 (Gross 2002). The deliverables of Specific Aim 2 and 3 will be open-source algorithms and tools that accurately map images to categories specified by the Gene Ontology and the Protocol Online. Those algorithms and tools will enhance bioscience information retrieval, information extraction, summarization, and question answering.          n/a",Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database,7534822,R21RR024933,"['Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Documentation', 'Flowcharts', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Index Medicus', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Western Blotting', 'abstracting', 'base', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'research study', 'tool']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2009,179517,0.0261699085188903
"Construction of a Full Text Corpus for Biomedical Text Mining    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       There is a demonstrated community need for an annotated corpus consisting of the full texts of biomedical journal articles. There are many reasons to believe that the rate-limiting factor impeding progress in biomedical language processing today is the lack of availability of the right kind of expertly annotated data. An annotated corpus is a collection of texts with information about the meaning or structure associated with particular textual elements. Annotated corpora are a critical component of biomedical natural language processing research in two ways. First, most contemporary approaches to language processing rely at least in part on machine learning or statistical models. Such systems must be ""trained"" on sets of examples with known outputs, so annotated corpora provide the training data vital to the construction of modern NLP systems. Second, annotated corpora provide the gold standard by which various approaches to particular text mining tasks are evaluated.

"Textpresso: information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated.

"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the three years since the original proposal was submitted, the claims we made about the impending readiness of knowledge-based approaches and natural language processing to address pressing problems of information overload in molecular biology have been resoundingly confirmed, and such methods have become increasingly accepted within the computational bioscience and systems biology communities. We are now well into the era of broad use of semantic representation technology to support biomedical research, and at the cusp of the use of biomedical natural language processing software to create the enormous number of necessary formal representations automatically from biomedical texts. The results of the work during the last funding period have not only contributed    innovative and significant new methods, but have helped us identify a set of specific research issues we claim are now the rate-limiting factors in building an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. The aims of this competitive renewal are to address those factors, making it possible to scale our impressive results on intentionally narrow applications to much   larger (and more significant) tasks, specifically: (1) to create an enriched, relationally decomposed set of conceptual frames, hewing closely to multiple, community curated ontologies; (2) develop language  processing tools capable of recognizing and populating instances of those conceptual frames, and (3) develop systems for integrating and using diverse knowledge from multiple sources to generate scientific insights, focusing on the analysis of sets of dozens to hundreds of genes produced by diverse high-throughput methodologies.

"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients. Relevance to public health: The proposed development of a readability assessment instrument and ""Plain English"" tool will help translating complex health materials into reader-appropriate texts. It has the potential of making the vast amount of available information in the health domain more accessible to the lay public.              n/a",Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts,7672256,R01DK075837,"['Address', 'Beds', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Labeling', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exercise', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health education', 'Home environment', 'Instruction', 'Internal Medicine', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Patients', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Smog', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer program', 'computerized', 'fourth grade', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'ninth grade', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'tenth grade', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2009,398216,0.004419697605908634
"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume. The goal of this project is to harvest large amounts of that information automatically, making it available to humans in summarized form and to computers in computer-readable form.",Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral,7781934,R01LM009254,"['Biological', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evaluation Research', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'scale up', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2009,505564,0.07369107829767027
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software. Narrative This project will help biomedical scientists manage, understand and communicate the complex information they must learn from scientific papers in multiple biomedical disciplines. As a demonstration of this work, we will build a comprehensive summary of research underlying brain circuits involved in stress. Stress and anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health costs per year (source: Anxiety Disorders Association of America).          n/a",BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l,7591237,R01GM083871,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Discipline', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Maintenance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'PubMed', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Strigiformes', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'repository', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2009,272818,0.040548865514581506
"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology.

"Onto-BioThesaurus: ontological representation of gene/protein names for biomedica    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term goal of our research is to develop resources and tools for knowledge retrieval management in the biomedical domain. As the pace of biomedical research accelerates, researchers become more and more dependent on computers to manage the explosive amount of biomedical information being published. The high quality of many databases is guaranteed by database curators who extract and synthesize information stored in literature or other databases. It is important to accurately recognize biomedical entity names in text and map the identified names to corresponding records in biomedical databases. Usually, a biomedical database provides a list of names either entered by curators or extracted from other databases. Those names could be used to retrieve records from databases or map names to database records by NLP systems. However, there are several characteristics associated with biomedical entity names, namely: synonymy (i.e., different names refer to the same database entry), ambiguity (i.e., one name is associated with different entries), and novelty (i.e., names or entities are not present in databases or knowledge bases) which make the task of retrieving database records using names and the task of associating names in text to database records very daunting. Additionally, biomedical entities can appear in text as short forms (SFs) abbreviated from their long forms (LFs). The prevalent use of SFs representing biomedical entities is another challenge faced by end users and NLP applications because of the high ambiguity of SFs.       Recently, ontology-based knowledge management is becoming increasingly popular since ontologies provide formal, machine-processable, and human-interpretable representations of the biomedical entities and their relations. We hypothesize that biomedical ontologies can be used to reduce the difficulty associated with retrieving records using names or mapping names in text to database records. Specific aims and the corresponding hypotheses are: i) develop onto-BioThesaurus by enriching BioThesaurus with gene/protein-related ontologies (Hypothesis: aligning gene/protein names to gene/protein-related ontologies can reduce the complexity associated with gene/protein names); ii) harvest synonyms for gene/protein classes and entities from online resources and text (Hypothesis: harvesting synonyms especially gene/protein SFs is critical since SFs are frequently used to represent gene/protein entities); iii) build a web user interface for gene/protein names and entries search and query through ontology-enabled onto-BioThesaurus (Hypothesis: enhancing BioThesaurus with gene/protein-related ontologies would enable us to build heuristic rules to enable machine reasoning); and iv) evaluate and distribute research methods/outcome (Hypothesis: evaluating and distributing research methods/outcome are critical to advance both basic and applied biomedical science.            The proposed research is critical for biomedical knowledge retrieval and management. It serves as one of the foundation for storing, retrieving, and extracting knowledge and information in the biomedical domain.

"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology.

"A Resource for Biomedical Ontologies and Knowledge Bases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For more than two decades, our laboratory has been studying technology to develop, manage, and use formal descriptions of biomedical concepts. The result of this work is Protege, a workbench that allows users to edit and apply controlled terminologies, ontologies, and knowledge bases to a wide range of information-management problems. To date, more than 50,000 people have registered as users of the system. Many diverse projects in biomedicine-supported by nearly every institute and center at NIH-have become critically dependent on this software and the knowledge-engineering principles that it supports. This P41 competing renewal application seeks to continue support for Protege, as a biomedical informatics resource that will benefit the system's entire user community.      We propose technology research and development to expand the capabilities of the Protege system to meet the current and anticipated needs of the user community. We will re-engineer Protege with a service-oriented architecture that can adapt to the requirements of new ontology languages, large ontology repositories, and cutting-edge ontology-management-services, such as reasoning, alignment, and evolution. We will create support for collaborative ontology development, in the context of both large, centralized projects and open, decentralized efforts.

"Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge Today, ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators, especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require the command of a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of experiments. In fact, ontologies are proliferating in all areas of biomedical research, offering both challenges and opportunities. One of the principal challenges of this field stems from the fact that ontologies are developed in isolation, rendering it impossible to move, for instance, from genes to organisms, to diseases, to drugs. The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) represents a fundamental endeavor in the collection, coordination and distribution of biomedical ontologies and offers an unparalleled opportunity to combine these biomedical ontologies into a single search space where genetic, anatomic, molecular and pharmacological information can be seamlessly explored and exploited as a holistic representation of biomedical knowledge. Unfortunately, ontology integration using standard means of manual curation is a labor intensive task, unable to scale up and keep up with the current growth rate of biomedical ontologies. We have developed a systematic framework for automated ontology engineering based on information theory, and we have successfully applied it to the analysis and engineering of Gene Ontology (GO), the development gene and protein databases, and the identification of peripheral biomarkers of disease progression and drug response. This project brings together a unique group of competences, ranging from ontology engineering, statistical signal processing, bioinformatics, cancer research, and clinical pharmacogenomics, to develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine and integrate biomedical ontologies and implement it as part of the NCBO architecture Ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of their experiments. In collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), this project will develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine biomedical ontologies. As a result, this project will integrate biomedical knowledge along dimensions that are today isolated and, in so doing, it will empower investigators with a new holistic understanding of disease, it will fast track the clinical  translation of biological discoveries, and it will change the approach to discovery, especially for those diseases that, like cancer, require a systemic view of their biological mechanisms.",Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,7558468,R01HG004836,"['Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Proliferating', 'Protein Databases', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'empowered', 'graphical user interface', 'insight', 'instrument', 'open source', 'programs', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'stem']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2009,428078,0.1273579152964283
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,7565504,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outsourcing', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,529858,0.12310440125735977
"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7684604,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Body of uterus', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'natural language', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2009,639134,0.1336721856568742
"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics. The efficient knowledge acquisition and management will enhance biomedical research regarding the mechanisms of diseases and drug discovery.          n/a",Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation,8133305,R01LM009153,[' '],NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,109860,0.02798255451650522
"DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia constitute a major public-health burden due to increased mortality and morbidity and rising health care costs. Massive epidemiological data are needed to detect the small effects of many individual genes and the environment on these traits. However, sample sizes needed to make powerful inferences may only be reached by integrating multiple epidemiological studies. Meaningful integration of information from multiple studies requires the development of data ontologies which make it possible to integrate information across studies in an optimum manner so as to maximize the information content and hence the statistical power for detecting small effect sizes. A second compounding problem of data integration is that software applications that manage such study data are typically non-interoperable, i.e. “silos” of data, and are incapable of being shared in a syntactically and semantically meaningful manner. Consequently, an infrastructure that integrates across studies in an interoperable manner is needed to ensure that epidemiological cardiovascular research remains a viable and major player in the biomedical informatics revolution which is currently underway. The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGTM) is addressing these problems in the cancer domain by developing software systems that are able to exchange information or that are syntactically interoperable by accessing metadata that is semantically annotated using controlled vocabularies. Our overarching goal is to develop ontologies for integrating cardiovascular epidemiological data from multiple studies. Specifically, we propose three Aims: First, develop cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies for each of three disparate multi-center epidemiological studies that facilitate data integration across the studies and data mining for various phenotypes. Second, adopt a technology infrastructure that leverages the cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies using Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and caBIGTM tools to facilitate the integration and widespread sharing of cardiovascular data sets. Third, facilitate seamless data sharing and promote widespread data dissemination among research communities cutting across clinical, translational and epidemiological domains, primarily through collaboration with the established CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity which contributes substantially to rising health care costs and consequently constitutes a major public health burden. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental effects on these CVD traits is important. Massive epidemiological study data are needed to detect the small individual effects of genes and their interactions, and integration of multiple epidemiological studies are necessary for generating large sample sizes. Unfortunately, integrating information from multiple studies in a meaningful manner requires the development of data ontologies (language and grammar).

"Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The rapid growth of the biomedical literature and the expansion in disciplinary biomedical research, heralded by high-throughput genome sciences and technologies, have overwhelmed scientists who attempt to assimilate information necessary for their research. The widespread adoption of title/abstract word searches, such as highly desirable the National Library of Medicine's PubMed system, has provided the first major advance in the way bioscientists find relevant publications since the origin of Index Medicus in 1879 (Hunter and Cohen 2006). The importance of developing valid information retrieval systems for bioscientists has led to the development of information systems worldwide (e.g., Arrowsmith (Smalheiser and Swanson 1998), BioText (Hearst 2003), GeneWays (Friedman et al. 2001; Rzhetsky et al. 2004), iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia 2005), and BioMedQA (Lee et al. 2006a), and annotated databases (e.g., SWISSPROT, OMIM (Hamosh et al. 2005) and BIND (Alfarano et al. 2005)).      However, most of information systems target only text information and fail to provide access to other important data such as images (e.g., figures). More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biological articles nearly always incorporate figures/images that are the crucial content of the biomedical literature. Our examination of biological articles in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) revealed the occurrence of 5.2 images per article on average (Yu and Lee 2006a). Biologists need to access image data to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. It has been evaluated that textual statements reported in literature frequently are noisy (i.e., containing ""false facts"") (Krauthammer et al. 2002). Capturing images that are experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit bioscience information systems, databases, and bioscientists.      Unfortunately, this wealth of information remains virtually inaccessible without automatic systems to organize these images. We propose the development of advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools to semantically organize images. We hypothesize that text that associated with images semantically entails the image content and natural language processing techniques can be developed to accurately associate the text to their images. Furthermore, we hypothesize that images can be semantically organized by categories specified by standard biological ontology, and that natural language processing approaches can accurately assign the ontological categories to images.      Our specific aims are:      Aim 1: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for identifying textual statements that correspond to images in full-text articles. We will develop different approaches for two types of the associations. We will first propose rule-based and statistical approaches to identify the associated text that appears in the full-text articles. We will then develop hybrid approaches to link sentences in abstracts to images in the body of the articles.      Aim 2: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic classification of experimental results into categories (e.g., Western-Blot, PCR verification, etc) specified in the experimental protocol Protocol-Online.      We will explore the use of dictionary-based, rule-based, image classification, and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      Aim 3: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic assignment of Gene Ontology categories to experiments, which will provide a knowledge-based organization of experiments according to biological properties (e.g., catalytic activity). We will develop statistical and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      We found that most of the images that appear in full-text biological articles are figure images (Yu and Lee 2006a) and we therefore focus on figure images only in this proposal. The deliverable of Specific Aim 1 will be an effective user-interface BioEx from which bioscientists can access images directly from sentences in the abstracts. BioEx has the promise of improvement over the traditional single-document-per-article format that has dominated bioscience publications since the first scientific article appeared in 1665 (Gross 2002). The deliverables of Specific Aim 2 and 3 will be open-source algorithms and tools that accurately map images to categories specified by the Gene Ontology and the Protocol Online. Those algorithms and tools will enhance bioscience information retrieval, information extraction, summarization, and question answering.          n/a",Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database,7314689,R21RR024933,"['Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Documentation', 'Flowcharts', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Index Medicus', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Title', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Western Blotting', 'abstracting', 'base', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'research study', 'tool']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2008,230085,0.0261699085188903
"Construction of a Full Text Corpus for Biomedical Text Mining    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       There is a demonstrated community need for an annotated corpus consisting of the full texts of biomedical journal articles. There are many reasons to believe that the rate-limiting factor impeding progress in biomedical language processing today is the lack of availability of the right kind of expertly annotated data. An annotated corpus is a collection of texts with information about the meaning or structure associated with particular textual elements. Annotated corpora are a critical component of biomedical natural language processing research in two ways. First, most contemporary approaches to language processing rely at least in part on machine learning or statistical models. Such systems must be ""trained"" on sets of examples with known outputs, so annotated corpora provide the training data vital to the construction of modern NLP systems. Second, annotated corpora provide the gold standard by which various approaches to particular text mining tasks are evaluated. Due to their central roles in training and testing language processing systems, the quality of the design and operational creation of annotated corpora place fundamental limits on what can be accomplished with such systems. Although there has been valuable work done on annotating abstracts, there are important differences between abstracts and full-text articles from a text mining perspective, and annotation of full-text journal articles has been negligible. Workers in both the biological (especially model organism database curation) community and the text mining community have independently pointed out the importance of processing the full text of scientific publications if the biomedical world is to be able to fully utilize text mining. We propose to build a large, fully annotated corpus consisting of full texts of biomedical journal articles. Additionally, previous biomedical corpus annotation efforts have often utilized ad hoc ontologies that have limited their utility outside of the groups that created them. We will ensure community acceptability by annotating with respect to community-consensus ontologies such as the Gene Ontology and the UMLS. Since the task involves expensive human labor, efficiency is a key issue in creating corpora. For this reason, we propose to build a team that includes the builder of the largest semantically annotated corpus to date, one of the pioneers of the model organism databases, and an already-assembled cadre of experienced linguistic and domain-expert annotators.             n/a",Construction of a Full Text Corpus for Biomedical Text Mining,7495148,G08LM009639,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body of uterus', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Rate', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'text searching', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,G08,2008,132030,0.06923353173005463
"Adaptive Information Monitoring and Extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       It is now widely recognized that there is a great need for more powerful automated methods to assist biomedical scientists in filtering, querying, and extracting information from the scientific literature. Building on our past research accomplishments in biomedical text mining, we plan to develop new algorithms and software systems that will significantly improve the ability of biomedical researchers to exploit the scientific literature. In particular, we plan to develop, evaluate and field systems that (1) aid in annotating high-throughput experiments by extracting and organizing information from text sources, and (2) assist genome database curators by identifying relevant articles and predicting appropriate ontology codes for specific query genes and proteins.

"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics. The efficient knowledge acquisition and management will enhance biomedical research regarding the mechanisms of diseases and drug discovery.          n/a",Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation,7470146,R01LM009153,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body of uterus', 'Calculi', 'Classification', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'indexing', 'knowledge of results', 'markov model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein function']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2008,278208,0.02798255451650522
"Beyond Abstracts:  Issues in Mining Full Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Biomedical language processing, the application of computational techniques to human-generated texts in biomedicine, is an increasingly important enabling technology for basic and applied biomedical research. The exponential growth of the peer-reviewed literature and the breakdown of disciplinary boundaries associated with high-throughput techniques have increased the importance of automated tools for keeping scientists abreast of all of the published material relevant to their work. However, despite decades of research, the performance of state-of-the-art tools for basic language processing tasks like information extraction and document retrieval remain below the level necessary for adequate utility and widespread adoption of this technology. The development, performance and evaluation of text mining systems depend crucially on the availability of appropriate corpora: collections of representative documents that have been annotated with human judgments relevant to a language-processing task. Corpora play two roles in the development of this technology: first, they act as ""gold standards"" by which alternative automated methods can be fairly compared, and second, they provide data for the training of statistical and machine learning systems that create empirical models of patterns in language use. The conventional view is that corpora are neutral, random samples of the domain of interest. Our preliminary work suggests that the restrictions in size, quality, genre, and representational schema of the small number of existing corpora are themselves a critical limiting factor for near-term breakthroughs in biomedical text processing technology. Therefore, we propose to test the following hypothesis: Creation of large, high-quality, biomedical corpora from multiple genres will lead to significant improvements in the performance of biomedical text mining systems and the creation of new approaches to text mining tasks. Specific aims include constructing several large corpora covering a range of genres and incorporating a rich knowledge representation; identifying factors that affect differential performance on full text versus abstracts; and developing new methods for language processing, especially of full text. Because improvements in the ability to automatically extract information from many textual genres will assist scientists and clinicians in the crucial task of keeping up with the burgeoning biomedical literature, the potential public health impact is quite large.          n/a",Beyond Abstracts:  Issues in Mining Full Texts,7488396,R01LM009254,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Arts', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body of uterus', 'Collection', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'concept', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interest', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'technology development', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2008,268713,0.0516152508965295
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the three years since the original proposal was submitted, the claims we made about the impending readiness of knowledge-based approaches and natural language processing to address pressing problems of information overload in molecular biology have been resoundingly confirmed, and such methods have become increasingly accepted within the computational bioscience and systems biology communities. We are now well into the era of broad use of semantic representation technology to support biomedical research, and at the cusp of the use of biomedical natural language processing software to create the enormous number of necessary formal representations automatically from biomedical texts. The results of the work during the last funding period have not only contributed    innovative and significant new methods, but have helped us identify a set of specific research issues we claim are now the rate-limiting factors in building an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. The aims of this competitive renewal are to address those factors, making it possible to scale our impressive results on intentionally narrow applications to much   larger (and more significant) tasks, specifically: (1) to create an enriched, relationally decomposed set of conceptual frames, hewing closely to multiple, community curated ontologies; (2) develop language  processing tools capable of recognizing and populating instances of those conceptual frames, and (3) develop systems for integrating and using diverse knowledge from multiple sources to generate scientific insights, focusing on the analysis of sets of dozens to hundreds of genes produced by diverse high-throughput methodologies.

"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension.

"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software. Narrative This project will help biomedical scientists manage, understand and communicate the complex information they must learn from scientific papers in multiple biomedical disciplines. As a demonstration of this work, we will build a comprehensive summary of research underlying brain circuits involved in stress. Stress and anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health costs per year (source: Anxiety Disorders Association of America).          n/a",BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l,7426246,R01GM083871,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Discipline', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Funding', 'GDF15 gene', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Maintenance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'PLAB Protein', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'PubMed', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Reading', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Strigiformes', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'repository', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2008,266213,0.040548865514581506
"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7467204,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Today', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,280000,0.05003299130474584
"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7502636,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Body of uterus', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2008,640921,0.1336721856568742
"Construction of a Full Text Corpus for Biomedical Text Mining    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       There is a demonstrated community need for an annotated corpus consisting of the full texts of biomedical journal articles. There are many reasons to believe that the rate-limiting factor impeding progress in biomedical language processing today is the lack of availability of the right kind of expertly annotated data. An annotated corpus is a collection of texts with information about the meaning or structure associated with particular textual elements. Annotated corpora are a critical component of biomedical natural language processing research in two ways. First, most contemporary approaches to language processing rely at least in part on machine learning or statistical models. Such systems must be ""trained"" on sets of examples with known outputs, so annotated corpora provide the training data vital to the construction of modern NLP systems. Second, annotated corpora provide the gold standard by which various approaches to particular text mining tasks are evaluated. Due to their central roles in training and testing language processing systems, the quality of the design and operational creation of annotated corpora place fundamental limits on what can be accomplished with such systems. Although there has been valuable work done on annotating abstracts, there are important differences between abstracts and full-text articles from a text mining perspective, and annotation of full-text journal articles has been negligible. Workers in both the biological (especially model organism database curation) community and the text mining community have independently pointed out the importance of processing the full text of scientific publications if the biomedical world is to be able to fully utilize text mining. We propose to build a large, fully annotated corpus consisting of full texts of biomedical journal articles. Additionally, previous biomedical corpus annotation efforts have often utilized ad hoc ontologies that have limited their utility outside of the groups that created them. We will ensure community acceptability by annotating with respect to community-consensus ontologies such as the Gene Ontology and the UMLS. Since the task involves expensive human labor, efficiency is a key issue in creating corpora. For this reason, we propose to build a team that includes the builder of the largest semantically annotated corpus to date, one of the pioneers of the model organism databases, and an already-assembled cadre of experienced linguistic and domain-expert annotators.             n/a",Construction of a Full Text Corpus for Biomedical Text Mining,7301251,G08LM009639,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body of uterus', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Rate', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'text searching', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,G08,2007,130432,0.06923353173005463
"Adaptive Information Monitoring and Extraction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       It is now widely recognized that there is a great need for more powerful automated methods to assist biomedical scientists in filtering, querying, and extracting information from the scientific literature. Building on our past research accomplishments in biomedical text mining, we plan to develop new algorithms and software systems that will significantly improve the ability of biomedical researchers to exploit the scientific literature. In particular, we plan to develop, evaluate and field systems that (1) aid in annotating high-throughput experiments by extracting and organizing information from text sources, and (2) assist genome database curators by identifying relevant articles and predicting appropriate ontology codes for specific query genes and proteins. In support of these systems, we plan to develop novel machine-learning based text-mining algorithms for training on coarsely labeled data, and inducing models of relationships among specific types of entities expressed in natural language.          n/a",Adaptive Information Monitoring and Extraction,7264196,R01LM007050,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arts', 'Class', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Proteins', 'RGD (sequence)', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'design', 'desire', 'genome database', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'software systems', 'text searching']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2007,279300,0.09158205521179119
"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics. The efficient knowledge acquisition and management will enhance biomedical research regarding the mechanisms of diseases and drug discovery.          n/a",Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation,7260682,R01LM009153,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body of uterus', 'Calculi', 'Classification', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'indexing', 'knowledge of results', 'markov model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein function']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2007,291350,0.02798255451650522
"Beyond Abstracts:  Issues in Mining Full Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Biomedical language processing, the application of computational techniques to human-generated texts in biomedicine, is an increasingly important enabling technology for basic and applied biomedical research. The exponential growth of the peer-reviewed literature and the breakdown of disciplinary boundaries associated with high-throughput techniques have increased the importance of automated tools for keeping scientists abreast of all of the published material relevant to their work. However, despite decades of research, the performance of state-of-the-art tools for basic language processing tasks like information extraction and document retrieval remain below the level necessary for adequate utility and widespread adoption of this technology. The development, performance and evaluation of text mining systems depend crucially on the availability of appropriate corpora: collections of representative documents that have been annotated with human judgments relevant to a language-processing task. Corpora play two roles in the development of this technology: first, they act as ""gold standards"" by which alternative automated methods can be fairly compared, and second, they provide data for the training of statistical and machine learning systems that create empirical models of patterns in language use. The conventional view is that corpora are neutral, random samples of the domain of interest. Our preliminary work suggests that the restrictions in size, quality, genre, and representational schema of the small number of existing corpora are themselves a critical limiting factor for near-term breakthroughs in biomedical text processing technology. Therefore, we propose to test the following hypothesis: Creation of large, high-quality, biomedical corpora from multiple genres will lead to significant improvements in the performance of biomedical text mining systems and the creation of new approaches to text mining tasks. Specific aims include constructing several large corpora covering a range of genres and incorporating a rich knowledge representation; identifying factors that affect differential performance on full text versus abstracts; and developing new methods for language processing, especially of full text. Because improvements in the ability to automatically extract information from many textual genres will assist scientists and clinicians in the crucial task of keeping up with the burgeoning biomedical literature, the potential public health impact is quite large.          n/a",Beyond Abstracts:  Issues in Mining Full Texts,7287359,R01LM009254,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Arts', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body of uterus', 'Collection', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'concept', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interest', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'technology development', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2007,350638,0.0516152508965295
"Improving Health Outcomes through Computer Generation of Reader-Appropriate Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have shown that the readability of the health information provided to consumers does not match their general reading levels (Rudd, Moeykens et al. 2000). Even with the efforts of healthcare providers and writers to make materials more readable, today most patient-oriented Web sites, pamphlets, drug-labels, and discharge instructions still require the consumer to have a tenth grade reading level or higher (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer et al. 2004). Not infrequently, however, consumer reading levels are as low as fourth grade. To address this problem, we propose developing a computer-based method for providing texts of appropriate readability to a consumer. Recent progress in statistical natural language processing techniques (Barzilay 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad 2003; Elhadad, McKeown et al. 2005) lead us to believe that computer programs can be developed to dramatically increase the range and amount of readable content available to consumers. It may also help improve comprehension, self management and eventually clinical outcome. The general goal of this project is to provide consumers with readable content through the automated translation of content from difficult to understand to easy to understand. The specific aims are 1. To develop a computerized instrument for assessing the readability of health texts. We will enhance existing readability instruments (Zakaluk and Samuels March 1, 1988) by including measurements of health term difficulty, text cohesion, and content organization and layout. 2. To develop a ""Plain English"" tool for translating complex health texts into new versions at targeted readability levels with no critical information loss, using statistical natural language processing techniques. 3. To conduct an evaluation study to verify that providing content with appropriate readability has a positive impact on reader comprehension. We will use as a test bed for our system a general internal medicine clinic and its diabetes patients. We will provide self-care materials to these patients.

"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology. The relevance of this work for public health is that comprehensive integration and standardization of biomedical and genomics information is an essential component of advancing the understanding of the molecular systems underlying human health and disease outcomes.             n/a",Gene Ontology Consortium,7185305,P41HG002273,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology, Other', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comparative Biology', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'EST Library', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'comparative', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome database', 'human disease', 'interest', 'model organisms databases', 'repository', 'size', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,P41,2007,3146180,0.03300765945536491

"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing.

Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality.

"Automated Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Literature DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with information being published within their own fields, let alone biology as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are therefore becoming inadequate.      Here we propose to continue to develop our Medstract Project to apply recent advances in the computational analysis of text to organize and structure the biological literature. The Medstract project will reduce the time required for biomedical researchers to find information of interest and should facilitate the development of new research insights.  This project is the result of a unique collaboration between a computational linguistics lab at Brandeis University and a molecular biology lab at Tufts University School of Medicine. Previously we have developed an extensive set of tools for analyzing and processing biomedical text. We have used these tools to develop databases of biomedical acronyms, inhibitors, regulators, and interactors from Medline abstracts and have made these available on the web. These resources are currently used by hundreds of investigators every day. In addition we have generated and made available gold standard markup files for several biological terms and relations for use as testing standards by other groups developing knowledge extraction engines for the biomedical domain.      Here we propose to extend and enhance our current Medstract databases as well to generate new databases using the tools that we have developed. New databases will include protein modifications, domains and motifs, and tissue and cellular localization information. In addition, we will use the bio-relation databases as the foundation for constructing a system allowing point-to-point regulatory pathway identification. We will enhance the robustness of these databases by utilizing algorithms that we have developed for rerendering the semantic ontologies for the biomedical lexicon.

"Beyond Abstracts:  Issues in Mining Full Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Biomedical language processing, the application of computational techniques to human-generated texts in biomedicine, is an increasingly important enabling technology for basic and applied biomedical research. The exponential growth of the peer-reviewed literature and the breakdown of disciplinary boundaries associated with high-throughput techniques have increased the importance of automated tools for keeping scientists abreast of all of the published material relevant to their work. However, despite decades of research, the performance of state-of-the-art tools for basic language processing tasks like information extraction and document retrieval remain below the level necessary for adequate utility and widespread adoption of this technology. The development, performance and evaluation of text mining systems depend crucially on the availability of appropriate corpora: collections of representative documents that have been annotated with human judgments relevant to a language-processing task. Corpora play two roles in the development of this technology: first, they act as ""gold standards"" by which alternative automated methods can be fairly compared, and second, they provide data for the training of statistical and machine learning systems that create empirical models of patterns in language use. The conventional view is that corpora are neutral, random samples of the domain of interest. Our preliminary work suggests that the restrictions in size, quality, genre, and representational schema of the small number of existing corpora are themselves a critical limiting factor for near-term breakthroughs in biomedical text processing technology. Therefore, we propose to test the following hypothesis: Creation of large, high-quality, biomedical corpora from multiple genres will lead to significant improvements in the performance of biomedical text mining systems and the creation of new approaches to text mining tasks. Specific aims include constructing several large corpora covering a range of genres and incorporating a rich knowledge representation; identifying factors that affect differential performance on full text versus abstracts; and developing new methods for language processing, especially of full text. Because improvements in the ability to automatically extract information from many textual genres will assist scientists and clinicians in the crucial task of keeping up with the burgeoning biomedical literature, the potential public health impact is quite large.          n/a",Beyond Abstracts:  Issues in Mining Full Texts,7135482,R01LM009254,"['abstracting', 'human', 'language', 'performance', 'training']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2006,369593,0.0516152508965295
"Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal is for mentored training in the molecular biosciences of an established computer scientist. The training plan includes basic and advanced course work in modern biology, interactions with biological research groups, attendance at seminars and conferences, and laboratory training. Mentoring on the culture and practices of biomedical research will be provided by the sponsor. The training institution has a longstanding tradition of interdisciplinary research and specific expertise in cutting edge proteomics methods. The candidate will be fully committed to a combination of training and research. The research plan is based on the critical need to organize and summarize the knowledge in the vast biomedical literature. Curated databases are expensive to create and maintain; do not estimate confidence of assertions; and do not allow for divergence of opinions. Information extraction (IE) methods can be used to partially overcome these limitations by automatically extracting certain types of information from biomedical text.       In most genres of scientific publication, the most important results in a paper are illustrated in non-textual forms, such as images and graphs. The broad thesis underlying our proposed research is that one can provide better access to the information in online scientific publications by extracting information jointly from figure images and their accompanying captions. With the exception of certain previous work by the Murphy group, previous biomedical IE systems have not attempted to extract information from image data, only text.      This proposal addresses these issues in the specific context of fluorescence microscope images depicting the subcellular localization of proteins. This goal is consonant with a major focus of current biomedical research: the identification of expressed genes and the description of the proteins they encode. Motivated by recent large-scale projects which major focus of current biomedical research is the identification of expressed genes and the description (or annotation) of the proteins they encode, the Murphy group has developed automated systems for recognizing subcellular structures in 2D and 3D images. Automated image analysis techniques have also been applied to images harvested from online biomedical journal articles. This system will be extended to create a robust, comprehensive toolset for extracting, verifying and querying biologically relevant information from the text and images found in online journals. Based on this toolkit, a set of tools will be developed for aiding researchers to identify and locate information found in online journals. Upon completion of the proposed training, the candidate will be well placed to take a leadership position in machine learning applications to the range of experimental methods used in biomedical research.               n/a",Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics,7033080,K25DA017357,"['bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'gene expression', 'image processing', 'online computer', 'protein localization', 'proteomics', 'publications', 'training']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,K25,2006,133459,0.06930980289480228
"Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent decades, biomedical researchers are facing a new challenge that grows exponentially. The challenge is how to handle the large volume of biological data automatically generated by various whole-cell study methods such as genomics, microarrays, and proteomics. These new methods provide enormous opportunities for rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine because they allow scientists to study living beings in a global scale with greater speed. However, analyzing the data generated by these new methods can be a daunting task and often requires the development of specialized data extraction and conversion computer programs. Because only a few scientists are well trained both in life sciences and computer science, there exists a bottleneck between the great research opportunities these volume data can provide us, and the actual advances scientists can achieve from using them.   In this project, we propose to develop an auto-programming tool for biomedical scientists to help them handle the large amount of data in their research. This tool will observe the visual extraction and conversion of sample data by users via a graphical user interlace, i.e., through the point, click and drag operations familiar to most computer users. After that, it will be able to automatically generate computer programs that can carry out the same data extraction and conversion tasks for its users, on any new data. That is to say, by seeing a few examples of a user's data extraction and conversion needs, this tool can automatically turn that into computer solutions. Using this tool will be easy and will not require any sophisticated computer science training because it does the programming job for its users automatically.   This tool can have the broadest applicability in all biomedical research areas where textual format data are generated and processed with computational technologies.

"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Electronic medical record systems (EMR) contain a wealth of clinical data that is invaluable for biomedical research, but because there are no satisfactory methods to build coherent specialized knowledge bases, which represent the information in free text medical records, data mining and clinical discovery are held back. Medical Reporting Solutions, Inc. has developed advanced technology, which we propose to extend, refine, and test for constructing specialized semantic knowledge bases. These knowledge bases will encode the clinical information in medical reports, and enable automated natural language processing systems for extracting clinical knowledge.      Our research and development uses methods in corpus linguistics and sentential logic to represent the knowledge in free-text medical reports in an efficient, codeable manner. We have created tools to map sentences in a medical domain to unique codeable propositions. Our method for creating knowledge ontologies makes it easy for biomedical researchers to get semantic information at the appropriate level of detail. The knowledge base and mapping tables allow us to analyze medical reports in near real-time. One knowledge base, under development, is derived from hundreds of thousands of reports in the radiology domain, and we intend to analyze other medical domains using the methods we have pioneered.      Our phase one project plan includes further improving our knowledge editing tools, substantially enlarging our semantic knowledge base to cover over 60-70% of the radiology domain, and extensively test our knowledge representation schema against actual radiology reports. We plan to make the knowledge base freely accessible to the biomedical research community, while providing commercial services to codify free text reports found in EMRs. n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources,6988908,R43LM008974,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information retrieval']",NLM,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R43,2005,100000,0.0051302453880787404
"Biomedical Ontology and Tools for Database Curation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a new tool for text data mining-a biomedical language ontology and integrated natural-language-processing methods. Our long-term goal is to provide resources for biomedical knowledge discovery from text. Our immediate goal is to provide a knowledge discovery tool for the curation of organism databases such as the Genome Database (SGD). The proposed research not only serves the research needs of the SGD community, it also helps the broader biomedical community exploit the strengths of the comparative approach to biological research. The hypothesis of this proposal is that knowledge discovery from biomedical text requires a knowledge base that integrates both genomic and linguistic information. This hypothesis is based on two observations: (a) the language of biomedicine, like all natural language, is complex in structure and morphology (the basic units of meaning) and poses problems of synonymy (several terms having the same meaning), polysemy (a term having more than one meaning), hypernymy (one term being more general than another), hyponymy (one term being more specific than another), denotation (what a term refers to in contrast to what it means), and denotation and description (different ways of referring to the same thing); and (b) important biomedical knowledge sources, such as the Gene Ontology (GO), are expressed in natural language. The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1. Extend an existing biomedical language ontology to include genomic and linguistic data from SGD; 2. Use this ontology to discover, in full-text articles made available by SGD, information about the molecular function of yeast gene products that can be inferred from direct experimental assays; 3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the new tool and methods by comparing its results to those of the SGD curators for gene products that have GO functional annotations with evidence code IDA (Inferred from Direct Assay). n/a",Biomedical Ontology and Tools for Database Curation,6885487,R43HG003600,"['computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fungal genetics', 'information retrieval', 'information system analysis', 'molecular biology information system', 'yeasts']",NHGRI,"CONVERSPEECH, LLC",R43,2005,99250,0.1086651982776287

"Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent decades, biomedical researchers are facing a new challenge that grows exponentially. The challenge is how to handle the large volume of biological data automatically generated by various whole-cell study methods such as genomics, microarrays, and proteomics. These new methods provide enormous opportunities for rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine because they allow scientists to study living beings in a global scale with greater speed. However, analyzing the data generated by these new methods can be a daunting task and often requires the development of specialized data extraction and conversion computer programs. Because only a few scientists are well trained both in life sciences and computer science, there exists a bottleneck between the great research opportunities these volume data can provide us, and the actual advances scientists can achieve from using them.   In this project, we propose to develop an auto-programming tool for biomedical scientists to help them handle the large amount of data in their research. This tool will observe the visual extraction and conversion of sample data by users via a graphical user interlace, i.e., through the point, click and drag operations familiar to most computer users. After that, it will be able to automatically generate computer programs that can carry out the same data extraction and conversion tasks for its users, on any new data. That is to say, by seeing a few examples of a user's data extraction and conversion needs, this tool can automatically turn that into computer solutions. Using this tool will be easy and will not require any sophisticated computer science training because it does the programming job for its users automatically.   This tool can have the broadest applicability in all biomedical research areas where textual format data are generated and processed with computational technologies. Therefore, this tool will provide great enabling power to biomedical scientists to help them make rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine.   n/a",Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool,6549345,R21GM066400,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' biomedical resource', ' computer data analysis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' information retrieval']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2002,99510,0.03789415074417846

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,9949779,R01LM010090,"['Address', 'Apache', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Image', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohesion', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning community', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social media', 'support vector machine', 'symptom treatment', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,545793,0.020803738337968
"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. We have therefore focused on recognizing various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc, and their relationships.   Manually annotated data is key to developing text-mining and information-extraction algorithms. However, human annotation requires considerable time, effort and expertise. Given the rapid growth of biomedical literature, it is paramount to build tools that facilitate speed and maintain expert quality. While existing text annotation tools may provide user-friendly interfaces to domain experts, limited support is available for figure display, project management, and multi-user team annotation. In response, we developed TeamTat (https://www.teamtat.org), a web-based annotation tool (local setup available), equipped to manage team annotation projects engagingly and efficiently. TeamTat is a novel tool for managing multi-user, multi-label document annotation, reflecting the entire production life cycle.   To facilitate research in the development of pre-training language representations in the biomedicine domain, we previously introduced the Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (BLUE) benchmark, upon which we recently studied a multi-task learning (MTL) model, as it has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing applications. Our empirical results demonstrate that the MTL fine-tuned models outperform state-of-the-art transformer models (eg, BERT and its variants) by 2.0% and 1.3% in biomedical and clinical domains, respectively. We make the datasets, pre-trained models, and codes publicly available.   In 2019, we employed high-performance machine learning-based NER tools for concept recognition and trained our concept embeddings, BioConceptVec, via four different machine learning models on 30 million PubMed abstracts. BioConceptVec covers over 400,000 biomedical concepts mentioned in the literature and is of the largest among the publicly available biomedical concept embeddings to date.  Our own research and work from others have shown that text-mining tools have rapidly matured: although not perfect, they now frequently provide outstanding results. In a recent community article, we describe 10 straightforward writing tipsand a web tool, PubReCheckguiding authors to help address the most common cases that remain difficult for text-mining tools. We anticipate these guides will help authors work be found more readily and used more widely, ultimately increasing the impact of their work and the overall benefit to both authors and readers.   Separately, we have applied cutting-edge deep learning techniques to finding similar sentences in electric medical records, in a community task called Semantic Textual Similarity (BioCreative/OHNLP STS) challenge. The official results demonstrated our best submission was the ensemble of eight models. Our submissions achieved a Person correlation coefficient of 0.8328  the highest performance among all submission teams.   As shown above, deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, has showed impressive results in several of our recent studies this year. In addition to applying it to natural language processing, we have also seen its success in our medical image analysis such as processing chest X-rays, CT images, and various kinds of retinal images for autonomous disease diagonosis and prognosis.   As one of the most ubiquitous diagnostic imaging tests in medical practice, chest radiography requires timely reporting of potential findings and diagnosis of diseases in the images. Automated, fast, and reliable detection of diseases based on chest radiography is a critical step in radiology workflow. In this work, we developed and evaluated various deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for differentiating between normal and abnormal frontal chest radiographs, in order to help alert radiologists and clinicians of potential abnormal findings as a means of work list triaging and reporting prioritization. A CNN-based model achieved an AUC of 0.98240.0043 (with an accuracy of 94.640.45%, a sensitivity of 96.500.36% and a specificity of 92.860.48%) for normal versus abnormal chest radiograph classification. The remarkable performance in diagnostic accuracy observed in this study shows that deep CNNs can accurately and effectively differentiate normal and abnormal chest radiographs, thereby providing potential benefits to radiology workflow and patient care.  Another such project relates to Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries and, by 2040, will affect approximately 300 million people worldwide. Accurate AMD severity detection and progression prediction to sight-threatening late disease stage is thus of significant importance for personalizing monitoring and preventative interventions. As a joint effort between National Library of Medicine and National Eye Institute, we developed deep learning models for detecting reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) using fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images or, alternatively, color fundus photographs (CFP) in the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We demonstrated that the fully automated deep learning model was superior to existing clinical standards and has the potential for improved patient care. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,10261222,ZIALM091813,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Chemicals', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Evaluation', 'Fundus', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Information Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'National Eye Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'PubMed', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'data curation', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'improved', 'interest', 'language training', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multi-task learning', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'radiologist', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2020,1664656,0.03445715121304315
"Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks ABSTRACT Relations linking various biomedical entities constitute a crucial resource that enables biomedical data science applications and knowledge discovery. Relational information spans the translational science spectrum going from biology (e.g., protein–protein interactions) to translational bioinformatics (e.g., gene–disease associations), and eventually to clinical care (e.g., drug–drug interactions). Scientists report newly discovered relations in nat- ural language through peer-reviewed literature and physicians may communicate them in clinical notes. More recently, patients are also reporting side-effects and adverse events on social media. With exponential growth in textual data, advances in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) methods are gaining prominence for biomedical relation extraction (BRE) from text. Most current efforts in BRE follow a pipeline approach containing named entity recognition (NER), entity normalization (EN), and relation classiﬁcation (RC) as subtasks. They typically suffer from error snowballing — errors in a component of the pipeline leading to more downstream errors — resulting in lower performance of the overall BRE system. This situation has lead to evaluation of different BRE substaks conducted in isolation. In this proposal we make a strong case for strictly end-to-end evaluations where relations are to be produced from raw text. We propose novel deep neural network architectures that model BRE in an end-to-end fashion and directly identify relations and corresponding entity spans in a single pass. We also extend our architectures to n-ary and cross-sentence settings where more than two entities may need to be linked even as the relation is expressed across multiple sentences. We also propose to create two new gold standard BRE datasets, one for drug–disease treatment relations and another ﬁrst of a kind dataset for combination drug therapies. Our main hypothesis is that our end-to-end extraction models will yield supe- rior performance when compared with traditional pipelines. We test this through (1). intrinsic evaluations based on standard performance measures with several gold standard datasets and (2). extrinsic application oriented assessments of relations extracted with use-cases in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge base completion. All software and data developed as part of this project will be made available for public use and we hope this will foster rigorous end-to-end benchmarking of BRE systems. NARRATIVE Relations connecting biomedical entities are at the heart of biomedical research given they encapsulate mech- anisms of disease etiology, progression, and treatment. As most such relations are ﬁrst disclosed in textual narratives (scientiﬁc literature or clinical notes), methods to extract and represent them in a structured format are essential to facilitate applications such as hypotheses generation, question answering, and information retrieval. The high level objective of this project is to develop and evaluate novel end-to-end supervised machine learning methods for biomedical relation extraction using latest advances in deep neural networks.",Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks,10052028,R01LM013240,"['Adverse event', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Interactions', 'Encapsulated', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Heart', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Sciences', 'Intramural Research', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical care', 'deep neural network', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'protein protein interaction', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'social media', 'supervised learning', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2020,358691,0.034793948521434706
"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP Project Summary  Natural language processing (NLP) technology is now widespread (e.g. Google Translate) and has several important applications in biomedical research. We propose a new target for NLP: extraction of scientific questions stated in publications. A system that automatically captures and organizes scientific questions from across the biomedical literature could have a wide range of significant impacts, as attested to in our diverse collection of support letters from researchers, journal editors, educators and scientific foundations. Prior work focused on making binary (or probabilistic) assessments of whether a text is hedged or uncertain, with the goal of downgrading such statements in information extraction tasks—not computationally capturing what the uncertainty is about. In contrast, we propose an ambitious plan to identify, represent, integrate and reason about the content of scientific questions, and to demonstrate how this approach can be used to address two important new use cases in biomedical research: contextualizing experimental results and enhancing literature awareness. Contextualizing results is the task of linking elements of genome-scale results to open questions across all of biomedical research. Literature awareness is the ability to understand important characteristics of large, dynamic collections of research publications as a whole. We propose to produce rich computational representations of the dynamic evolution of research questions, and to prototype textual and visual interfaces to help students and researchers explore and develop a detailed understanding of key open scientific questions in any area of biomedical research. Project Narrative The scientific literature is full of statements of important unsolved questions. By using artificial intelligence systems to identify and categorize these questions, the proposed work would help other researchers discover when their findings might address an important question in another scientific area. This work would also make it easier for students, journal editors, conference organizers and others understand where science is headed by tracking the evolution of scientific questions.",Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP,10069773,R01LM013400,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Retrieval', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Students', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Work', 'design', 'dynamical evolution', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'journal article', 'news', 'novel', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prototype', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,462393,0.01610698812217324
"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9979969,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'public repository', 'repository', 'structured data', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2020,511367,0.06447116860245052
"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems. The Protégé resource provides critical semantic-technology infrastructure and expertise for biomedical research and the development of advanced clinical information systems.",Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences,9848600,R01GM121724,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Education and Outreach', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Letters', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'document outlines', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,559088,0.15242736337926718
