"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,9835005,F32GM134595,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Freedom', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human data', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical sciences', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61610,0.009296891345181166
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9765396,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2019,480000,0.027487916304933642
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,9699752,R35GM131845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth', 'Hermaphroditism', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'autosome', 'chromatin modification', 'condensin', 'dosage', 'histone demethylase', 'male', 'man', 'neural network', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'sex', 'sex determination', 'single molecule', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2019,466290,-0.0007778859390104767
"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9656869,F31CA221061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tweens', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2019,39107,0.03127589889397417
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery. NARRATIVE The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project will facilitate translational research by integrating and mining data about understudied druggable targets from numerous repositories and other resources. The KMC for IDG team will develop novel tools to analyze these data for the purpose of finding connections between genes/proteins/targets and diseases/phenotypes, cells/tissues, pathways/gene-sets, and drugs/small-molecules in order to identify potential applications to treat diseases and for other biological contexts of clinical relevance.",Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome,9623330,U24CA224260,"['Achievement', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Social Network', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time trend', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'community center', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data visualization', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'online community', 'outreach', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'repository', 'response', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning', 'web site']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2019,249999,0.0018073113572315519
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,9796943,R35GM133462,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'BCAR1 gene', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Floods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microprocessor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Transcript', 'base', 'clinical application', 'design', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'single cell analysis', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2019,385000,0.023948932604325728
"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling,9870316,K99HG010910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Biological Transport', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterochromatin', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Motors', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Outer Mitochondrial Membrane', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'active control', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell fixation', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education resources', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genomic tools', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanometer', 'neuropathology', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'ribosome profiling', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,137214,0.028104233632479804
"Genomic and epigenomic mechanisms of pediatric ocular disorders The Medical Genetics and Ophthalmic Genomics Laboratory has advanced the goals and objectives of the research program as follows:  1. Modeling novel associations of ocular syndromes with coding gene variation in zebrafish, mouse, and in vitro using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and developmental, molecular, and cellular biology investigations to elucidate disease mechanisms. We are currently modeling several new human disease genes in animal and cellular models. One example is CSDE1, a cold-shock domain containing RNA-binding program. We have shown that haploinsufficiency of this gene in humans causes a novel neurodevelopemntal disorder with autistic like features, short stature, relative microcephaly, and in some cases iris coloboma. This is consistent with contiguous gene deletions in humans, framing CSDE1 as the critical gene for 1p13.2 microdeletion syndrome. This manuscript is currently in press (Science Advances, 2019). Our group has also acted in collaboration to define multiple additional new disease-gene associations, including SMPD4, BMPR1A, and MYRF (see bibliography).  2. Defining disease-associations in the noncoding genome and in eye tissues using functional genomics techniques. Using RNAseq, ATACseq, and Hi-C, along with single-cell sequencing technologies, we are mapping the active genome in human ocular cells derived from induced pluripotent cell lines for variant prioritization from human sequencing data.

"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,9684263,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'progenitor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,485405,-0.03145501640744959
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9746755,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,400001,0.013110703909161634
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,9762097,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'human disease', 'human model', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2019,2265987,0.006122183629917317
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed.

"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9727999,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2019,550000,0.023758605861321214
"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear. In this project, we propose that by combining information about the gene activity and epigenetic landscapes of interneurons across multiple species we will generate an integrated, multi-layered portrait of interneuron diversity which we can use to understand brain",Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity,9754408,K99MH120050,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Lateral Geniculate Body', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental neurobiology', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'methylome', 'neural circuit', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills training', 'student mentoring', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,K99,2019,118421,-0.0004992866794076064
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm. Interestingly, I have developed new tools to study the controllers mediating this essential transfer of information. The objective of this work is to discover all the regulators and the ways they interact one with each other to generate a fully-grown organism because it will ultimately help to understand human development and disease.",Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development,9769091,K99HD093873,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Appointment', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fertilization', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Messenger RNA', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Oocytes', 'Organism', 'Play', 'Polyribosomes', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Prothrombin', 'RNA', 'RNA Conformation', 'RNA Helicase', 'RNA Probes', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'career', 'egg', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Stability', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,115350,0.01418841357952995
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9706661,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2019,480000,0.031156755419136112
"Computational Approaches for RNA Structure and Function Determination In collaboration with Shuo Gu, we have pursued a comprehensive examination of transcriptome-wide RNA-RNA interactions (RNA duplexes longer than 18 nucleotides) across 4 different cell lines using 3 different treatments (native cell lysates, removal of proteins, and removal of ribosomal RNA and proteins). MySeq reads were examined after treating with endoribonucleases targeting single stranded RNAs. These reads were correlated with a variety of computational bioinformatic analyses of the potential interactions. The prevalence or lack thereof was determined to enable a better understanding of how cellular RNA interacts with its cellular environment. Interestingly the major finding was that there are very few RNA-RNA interactions found across the 4 cell lines, thus indicating that such interactions are avoided. The number of interactions went up significantly when proteins were removed from the lysates and the sequences re-annealed. The majority of duplexes involved ribosomal transcripts. The diversity of results from the different cell lines suggests that RNA-RNA interactions are to a large extent stochastic in nature. Cells presumably avoid such interactions to prevent activation of innate immune responses, which are normally reserved for viruses. ---The functionality of Drosha in cellular systems is important for understanding the processing of microRNAs and how they relate to normal cellular activity as well as diseases such as cancer. In another collaboration with Shuo Gu the relationship of Drosha targeted stem-loop structures and the type of microRNA isforms that are produced was examined. Experimental and computational approaches were applied to determine these relationships. Results indicate that bent, distorted and/or flexible structures in the targeted Drosha stem seem to facilitate the production of alternate forms of microRNA. Structural predictions and experimental results were compared and correlated. Specifically, cleavage of pri-miR-9-1, but not pri-miR-9-2 or pri-miR-9-3, generates an alternative miR-9 with a shifted seed sequence that exapands the scope of its target RNAs. Interestingly, analysis of low-grade glioma patient samples indicate that alternative pri-miR-9 has a potential rolein tumor progression. ---A collaboration with Esta Sterneck's laboratory is ongoing. Her lab investigates cell signaling pathways involved in breast and glioblastoma tumorigenesis with a focus on the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD) using in vitro cell culture and in vivo mouse model systems. Using a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, her group has shown that CEBPD exhibits a dual role in mammary tumorigenesis. On the one hand, CEBPD prevents tumor multiplicity and on the other hand, CEBPD promotes distant lung metastases. In addition, CEBPD promotes stem-like cancer cells, which have been implicated in tumor metastasis and treatment resistance, in breast and glioblastoma tumor cells through regulation of various signaling pathways and stemness. In addition, strategies for targeting the message of CEBPD are necessary to down regulate CEBPD-mediated tumor progression signaling. As a tie-in to our nanobiology project, our laboratory is developing approaches for RNAi therapeutics to knock down the CEBPD mRNA by delivering strategically designed RNA nanostructures as their own entities or in combination with lipid carriers.Initial results with our lipid-based carriers look promising and we are currently progressing to the use of mouse models for further verification. --- In cell SHAPE prediction provides a new level of detail for determining RNA structure within cells. These results may vary from the more standard SHAPE techniques that do not take the cellular environment into account when producing potential structural predictions. We are developing a method for the computational prediction of in cell SHAPE by training a neural network (which has be optimized by hyper-parmaterization techniques) based on known in cell SHAPE measurements obtained from an E. coli database. Predictions, given a sequence, seem to be producing reasonably accurate results. This is the first time that computational methods have been applied to the prediction of RNA structure within cells based on machine learning. ---The prediction of RNA secondary and 3D structures containing non-canonical base pair interactions is a difficult and important problem that needs better algorithms. We are developing a set of computational algorithms based on Bayesian and neural network methodologies to enable the prediction of canonical and more importantly non-canonical base pair interactions in RNA. A large database has been compiled containing a multitude of structures including the non-canonical base pair interactions. The algorithms have shown significant utility, enabling the prediction of complex motifs at the secondary structure level. These results are then being used in conjunction with an RNA 3D structure generation program, which enables the prediction of 3D RNA structures that incorporate the complex non-canonical interactions. This set of algorithms are also being applied to the prediction of multi-sequence RNA nano-assemblies. ---In another project in collaboration with Mikhail Kashlev we are developing a methodology using a neural network approach(machine learning) to determine transcriptional pause sites in bacterial cells. Sequence reads are being produced by a method called RNet-seq (a variation of Net-seq) to define pause sites. The neural net being developed using these reads discriminates between these types of sites in various bacterial sequences (E. coli and B. subtilis). The approach seems to indicate that their are significant differences between these bacterial systems in regards go pausing. Sequence and structural variations around the pause site play a significant role in addition to co-factors. All this information in being incorporated into the machine learning approaches to aid in the discrimination process.---Another project in collaboration with Stuart Le Grice involves the development of a computational approach to determined binding sites and affinities of small molecules targeting various RNA structural motifs. The goal of this project is to aid in the screening of small molecules for their potential to be therapeutically beneficial in targeting viral RNAs or cancer causing genes. The small molecules are initially derived from sets found by binding to experimental screening methods using small molecule microarrays. The pipeline as it currently stands is able to determine to a reasonable level of accuracy ligand poses as well as the conformation of the binding pockets. It also seem able to discriminate between different levels of binding affinities for different ligands. ---An algorithm, RiboSketch, has been developed for the depiction of nucleic acid secondary structures which may contain multiple strands consisting of RNA or DNA. Layout algorithms, comprehensive editing capabilities, and a multitude of simulation modes are available within the system. Interactive features allow RiboSketch to create publication quality diagrams for structures with a wide range of composition, size, and complexity.

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs).

"Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the Data Generation Aim is to produce high quality data measuring phenotypes, protein and phosphoproteomics, and RNA expression in 30 cell lines grown on diverse microenvironments (ME). This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures. Our proposal to use MEMA technology will identify unique combinatorial MEs that perturb various phenotypic endpoints, providing novel data to fill in the LINCS data matrix.            ",Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks,9736777,U54HG008100,"['Adhesions', 'Antibodies', 'Apoptosis', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Database Management Systems', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Physiological', 'Protein Array', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Tern', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'high resolution imaging', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'novel', 'phosphoproteomics', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'senescence', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NHGRI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2019,1714600,-0.005175908512994727
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9666459,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,0.008811160300581291
"Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases Project Summary/Abstract Many diseases are understudied because they are rare or of little public interest. The effect of each understudied disease may be limited, but the cumulative effects of all these diseases could be profound. One common research challenge for these diseases is that the resources allocated to each is often limited. For instance, large- scale screening of drugs is often challenging, if not possible, in small labs. The decreasing costs of next generation sequencing make possible the generation of gene expression profiles of understudied disease samples. Integrating these expression profiles with other open data provides tremendous opportunities to gain insights into disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutics for understudied diseases. We have utilized a systems-based approach that employs gene expression profiles of disease samples and drug-induced gene expression profiles from cancer cell lines to predict new therapeutic candidates for hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma and basal cell carcinoma. All these candidates were successfully validated in preclinical models. The success of this approach relies on multiscale procedures, such as quality control of disease samples, selection of appropriate reference tissues, evaluation of disease signatures, and weighting cell lines. There is a plethora of relevant datasets and analysis modules that are publicly available, yet are isolated in distinct silos, making it tedious to implement this approach in translational research. A centralized informatics system that allows prediction of therapeutics for further experimental validation is thus of great interest to researchers working on understudied diseases. Accordingly, we propose four specific aims: 1) developing novel deep learning methods to select precise reference normal tissues for disease signature creation, 2) developing computational methods to reuse drug profiles from other disease models for drug prediction, 3) integrating open efficacy data to identify new targets from the systems-based approach, and 4) developing a centralized platform and promoting the platform in the scientific community. This proposal will reuse several big open databases (e.g., TCGA, TARGET, GTEx, GEO, LINCS, CTRP, GDSC) and employ cutting-edge informatics methods (e.g., deep learning). To demonstrate the scalability of the system, we will investigate three representative understudied diseases: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Aim 1), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (Aim 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Aim 3). Successful implementation of the systems-based approach can be used as a model for using other large open omics (proteins, metabolites) to discover therapeutics for diseases with unmet needs. This proposal will bring together experts in informatics, statistics, computer science, and physicians from Michigan State University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Spectrum Health. All data and code will be released to the public for continuing development. The system will be deployed to our OCTAD portal (http://octad.org), an open workplace for therapeutic discovery. Project Narrative About 25 million people are living with understudied diseases in the U.S. Although there are voluminous high dimensional molecular datasets that could be leveraged for research, individual labs have limited computational capacity to translate these molecular features into therapeutic hits. We propose to build a centralized information system that allows individual labs to easily harness open gene expression datasets and generate new therapeutic targets or drug candidates for further experimental validation.",Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases,9802075,R01GM134307,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Asia', 'Basal Cell', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Cancer cell line', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evaluation', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Ramp', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cancer gene expression', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'disorder control', 'drug candidate', 'drug mechanism', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'overexpression', 'pill', 'protein metabolite', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,453660,0.019718953706267778
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9654794,R24OD020166,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Human', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operating System', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'mutant', 'nuclease', 'recombinase', 'repaired', 'site-specific integration', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'vector']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2019,778412,0.018306029084250296
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9774233,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2019,303137,-0.022772469410671833
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way. While there has been great progress so far, current methods based on assembling the short reads into transcript annotations have reached a plateau. We propose two innovations that can help overcome the limits. The first is one-step simultaneous analyses of multiple samples in an RNA-seq collection, in contrast with the current two-step approach that analyzes each sample separately and then merges the results. The second is to create and interrogate assembly-free representations of AS. The project will design a suite of tools that will leverage the latent information in large collections of samples and from heterogeneous data types to build complete and accurate AS signatures of tissues and cell types, and to elucidate the regulatory circuitry of AS and its functional implications. Aim 1 will develop a high- performance multi-sample transcript assembly tool, combining subexon graph representations of genes and AS variations, statistical methods for improved feature detection, and search space reduction techniques for efficient sample processing. Aim 2 will build highly efficient and accurate feature selection tools to detect and characterize assembly-free AS variations (subexons and introns), simultaneously from collections of RNA-seq samples. It will combine novel regularized programs with complex models of intronic `noise' and other RNA-seq confounders, and enable analyses of differential splicing and to identify individual and group-specific variations. Lastly, Aim 3 will develop a system to comprehensively model the regulatory and functional circuitry of AS and the effects of mutations, starting from deep learning models of sequences and alignments and integrating expression, sequence, epigenetic and mutation data across tissues, cell types and conditions. We will rigorously test and evaluate all tools in simulations and on large public data sets, as well as on thyroid and head and neck cancer data provided by our collaborators, and we will experimentally validate random subsets of predictions with capillary electrophoresis and qRT-PCR. Collectively, the concepts, methods and tools will establish a new framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that can efficiently tackle the `big data' challenges, leading to more complete discovery and annotation of AS structure and function in human health and disease.   NARRATIVE Alternative splicing is a fundamental gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human physiology and disease. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is making it possible to characterize alternative splicing in great detail, however, current bioinformatics analysis tools miss important variations.

Exploring conservation of DNA sequence between species is a tool for identifying critical code that is likely to be important for functions shared between species.  Genomic information is deployed by transcription and differential expression may well be important for phenotypic distinctions among closely related species.  Comparative transcription has not been extensively explored. We are working on a genus-wide expression atlas of adult tissues and much of the raw data for this project have been deposited at GEO and the SRA for public consumption.  We have also begun a project to capture and reprocess all Drosophila data from public repositories world-wide, as well as defining the expression range for genes within a species.  These are valuable resources for our work and for the community in general.  How gene interact in networks is an important underpinning for understanding development, physiology, and disease.  We are looking at the transcriptional response to altered gene dose in aneuploid tissue culture cells, during X chromosome dosage compensation, and in a series of flies heterozygous for a tiling path of deletions (DrosDel).  We are mapping the coherent propagation of dosage effects elsewhere in the genome, and using the data to machine-learn network models to explain the observed patterns of gene expression.  We have developed several new approaches to network learning and we are beginning to test predictions with additional expression profiles following directed perturbation by RNAi.  We continue to pilot the use of small compounds and FDA approved drugs, RNAi reagents, Crispr, and genetic background, as tools to perturb gene expression networks. These data are providing important validation of connectivity maps and will allow us to add directionality to network edges, as well as help us understand how different individuals respond to common internal and/or external challenges.  DMRT transcription factors direct gonadal development in essentially all animals, but little is known about the gene networks they regulate. We are working on the function of the Drosophila DMRT (DSX) and are particularly interested in the identification of functional DSX transcription factor target genes.  We have previously used ChIP-Seq and DamID-Seq to determine the in vivo occupancy of DSX using tagged and native proteins in tissue culture cells and in Drosophila tissues and examined expression profiles in wild type and mutant conditions (especially those where we change the isoform of Dsx being expressed and measure the response over time) by RNA-Seq.  We are also performing knockdown experiments to test for the function of candidate DSX targets using RNAi (UAS-shRNAs driven by Dsx-Gal4 and other Gal4 lines).  We continue to work on selected potential DSX targets for detailed phenotypic follow-up to determine the function of these genes in the cells that are in direct contact with the germ line cells in the female and male gonads.   We have initiated new work on understanding the autonomous and non-autonomous effects (including non-autonomous blocked differentiation and/or stem cell tumors) of switching cell identity in gonads from testis to ovary and the reciprocal in specific cell types identified using single cell expression profiling. n/a",Drosophila Functional Genomics,10003745,ZIADK015600,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Dose', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Expression Profiling', 'FDA approved', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ Cells', 'Gonadal structure', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Ovary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Stem cells', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Testis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Stem Cells', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'differential expression', 'dosage', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic information', 'genome-wide', 'gonad development', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'learning network', 'literacy', 'male', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'repository', 'response', 'small hairpin RNA', 'sperm cell', 'success', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,ZIA,2019,1336542,-0.009146153900889563
"Predictable control of gene regulation through epigenetic engineering PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Recent landmark discoveries have revealed that in addition to DNA lesions, epigenetic mechanisms also play a major role in cancer. Epigenetics is mediated in part by interactions of proteins and DNA that confer heritable gene expression states. Drugging the cancer epigenome is a burgeoning medical technology that currently uses small molecule inhibitors and small RNAs to disrupt hyperactive epigenetic enzymes. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that a new modality, fusion proteins that interact with the chromatin fiber, will activate therapeutic genes at sites that bear a specific pattern of cancer-related biochemical marks. The specific aims are to (2) use bioinformatic analyses to discover chromosome features that support inducible changes in gene expression states and (2) to use protein engineering to identify determinants of nuclear protein engagement.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods to reactivate dormant therapeutic genes in cancer cells are limited to inhibitors that bind epigenetic enzymes and other proteins. The proposed work will establish a new technology: customizable synthetic proteins that control anti-cancer genes near cancer-associated biochemical marks.",Predictable control of gene regulation through epigenetic engineering,9827157,R21CA232244,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'C-terminal', 'Cells', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA lesion', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heritability', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncogenes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Protein Array', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Translations', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'chromatin protein', 'design', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein structure', 'recruit', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic protein', 'therapeutic gene', 'therapeutic protein', 'transcription factor', 'trimethyllysine']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,179671,-0.026490832566680295
"Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology There is now incontrovertible evidence from sophisticated lineage tracing studies that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) de-differentiation contributes substantively to a number of vascular diseases. A major manifesta- tion of such phenotypic change is attenuated expression of a battery of VSMC-restricted genes, including the enigmatic smooth muscle calponin (Cnn1) gene. The function of Cnn1 has been studied primarily in vitro or in a single knockout mouse wherein several exons and introns were replaced with a neo cassette which, as detailed below, obfuscates accurate interpretation of phenotypes. We have championed the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in mice to engineer subtle substitutions within regulatory elements of many genes, leaving intact all coding sequences. We report here a remarkable phenotype wherein a single base change of a single CArG box in the Cnn1 locus abolishes expression of CNN1 in vascular (but not visceral) SMC. Full expression of CNN1 is restored with a BAC carrying human CNN1 or CRISPR-mediated activation of the en- dogenous Cnn1 promoter. Cnn1 CArG mutant mice, representing the first animal models of regulatory element edits, also show elevation in VSMC DNA synthesis and defective contractile competence. Conversely, over- expression of BAC-CNN1 suppresses VSMC growth, antagonizes neointimal formation, reduces VSMC lipid uptake, and enhances contractile gene expression. Interestingly, CNN1-Ser175 appears to be a critical residue for some of these effects making it an attractive amino acid for CRISPR-mediated editing in mice. Additional data support CNN1 as a scaffold for ERK signaling and effector of the immotile state of differentiated VSMC. Importantly, a complete understanding of CNN1 function is complicated by robust expression of two related genes (Cnn2 and Cnn3) in VSMC. We hypothesize that CNN1 functions in concert with other CNN isoforms to maintain a mature VSMC differentiated state. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims using state-of-the-art tools in genetics, animal models of disease, and molecular physiology assays of VSMC function. Aim 1 will exploit the single base edit in Cnn1 as a novel loss-of-function mouse in context of acute and chronic vascular disease models; complementation studies will be carried out in vitro and in vivo to rigorously ascribe pheno- typic changes to the specific loss of CNN1. Aim 2 will exploit a well-characterized BAC mouse to elucidate functions associated with Cnn1 gain-of-function in models of vascular disease used in Aim 1. Complementary CRISPR editing of the BAC mouse, in background of Cnn1 KO, will afford exquisite insight into functional residues that mediate CNN1 function. Aim 3 will exploit new floxed Cnn2 and Cnn3 mice with an exciting VSMC-specific Cre driver we have developed to address, for the first time, triple Cnn KO mouse models at baseline and in acute or chronic vascular disease models. These studies, based on paradigm-shifting approaches to gene KOs, serve as a template for the study of other gene families linked to VSMC differen- tiation and will inform future studies targeting CNN1 in diseases where VSMC differentiation is compromised. Diseases of blood vessels involve radical changes in the normal program of gene expression and function, the underlying nature of which is poorly understood. We have used the revolutionary CRISPR system of genome editing to study a gene called CNN1, which is specific for smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. We will study this gene, along with related genes, in both cells and blood vessels to gain new insights into vascular diseases.",Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology,9671549,R01HL136224,"['Actins', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Injury', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Introns', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'LoxP-flanked allele', 'MAPK3 gene', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'base', 'calponin', 'cell growth', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'myocardin', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vascular smooth muscle cell migration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,602307,0.007128867388280321
"Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs PROJECT SUMMARY Short peptides (10-100aa) are important regulators of physiology, development and metabolism, however their detection is difficult due to size and abundance. A stunning 30% of annotated human smORF genes include disease-associated variants mapped within exons, compared to 15% of human genes in general. Further, many smORFs are conserved across the entire metazoan phylogeny from invertebrates to vertebrates including man. These ultra-conserved functional smORF genes we call the Conserved smORF Catalog or CSC. These genes have been conserved across more than 500myr of evolution, and yet we know almost nothing at all about their functions. Due to a century of genetic analysis, the genome of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has the most complete functional annotation among metazoans. Functional annotations derived from Drosophila have been instrumental in hypothesis-based drug development for more than thirty years, and more recently have made possible the biological interpretation of hundreds of SNPs detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hence, functional annotations derived in fly for conserved genes are transferable to human and are of direct clinical relevance. Remarkably, less than 10% of smORFs in Drosophila have been studied functionally, or experimentally verified as generating peptides. A combination of genome engineering, computational, molecular, and functional studies will be used to systematically and comprehensively characterize the CSC, representing the first genome-scale characterization of smORFs in any organism providing a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly studied class of proteins. In total, we will characterize and functionally annotate ~400 conserved smORFs using CRISPR knockout followed by phenotyping and rescue assays. We will assess the phenotypes of the mutants, measuring viability, morphology, fecundity and fertility, lifespan, metabolism (sugar and lipid levels), and a number of behavioral phenotypes. For smORFs with robust phenotypes, we will then attempt to rescue a subset of these mutants in three ways: first, by inserting the whole deleted RNA; second, with a version of the RNA with the smORF(s) removed by the addition a stop codon; and lastly, using a micro- construct containing only the smORF and the endogenous promoter. We will generate direct evidence for translation using tagged expression analysis and targeted MS/MS to scan for predicted polypeptides in the whole embryo and tissue dissection samples. In addition to validating the existence of the predicted molecules, this dataset will provide a foundational gold standard for further development of tools for the computational prediction of functional micropeptides. These studies are directed toward the understanding of basic life processes and lay the foundation for promoting better human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE As a public resource, our studies will combine genome-scale phenotyping with detailed functional characterization that will assess the effects of evolutionary conserved small open reading frames (smORFs) on animal viability, development, fecundity, metabolism, longevity and behavior. We will apply state-of-the art methods in Ribosomal profiling, CRISPR genome engineering and targeted mass spectrometry together with the development of new computational tools and analyses to generate a foundational gold standard dataset for the study of smORFs and the prediction of functional smORFs in genome annotation. Many of the genes encoding these molecules have been found to play important roles in human diseases such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders and cancer.","Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs",9729028,R01HG009352,"['Adipose tissue', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Arthropods', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Collection', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Fertility', 'Foundations', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Ontology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminator Codon', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'adipokines', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'drug development', 'drug resource', 'embryo tissue', 'fly', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in situ imaging', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'man', 'mutant', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'polypeptide', 'promoter', 'ribosome profiling', 'sugar', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational genomics', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2019,1002519,0.016644056524708357
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the

and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over

involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of

"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology.

ADRD continues to be an intractable age-related neurodegenerative illness in elderly without a cure. Numerous clinical trials have failed in result in effective therapeutic management of ADRD. This unprecedented 99.6% failure rate in drug development targeting ADRD is, in part, due to lack of sufficient consideration of novel molecular pathways and mechanisms besides the ones neuropathologically associated with different dementias. The main thrust of this proposal is to use automated algorithmic network predictions based on the meta-path approach, by providing the integrated database developed at the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Knowledge Management Center (KMC). Based on 13 distinct datasets totaling over 261 million datapoints, the AD-specific machine learning classifier model identified several key features, such as proteins that mediate inflammatory processes (JAK2, IL10 & IL2), response to oxidative stress (GSTP1), nervous system development (BDNF) and glycolysis (GAPDH). As a preliminary validation, we used human SHSY5Y cells that show robust hyper- phosphorylation of tau at S202 (itself a predictor of neurofibrillary tangle pathology relevant to ADRD) upon inflammatory stimuli (treated with cell supernatant from RAW macrophages). We used individual siRNA knockdown for the 20 predicted candidate genes in SHSY5Y cells prior to RAW macrophage media treatment, and assessed pS202-tau by Cellomics® unbiased high-content microscopy and quantitative morphometry. Four out of 20 candidate genes altered pS202 -tau levels in SHSY5Y cells, thus providing a proof-of-concept validation for the AD machine learning model. Based on this, we hypothesize that the AD-specific model is able to reliably identify novel biological datasets relevant to ADRD. We propose to test this hypothesis under three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will improve the meta-path machine-learning models and data mine novel associations. In Aim 2, we will perform in vitro biological validation for the top genes predicted by the meta-path approach. In Aim 3, we will build an interactive web platform to disseminate AD-gene associations. Successful completion of these studies will open up new avenues for ADRD research and may lead to novel therapeutic targets for ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the discordance between neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, ADRD, (e.g., amyloid beta pathology) and failed attempts to clinically manage ADRD therapeutically, there is an urgent need to identify novel drug targets. The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program, to which this supplement is linked-to, plans to utilize its integrated database to develop machine learning models that can predict novel disease-protein associations. Specifically, a set of 20 genes not previously associated with ADRD, were predicted using machine learning. Of these, 4 genes show significant biological effects (regulating hyperphosphorylation of tau at S202) in ADRD-relevant cellular models. The goals of this administrative supplement are to enhance machine learning models, to provide biological validation of candidate genes predicted from machine learning, and to propose novel drug ADRD targets.",Machine Learning Model Validation for AD/ADRD,9719312,U24CA224370,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Balance training', 'Biological', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Experimental Models', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GSTP1 gene', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'IL2 gene', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Resources Management', 'Interleukin-10', 'Internet', 'Ion Channel', 'JAK2 gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retroviridae', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Sports', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Transfection', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'forest', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'knowledge integration', 'macrophage', 'morphometry', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nervous system development', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'response', 'small hairpin RNA', 'tau Proteins', 'web app', 'web interface']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U24,2018,378750,0.006538454018514024
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9462855,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Canes', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Encyclopedias', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,327823,0.03767554501988837
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9566292,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,472478,0.027487916304933642

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery. NARRATIVE The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project will facilitate translational research by integrating and mining data about understudied druggable targets from numerous repositories and other resources.

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9543532,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,400001,0.013110703909161634
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,9564894,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'human disease', 'human model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2018,2270717,0.006122183629917317
"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9527894,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'duplicate genes', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2018,550000,0.023758605861321214
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed. Establishment of an analytically validated clinical assay will allow confirmation of the prognostic ability of the assay in clinical trials.",Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation,9427630,UH2CA207101,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'CLIA certified', 'Cancer and Leukemia Group B', 'Cessation of life', 'Cetuximab', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Adenocarcinoma', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mesenchymal', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective Studies', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Tumor Biology', 'Validation', 'assay development', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'drug development', 'genetic signature', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'irinotecan', 'molecular subtypes', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'oxaliplatin', 'phase 3 study', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prognostic signature', 'prognostic value', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,UH2,2018,214027,-0.0065621409370283275
"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9470767,F31CA221061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tweens', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2018,38615,0.03127589889397417
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm. Interestingly, I have developed new tools to study the controllers mediating this essential transfer of information.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9535392,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2018,552994,0.04096028814147634
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9565604,R01GM123037,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,302225,-0.017270856911642325
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9527869,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,472477,0.031156755419136112
"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders. Project Narrative It has long been known that there are many different kinds of neurons that are involved in controlling brain activity. However, it is unclear precisely how many different types of neurons exist, and to what degree human neurons resemble those of other animals. In this project we propose that by combining information about the gene activity in both human and mouse neurons we will begin to put together a final `parts list' of the nervous system which we can use to understand brain disorders.",Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species,9513320,F32MH114501,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'molecular pathology', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2018,51923,-0.011194395233338622
"Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the Data Generation Aim is to produce high quality data measuring phenotypes, protein and phosphoproteomics, and RNA expression in 30 cell lines grown on diverse microenvironments (ME). This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures. Our proposal to use MEMA technology will identify unique combinatorial MEs that perturb various phenotypic endpoints, providing novel data to fill in the LINCS data matrix.            ",Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks,9538214,U54HG008100,"['Adhesions', 'Antibodies', 'Apoptosis', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Physiological', 'Protein Array', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tern', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'high resolution imaging', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'novel', 'phosphoproteomics', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'senescence', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NHGRI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2018,1714600,-0.005175908512994727
"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9490337,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,397299,-0.018249874558070804
"Retinal Circuit Development & Genetics a) Temporal expression dynamic of Brn3a dependent RGC type specification genes. (Muzyka et al., JCN 2018) 	Brn3a is a member of the Brn3/Pou4f transcription factor family, which contains key regulators of RGC postmitotic specification. In particular, Brn3a ablation results in the loss of RGCs with small, thick and dense dendritic arbors (midget-like RGCs), and morphological changes in other RGC subpopulations. To identify downstream molecular mechanisms underlying Brn3a effects on RGC numbers and morphology, our group recently performed a RNA deep sequencing screen for Brn3a transcriptional targets in mouse RGCs and identified 180 candidate transcripts. We focused on a subset of 28 candidate genes encoding potential cell type determinant proteins. We validated and further defined their retinal expression profile at five postnatal developmental time points between birth and adult stage, using in situ hybridization (ISH), RT-PCR and fluorescent immunodetection (IIF). We found that a majority of candidate genes were enriched in the ganglion cell layer during early stages of postnatal development, but dynamically change their expression profile. We also document transcript-specific expression differences for two example candidates (Pnkd and Clcc-1), using RT-PCR and ISH. Brn3a dependency could be confirmed by ISH and IIF for a fraction of our candidates. Amongst our candidate Brn3a target genes, a majority demonstrated ganglion cell layer specificity, however only around two thirds showed Brn3a dependency. Some were previously implicated in RGC type specification, while others have known physiological functions in RGCs. Only three genes were found to be consistently regulated by Brn3a throughout postnatal retina development.  We have now selected a few of the more promising leads and pursue their RGC type distribution and involvement in RGC type specification.    b) Combinatorial expression of the Neurotrophin receptor Ret and Brn3 transcription factors in retinal neurons (Parmhans et al 2018).  Our gene expression profiling of Brn3 positive RGC populations suggested a complicated combinatorial code involving further transcriptional regulators and adhesion molecules involved in RGC type specification.  One dimension of this complexity is the neurotrophic support and feedback distinct neuronal subtypes might obtain based on their developmental niche and synaptic partners. We had previously established that Brn3s also participate in a combinatorial fashion in the specification of somatosensory neurons of the Dorsal Root Ganglion and Trigeminal Ganglion. Cell type specification of these projection sensory neurons is regulated by an interplay between transcriptional regulation and neurotrophic signaling, as exemplified by the work of our collaborator, Dr. Wenqin Luo, in U. Penn.  We therefore were curios to explore the expression overlap between the Ret neurotrophin receptor and the Brn3 transcription factors in RGCs, and found that distinct types of RGCs are differentially expressing Ret and and Brn3s in combination. We are now taking advantage of this knowledge to define the genetic interactions between ret and Brn3s in these RGC types.    c) Visual Behavior Tests:   We have imported the commercial version of our behavior system, produced by Phenosys GMBH, and integrated it in the visual Core of the NEI, where it can be used under the supervision of Dr. Hahua Qian, by all researchers of the NEI and NIH.  We are now implementing several new behavior tests looking at visually cued freezing and fleeing reactions, and have uncovered surprising new phenotypes in some of our genetic backgrounds. A manuscript is in preparation.   d) Multichannel electrophysiology for the analysis of Retinal Ganglion Cell Function (Ghahari et al 2018)  In this past year we have continued our development of a machine learning algorithm for the unsupervised detection and classification of RGC recordings from ex vivo retinas stimulated with a variety of visual stimuli. We had published a short report on a skeleton version of the algorithm, and have another manuscript for the full version under review. We now have finalized the spike sorting algorhithm, and published its application to a subset of our data on wild type retinas challenged with full field visual stimuli.  We have also implemented a novel GPU-based spikesorting approach, developed by Marius Pachitariu at UCL, and are applying it to our datasets. We have evaluated CMOS-based multielectrode array systems and identified a workable pipeline for our needs.   e) RGC-32 involvement in Th17 responses during experimentally induced autoimmune reactions (Tatomir et al 2018)  While in Dr. Horea Russ lab at University of Maryland Medical System, I had cloned and characterized RGC-32, a vertebrate specific gene upregulated in proliferating tissues, regenerative context, and tumors.  Injured tissues react by inflammatory responses that attempt to clear the noxious influence, but at the same time repair the damage.  Somatic cells can be affected in a variety of ways by these signals.  One type of adaptive response is the induction of stress response genes, assumption of less mature tissue phenotypes, or even reactivation of cell cycle.  Dr. Rus and I conducted a screen for genes induced by complement system challenge in primary oligodendrocyte cell cultures.  We further characterized one of the identified genes, RGC-32, and showed that it interacts with cell cycle regulators, and can positively or negatively affect cell cycle activation in different contexts. More recently, I have collaborated with Dr. Rus to generate a knock-out for RGC-32, and members of his group discovered that RGC-32 is highly enriched in T lymphocytes and can play a role in their differentiation towards the Th17 fate.  This in turn could affect the progression of experimentally induced auto-immune reactions (experimental autoimmune Encephalomyelitis EAE, a murine model for multiple sclerosis). Thus RGC-32 could be a potential regulator of tissue repair or regeneration, in particular in the context of inflammatory processes. During this last year we dug deeper into the mechanisms by which RGC-32 modulates the inflammatory response during EAE, and looked at interactions with the TGFbetta pathway, gliosis and scar tissue deposition. We are in the process of validating an RGC-32 conditional animal, in order to selectively ablate the gene from different cell populations involved in the autoimmune response in EAE, and further dissect its mechanistic role. n/a",Retinal Circuit Development & Genetics,9796714,ZIAEY000504,"['Ablation', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dependence', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis', 'Expression Profiling', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Freezing', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maryland', 'Medical', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve Growth Factor Receptors', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Prosthesis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Pupil light reflex', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Somatic Cell', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure of trigeminal ganglion', 'Supervision', 'Synapses', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior test', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'complement system', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'gene replacement', 'genetic manipulation', 'injured', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'negative affect', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'retinal neuron', 'somatosensory', 'tissue regeneration', 'tissue repair', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,ZIA,2018,1586247,-0.007088112798565618
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner.

"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a

"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,9238787,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Bite', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryo', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Ice', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'MYH11 gene', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'adenosine deaminase', 'calponin', 'gain of function', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2018,375000,0.026825412850320623
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states.

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Drosophila Functional Genomics Genome sequences contain the information needed for the development and function of a given species.  Exploring conservation of DNA sequence between species is a tool for identifying critical code that is likely to be important for functions shared between species.  Genomic information is deployed by transcription and differential expression may well be important for phenotypic distinctions among closely related species.  Comparative transcription has not been extensively explored. We are working on a genus-wide expression atlas of adult tissues and much of the raw data for this project have been deposited at GEO and the SRA for public consumption.  We have also begun a project to capture and reprocess all Drosophila data from public repositories world-wide, as well as defining the expression range for genes within a species.  These are valuable resources for our work and for the community in general.  How gene interact in networks is an important underpinning for understanding development, physiology, and disease.  We are looking at the transcriptional response to altered gene dose in aneuploid tissue culture cells, during X chromosome dosage compensation, and in a series of flies heterozygous for a tiling path of deletions (DrosDel).  We are mapping the coherent propagation of dosage effects elsewhere in the genome, and using the data to machine-learn network models to explain the observed patterns of gene expression.  We have developed several new approaches to network learning and we are beginning to test predictions with additional expression profiles following directed perturbation by RNAi.  We continue to pilot the use of small compounds and FDA approved drugs, RNAi reagents, Crispr, and genetic background, as tools to perturb gene expression networks. These data are providing important validation of connectivity maps and will allow us to add directionality to network edges, as well as help us understand how different individuals respond to common internal and/or external challenges.  DMRT transcription factors direct gonadal development in essentially all animals, but little is known about the gene networks they regulate. We are working on the function of the Drosophila DMRT (DSX) and are particularly interested in the identification of functional DSX transcription factor target genes.  We have previously used ChIP-Seq and DamID-Seq to determine the in vivo occupancy of DSX using tagged and native proteins in tissue culture cells and in Drosophila tissues and examined expression profiles in wild type and mutant conditions (especially those where we change the isoform of Dsx being expressed and measure the response over time) by RNA-Seq.  We are also performing knockdown experiments to test for the function of candidate DSX targets using RNAi (UAS-shRNAs driven by Dsx-Gal4 and other Gal4 lines).  We continue to work on selected potential DSX targets for detailed phenotypic follow-up to determine the function of these genes in the cells that are in direct contact with the germ line cells in the female and male gonads.   We have initiated new work on understanding the autonomous and non-autonomous effects (including non-autonomous blocked differentiation and/or stem cell tumors) of switching cell identity in gonads from testis to ovary and the reciprocal in specific cell types identified using single cell expression profiling. n/a",Drosophila Functional Genomics,9776067,ZIADK015600,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Dose', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Expression Profiling', 'FDA approved', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ Cells', 'Gonadal structure', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Ovary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Stem cells', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Testis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Stem Cells', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'differential expression', 'dosage', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic information', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'learning network', 'literacy', 'male', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'repository', 'response', 'small hairpin RNA', 'sperm cell', 'success', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,ZIA,2018,1578155,-0.009146153900889563
"Algorithmic approaches to systems biology, data integration, and evolution My group continued to develop and apply computational methods that utilize and integrate large data sets to study gene regulation diseases with main focus on cancer. We also develop method to study new emerging datasets including HT-SELEX data and single cell expression data.    Large data sets provide important window on human diseases (1). Within this general area, the main focus of my group is on developing new computational methods allowing to utilize large datasets (e.g. TCGA and ICGC) to obtain insists into etiology of cancer. In particular, we hypothesized that exploring the interplay between co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and functional interactions between genes will further improve our understanding of the disease and help to uncover new relations between cancer driving genes and pathways. Following our previous method to identify mutual exclusivity (2), we designed a general framework, BeWith, for identifying gene modules with different combinations of mutation and interaction patterns (3). We formulated the BeWith framework using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling us to find optimally scoring sets of modules. Our results demonstrate the utility of BeWith in providing novel information about mutational patterns, driver genes, and pathways. In particular, our approach identified functionally coherent modules that might be relevant for cancer progression. In addition to finding previously well-known drivers, the identified modules pointed to other novel findings such as the interaction between NCOR2 and NCOA3 in breast cancer. Additionally, an application of the of the method revealed that gene groups differ with respect to their vulnerability to different mutagenic processes, and helped us to uncover pairs of genes with potentially synergistic effects, including a potential synergy between mutations in TP53 and the metastasis related DCC gene. Overall, BeWith not only helped us uncover relations between potential driver genes and pathways, but also provided additional insights on patterns of the mutational landscape, going beyond cancer driving mutations. This results has been selected for a podium presentation  at the  premier conference in Computational Biology conference RECOMB 2017and the final results of this  study have been recently polished in PloS Comput Biol. (3).  Along this same line of research, recognizing that in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery, we developed  software to decompose a cancer genome's mutation catalog into mutational signatures.  In our recent paper 4 we proposed two complementary ways of measuring confidence and stability of decomposition results and applied them to analyze mutational signatures in breast cancer genomes. We identified both very stable and highly unstable signatures, as well as signatures that previously have not been associated with breast cancer. We also provided additional support for the novel signatures. Our results emphasize the importance of assessing the confidence and stability of inferred signature contributions (4).  With respect to our research on gene regulation, we continued our long-standing collaboration with Brian Oliver's group on gene regulation in Drosophila. We worked on a further development of  our novel network inference method NetREX, that given a context-agnostic network as a prior and context-specific expression data (e.g. expression in an adult fly), constructs a context-specific GRN by rewiring the prior network (the paper reporting preliminary results obtained the awarded the best paper award on  prestigious  RECOMB 2017 conference). We are preparing for publication a  paper describing further improvements and applications of this method.  As a part of the same collaboration we studied the impact of the impact of Drosophila melanogaster deletions on gene expression profiles.  Specifically we asked whether increased expression variability owing to reduced gene dose might underlie this phenotypic heterogeneity. Indeed, we found that one-dose genes have higher gene expression variability relative to two-dose genes (5). These results can help explaining  why DNA copy number variation is associated with many high phenotypic heterogeneity disorders.   We also continued developing computational methods for analysis of HT-SELEX derived Aptamers. Among our recent contributions is is AptaSuite, a full-featured, open source, and platform-independent software collection for the comprehensive analysis of HT-SELEX experiments (6). In stark contrast to previous methods, each implementing their individual and frequently rudimentary data workflow, AptaSuite provides a unified and robust framework for managing aptamer-related data and leverages this framework to serve the required data in a standardized manner to any particular algorithm built with the software. In its core, AptaSuite consists of a collection of carefully designed APIs (application programming interfaces) and corresponding reference implementations for facilitating input, output, and manipulation of aptamer data (such as sequences, aptamer counts in individual selection cycles, structure information, and more). We have recently applied our tools in a collaborative project to identify Aptamer for Ebolavirus Secreted Protein (7) and other applications (8).  One of the important applications of aptamer is related to  RNA-based therapeutics. The main idea is to utilize  synthetic RNA molecules to alter cellular functions. The success of this approach hinges on the ability to selectively deliver and internalize therapeutic RNAs into cells of interest. Cell internalizing RNA aptamers selected against surface receptors and discriminatively expressed on target cells hold particular promise as suitable candidates for such delivery agents. Specifically, these aptamers can be combined with a therapeutic cargo and facilitate internalization of the cargo into the cell of interest. This requires developing an approach design such aptamer-cargo complex.  In order to address this challenge, we have developed AptaBlocks - a computational method to design RNA complexes that hybridize via sticky bridges. This results was selected for a podium presentation at RECOMB 2018 and published in Nucleic Acids Research (9).

"Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs PROJECT SUMMARY Short peptides (10-100aa) are important regulators of physiology, development and metabolism, however their detection is difficult due to size and abundance. A stunning 30% of annotated human smORF genes include disease-associated variants mapped within exons, compared to 15% of human genes in general. Further, many smORFs are conserved across the entire metazoan phylogeny from invertebrates to vertebrates including man. These ultra-conserved functional smORF genes we call the Conserved smORF Catalog or CSC. These genes have been conserved across more than 500myr of evolution, and yet we know almost nothing at all about their functions. Due to a century of genetic analysis, the genome of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has the most complete functional annotation among metazoans. Functional annotations derived from Drosophila have been instrumental in hypothesis-based drug development for more than thirty years, and more recently have made possible the biological interpretation of hundreds of SNPs detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hence, functional annotations derived in fly for conserved genes are transferable to human and are of direct clinical relevance. Remarkably, less than 10% of smORFs in Drosophila have been studied functionally, or experimentally verified as generating peptides. A combination of genome engineering, computational, molecular, and functional studies will be used to systematically and comprehensively characterize the CSC, representing the first genome-scale characterization of smORFs in any organism providing a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly studied class of proteins. In total, we will characterize and functionally annotate ~400 conserved smORFs using CRISPR knockout followed by phenotyping and rescue assays. We will assess the phenotypes of the mutants, measuring viability, morphology, fecundity and fertility, lifespan, metabolism (sugar and lipid levels), and a number of behavioral phenotypes. For smORFs with robust phenotypes, we will then attempt to rescue a subset of these mutants in three ways: first, by inserting the whole deleted RNA; second, with a version of the RNA with the smORF(s) removed by the addition a stop codon; and lastly, using a micro- construct containing only the smORF and the endogenous promoter. We will generate direct evidence for translation using tagged expression analysis and targeted MS/MS to scan for predicted polypeptides in the whole embryo and tissue dissection samples. In addition to validating the existence of the predicted molecules, this dataset will provide a foundational gold standard for further development of tools for the computational prediction of functional micropeptides. These studies are directed toward the understanding of basic life processes and lay the foundation for promoting better human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE As a public resource, our studies will combine genome-scale phenotyping with detailed functional characterization that will assess the effects of evolutionary conserved small open reading frames (smORFs) on animal viability, development, fecundity, metabolism, longevity and behavior. We will apply state-of-the art methods in Ribosomal profiling, CRISPR genome engineering and targeted mass spectrometry together with the development of new computational tools and analyses to generate a foundational gold standard dataset for the study of smORFs and the prediction of functional smORFs in genome annotation. Many of the genes encoding these molecules have been found to play important roles in human diseases such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders and cancer.","Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs",9548692,R01HG009352,"['Adipose tissue', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Arthropods', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Collection', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Fertility', 'Foundations', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Ontology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminator Codon', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'adipokines', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'drug development', 'drug resource', 'embryo tissue', 'fly', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in situ imaging', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'man', 'mutant', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'polypeptide', 'promoter', 'ribosome profiling', 'sugar', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational genomics', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2018,1002519,0.016644056524708357
"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML No abstract available PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse. We propose to create new therapies for repressing AML based on targeting the epigenome, or the pattern of chemical modification of DNA and histones, the proteins that package and order DNA to promote gene expression.",Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML,9681931,F31CA228331,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Apoptosis', 'Arginine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Docking', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Embryonic Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Bone Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Myelogenous', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Network-based', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analog', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2018,49524,-0.015193339608605732
"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,9341016,R01GM104412,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cilia', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Frequency', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Knock-out', 'Left', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Situs Inversus', 'Structure', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Visceral', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'With laterality', 'Zebrafish', 'airway epithelium', 'cilium motility', 'congenital heart disorder', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'founder mutation', 'gene function', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research clinical testing', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,546200,0.020154614998417607
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9425727,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,464956,0.027487916304933642
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9251894,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Canes', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Encyclopedias', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,328031,0.03767554501988837
"Separating Wheat from Chaff in Major Depression Blood Biomarker Studies Project Summary Blood expression profiling of major depression disorder (MDD) patients has the potential to refine disease classification and diagnosis, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and improve drug targeting and clinical trial outcomes. However, the only significant finding in the largest MDD blood RNA study, a recent RNAseq profiling of 922 individuals comparing MDD patients with healthy controls, was a composite increase in the expression of genes associated with the interferon response pathway in MDD. Statistical analysis of such datasets is complicated by disease heterogeneity and by sources of inter-individual gene expression variation, such as high person-to-person differences in human blood cell type proportions, making it difficult to find measurements that robustly distinguish clinical groups. We have recently developed latent variable based computational approaches that more effectively model heterogeneity including blood proportions in blood gene expression data and that improve the identification of disease associated differentially expressed genes and disease-associated differences in cell type proportions. We have demonstrated that our methods increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes and improve agreement among separate studies of disease-associated global RNA expression. The latent variable framework we use can be exploited for interpreting the observed changes by attributing them to specific blood cell types. Preliminary analysis using these approaches on the large recent MDD RNAseq dataset finds evidence for additional depression related signatures and differentially expressed RNAs not detected by the original analysis. Analysis of the association of these signatures with acute symptoms and their stability over time in individuals suggests that they are most likely novel MDD trait markers. We will apply this enhanced methodology to identify novel MDD-associated genes in this large RNAseq dataset, confirm these signatures by analysis of other MDD public datasets, investigate the state/trait and genetic basis for these signatures and use machine learning to generate a purely clinical and biological data-driven classification of depression subgroups. This study is expected to result in an improved analysis framework for blood RNA biomarkers studies of psychiatric disease, significant new insight into MDD associated cell type proportion and blood gene expression trait signatures, and the identification of molecularly coherent depression subgroups. Project Narrative We have developed new computational methods that improve the ability to identify blood gene expression changes in genome-wide studies of blood in MDD. We will apply enhanced versions of these methods to investigate public MDD datasets.

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9459529,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,400000,0.013110703909161634
"Drosophila Functional Genomics Genome sequences contain the information needed for the development and function of a given species.  Exploring conservation of DNA sequence between species is a tool for identifying critical code that is likely to be important for functions shared between species.  Genomic information is deployed by transcription and differential expression may well be important for phenotypic distinctions among closely related species.  Comparative transcription has not been extensively explored. We are working on a genus-wide expression atlas of adult tissues and much of the raw data for this project have been deposited at GEO and the SRA for public consumption.  We have also begun a project to capture and reprocess all Drosophila data from public repositories world-wide, as well as defining the expression range for genes within a species.  These are valuable resources for our work and for the community in general.  How gene interact in networks is an important underpinning for understanding development, physiology, and disease.  We are looking at the transcriptional response to altered gene dose in aneuploid tissue culture cells, during X chromosome dosage compensation, and in a series of flies heterozygous for a tiling path of deletions (DrosDel).  We are mapping the coherent propagation of dosage effects elsewhere in the genome, and using the data to machine-learn network models to explain the observed patterns of gene expression.  The machine learning is progressing nicely and we are beginning to test predictions with additional expression profiles following directed perturbation by RNAi.  We continue to pilot the use of small compounds and FDA approved drugs, RNAi reagents, Crispr, and genetic background, as tools to perturb gene expression networks. These data are providing important validation of connectivity maps and will allow us to add directionality to network edges, as well as help us understand how different individuals respond to common external challenges.  DMRT transcription factors direct gonadal development in essentially all animals, but little is known about the gene networks they regulate. We are working on the function of the Drosophila DMRT (DSX) and are particularly interested in the identification of functional DSX transcription factor target genes.  We have previously used ChIP-Seq and DamID-Seq to determine the in vivo occupancy of DSX using tagged and native proteins in tissue culture cells and in Drosophila tissues and examined expression profiles in wild type and mutant conditions (especially those where we change the isoform of Dsx being expressed and measure the response over time) by RNA-Seq.  We are also performing knockdown experiments to test for the function of candidate DSX targets using RNAi (UAS-shRNAs driven by Dsx-Gal4 and other Gal4 lines).  We continue to work on selected potential DSX targets for detailed phenotypic follow-up to determine the function of these genes in the cells that are in direct contact with the germ line cells in the female and male gonads. We have also looked at the expression profiles of the potential DSX target genes that regulate elongation. n/a",Drosophila Functional Genomics,9549805,ZIADK015600,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Dose', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'FDA approved', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ Cells', 'Gonadal structure', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Stem cells', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'comparative', 'differential expression', 'dosage', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic information', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'literacy', 'male', 'mutant', 'network models', 'positional cloning', 'repository', 'response', 'small hairpin RNA', 'sperm cell', 'success', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,ZIA,2017,1507669,-0.0019198999654003461
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,9453342,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'drug development', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2017,2308193,0.006122183629917317
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9320692,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2017,552994,0.04096028814147634
"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders. Project Narrative It has long been known that there are many different kinds of neurons that are involved in controlling brain activity. However, it is unclear precisely how many different types of neurons exist, and to what degree human neurons resemble those of other animals. In this project we propose that by combining information about the gene activity in both human and mouse neurons we will begin to put together a final `parts list' of the nervous system which we can use to understand brain disorders.",Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species,9395464,F32MH114501,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'molecular pathology', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2017,59166,-0.011194395233338622
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identifynovelcellsubtypesthroughchangesintheexpressionrelationshipsbetweengenes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expressionprofilesislikelytobenefitfromavarietyofapproaches.Inordertofindagreementbetweenthose approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9398289,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,472477,0.026932247513124057
"Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the Data Generation Aim is to produce high quality data measuring phenotypes, protein and phosphoproteomics, and RNA expression in 30 cell lines grown on diverse microenvironments (ME). This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures.

"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9280975,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,397299,-0.018249874558070804
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9276155,R24OD020166,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operating System', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'mutant', 'nuclease', 'recombinase', 'repaired', 'site-specific integration', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'vector']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2017,706555,0.018306029084250296
"Retinal Circuit Development & Genetics a) Gene Expression profiling of Brn3AP RGCs and their brain targets by RNASeq (Sajgo et al, PNAS 2017) 	We have established an immunoaffinity purification strategy based on our Brn3CKOAP alleles. Using this strategy, we identified (i) genes enriched in RGCs compared to the retina, (ii) genes enriched in Brn3aAP vs Brn3bAP RGCs (presumed to convey the specific features distinguishing RGC cell types), and (iii) genes up- or downregulated by loss of Brn3a or Brn3b (potentially mediating the developmental programs that the Brn3s are thought to directly or indirectly regulate in RGCs).  About 3000 transcripts are enriched in RGCs when compared to the retina, and about 900 transcripts are found to be regulated by Brn3b and/or Brn3a.  We find that Brn3b loss affects RGCs significantly more than Brn3a loss. Moreover, the transcripts selectively expressed in RGCs, or affected by Brn3b loss are distinct for the different stages of development. A secondary situ hybridization validation screen was conducted on P3 eye sections, and find that more than half of the 233 targets are actually RGC specific.  A similar ratio was found for 265 genes that were confirmed by queries of the Allen Institute In Situ Hybridization atlas of E15 mouse embryos. We complemented these RGC profiles with RNAseq analysis of retinorecipient brain nuclei at P3, an age when RGC axons have reached the target and synapse formation is extremely active, and report our findings in the same study.  Amongst the many differentially expressed genes in our screen, we have focused on two classes of molecules:  (i) transcription factors, (ii) adhesion molecules/signaling receptors.  We find that, whereas about 60 % of all annotated transcription associated genes are expressed in RGCs, 322 genes are enriched in RGCs compared to retinas, and 95 are under Brn3 control.  These transcription factors, some of which had already been described, generate a wide combinatorial code demonstrating specificity for distinct RGC subpopulations.  Interestingly a much smaller number of adhesion molecules and guidance receptors are enriched in our RGC populations (about 200 transcripts).  To address the potential functions of molecules identified in our screen, we overexpressed a small subset (10 genes) in HEK293 cells, and find that several of them have the capacity to induce membrane processes reminiscent of neurites. It could therefore be that cell-autonomous mechanisms participate in determining neuronal arbor formation, that is then further refined and positioned by transmembrane receptors/adhesion molecules mediating cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions. This novel way of thinking about neuronal arbor formation will drive our research moving forward.  Using a Cre dependent, AAV-based overexpression approach to determine the subcellular localization of some of our targets in vivo in Brn3bCre RGCs, we find distributions consistent with roles in vesicle trafficking within neurites or at synapses.    Finally, out of a set of 79 genes proposed to be associated with Glaucoma in human genetics studies, only 12 appeared to be enriched in RGCs, potentially revealing molecular pathways associated with susceptibility to RGC damage. Thus, our RGC gene expression profiling project promises to be an extremely useful resource for the visual system field and in general for the neuroscience community.  c) Behavior Tests for visual function in mice (Kretschmer 2017, Wang 2017)  During animal locomotion or position adjustments, the visual system uses image stabilization reflexes to compensate for global shifts in the visual scene. These reflexes elicit compensatory head movements (optomotor response, OMR) in unrestrained animals or compensatory eye movements (optokinetic response, OKR) in head-fixed or unrestrained animals exposed to globally rotating striped patterns. We have used our newly developed software and apparatus to accurately quantitate mouse head movements during OMR, eye movements during OKR, and determine eye movements in freely behaving mice. We provided the first direct comparison of OMR and OKR gains (head or eye velocity/stimulus velocity) and found that the two reflexes have comparable dependencies on stimulus luminance, contrast, spatial frequency, and velocity. OMR and OKR are similarly affected in genetically modified mice with defects in RGCs compared with wild-type, suggesting they are driven by the same sensory input (RGC type). OKR eye movements have much higher gains than the OMR head movements, but neither can fully compensate global visual shifts. However, combined eye and head movements can be detected in unrestrained mice performing OMR, suggesting they can cooperate to achieve image stabilization, as previously described for other species. Our methodology has been successfully applied by us and multiple groups within the NEI, for the analysis of visual abilities in mice with genetic defects, and models for disease state and therapeutic intervention. The software and hardware we developed is now available as a commercial system, and we are implementing this system that will become part of the NEI Visual Function Core.   c) Multichannel electrophysiology for the analysis of Retinal Ganglion Cell Function  In this past year we have continued our development of a machine learning algorithm for the unsupervised detection and classification of RGC recordings from ex vivo retinas stimulated with a variety of visual stimuli. We had published a short report on a skeleton version of the algorithm, and have another manuscript for the full version under review. We have applied this approach to the analysis of response properties of intrinsically photosensitive RGCs that carried mutant versions of the photopigment Melanopsin in a collaborative project lead by Drs. P. Robinson and S. Hattar. This research, for which we additionally contributed AAV targeting vectors and behavior analysis apparatus and expertise, demonstrated that phosphorylation of the c terminal tail of Melanopsin plays a key role in the shut-off of the photopigment, and regulates the length of both ipRGC light reponses and Pupillary Light Reflex recovery times.   d) RGC-32 involvement in Th17 responses during experimentally induced autoimmune reactions.  While in Dr. Horea Russ lab at UMMS, I had cloned and characterized RGC-32, a vertebrate specific gene upregulated in proliferating tissues, regenerative context, and tumors.  Injured tissues react by inflammatory responses that attempt to clear the noxious influence, but at the same time repair the damage.  Somatic cells can be affected in a variety of ways by these signals.  One type of adaptive response is the induction of stress response genes, assumption of less mature tissue phenotypes, or even reactivation of cell cycle.  Dr. Rus and I conducted a screen for genes induced by complement system challenge in primary oligodendrocyte cell cultures.  We further characterized one of the identified genes, RGC-32, and showed that it interacts with cell cycle regulators, and can positively or negatively affect cell cycle activation in different contexts. More recently, I have collaborated with Dr. Rus to generate a knock-out for RGC-32, and members of his group discovered that RGC-32 plays a role in T lymphocytes, in particular in their differentiation towards the Th17 fate.  This in turn could affect the progression of experimentally induced auto-immune reactions (experimental autoimmune Encephalomyelitis, a murine model for multiple sclerosis). Thus RGC-32 could be a potential regulator of tissue repair or regeneration, especially in the context of inflammatory processes. n/a",Retinal Circuit Development & Genetics,9555695,ZIAEY000504,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'C-terminal', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Defect', 'Dendrites', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Embryo', 'Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Institutes', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Light', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Photosensitivity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Publishing', 'Pupil light reflex', 'Reaction', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'adhesion receptor', 'base', 'behavior test', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'complement system', 'differential expression', 'eye velocity', 'gene replacement', 'genetic manipulation', 'immunoreaction', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'luminance', 'melanopsin', 'member', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'negative affect', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'receptor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sensory input', 'software development', 'synaptogenesis', 'tissue regeneration', 'tissue repair', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor S-II', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,ZIA,2017,1811467,0.006669987710220485
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified

The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9398667,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,326862,-0.022772469410671833
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development.

"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9341310,R21ES027878,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Collection', 'Conceptus', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Placenta', 'Placental Biology', 'Placentation', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Procedures', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Syncytiotrophoblast', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Uterine cavity', 'Villous', 'age effect', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytotrophoblast', 'design', 'developmental toxicology', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personal care products', 'phthalates', 'postnatal', 'prospective', 'response', 'study population', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,191131,-0.03016764203178774
"Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs PROJECT SUMMARY Short peptides (10-100aa) are important regulators of physiology, development and metabolism, however their detection is difficult due to size and abundance. A stunning 30% of annotated human smORF genes include disease-associated variants mapped within exons, compared to 15% of human genes in general. Further, many smORFs are conserved across the entire metazoan phylogeny from invertebrates to vertebrates including man. These ultra-conserved functional smORF genes we call the Conserved smORF Catalog or CSC. These genes have been conserved across more than 500myr of evolution, and yet we know almost nothing at all about their functions. Due to a century of genetic analysis, the genome of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has the most complete functional annotation among metazoans. Functional annotations derived from Drosophila have been instrumental in hypothesis-based drug development for more than thirty years, and more recently have made possible the biological interpretation of hundreds of SNPs detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hence, functional annotations derived in fly for conserved genes are transferable to human and are of direct clinical relevance. Remarkably, less than 10% of smORFs in Drosophila have been studied functionally, or experimentally verified as generating peptides. A combination of genome engineering, computational, molecular, and functional studies will be used to systematically and comprehensively characterize the CSC, representing the first genome-scale characterization of smORFs in any organism providing a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly studied class of proteins. In total, we will characterize and functionally annotate ~400 conserved smORFs using CRISPR knockout followed by phenotyping and rescue assays. We will assess the phenotypes of the mutants, measuring viability, morphology, fecundity and fertility, lifespan, metabolism (sugar and lipid levels), and a number of behavioral phenotypes. For smORFs with robust phenotypes, we will then attempt to rescue a subset of these mutants in three ways: first, by inserting the whole deleted RNA; second, with a version of the RNA with the smORF(s) removed by the addition a stop codon; and lastly, using a micro- construct containing only the smORF and the endogenous promoter. We will generate direct evidence for translation using tagged expression analysis and targeted MS/MS to scan for predicted polypeptides in the whole embryo and tissue dissection samples. In addition to validating the existence of the predicted molecules, this dataset will provide a foundational gold standard for further development of tools for the computational prediction of functional micropeptides. These studies are directed toward the understanding of basic life processes and lay the foundation for promoting better human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE As a public resource, our studies will combine genome-scale phenotyping with detailed functional characterization that will assess the effects of evolutionary conserved small open reading frames (smORFs) on animal viability, development, fecundity, metabolism, longevity and behavior. We will apply state-of-the art methods in Ribosomal profiling, CRISPR genome engineering and targeted mass spectrometry together with the development of new computational tools and analyses to generate a foundational gold standard dataset for the study of smORFs and the prediction of functional smORFs in genome annotation. Many of the genes encoding these molecules have been found to play important roles in human diseases such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders and cancer.","Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs",9228843,R01HG009352,"['Adipose tissue', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Arthropods', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Collection', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Fertility', 'Foundations', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Ontology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminator Codon', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'adipokines', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'drug development', 'drug resource', 'embryo tissue', 'fly', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in situ imaging', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'man', 'mutant', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'polypeptide', 'promoter', 'ribosome profiling', 'sugar', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational genomics', 'virtual']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2017,1002725,0.016644056524708357
"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",9284482,K23ES023700,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Bronchi', 'Byssinosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Closed Cohort Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Critical Care', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endotoxins', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gossypium', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Silk', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'airway epithelium', 'asthmatic', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'bronchial epithelium', 'career', 'career development', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'data mining', 'differential expression', 'disorder subtype', 'elementary school', 'environmental endotoxin', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory lung disease', 'inner city', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'symposium', 'transcriptome']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2017,152840,0.0032741001967337155
"Bioinformatics and Analysis of Genomics High Throughput Data Gene expression measurement using microarrays or next-generation sequencing techniques, is a popular and useful technology for genomic analysis. Challenging problems result from the large volume of data generated in these experiments. Quality control and experimental design remain important fundamental issues. Analytical techniques which account for complex experimental designs and minimizing artifacts are required.    Bioinformaticians are required to be able to handle large scale data projects while also being to process data into a format where statistical procedures can be applied.  There are different statistical and bioinformatics issues that remain and this project attempts to address some of these.  Next generation sequencing techniques are now a popular means for RNA expression measurement (RNAseq). As with microarrays, a host of technical and quality control issues remain as challenges, in addition to the new statistical problems implied by change of scale from continuous (microarray fluorescence) to discrete (read counts).  Affordable, high-quality software availability has been one of the bottlenecks in analysis of microarray data. We have further developed the ""MSCL Analyst's Toolbox"" written in the JMP software package to address this need.  This toolbox allows investigators to download Affymetrix microarray data from a central database, normalize and transform the data, inspect it for a variety of outliers or defects, perform a variety of statistical tests to select relevant genes affected in the experiment, and then visualize and classify various patterns of gene expression. In collaboration with over forty investigators in NCI, CC, NHLBI, NINDS, NIAID, NHGRI, NICHD, NIA, NIDDK, NIDA , this tool has been applied to dozens of microarray studies. The Analyst's Toolbox has been extended to now handle analysis of RNAseq and metagenomics microbiome data.  In addition, the capability to link data from the user's workstation to online databases has been a nice feature that has been recently added to the Toolbox.  In a collaboration with NHGRI and NHLBI, we are conducting an investigation of transcriptomic differences using a case-control design of coronary artery calcification, based on ClinSeq study samples. We are studying a select number of genes using NanoString technology and are currently working on an analysis that takes over 100 clinical parameters into account.  That same experiment has been extended to a possible novel transcript finding in coronary artery calcification patients.  This finding is being further researched within our lab and the NHGRI. An analytical pipeline was developed and published in Plos One in February 2016 utilizing 16s rRNA sequencing data from the Ion Metagenomics Kit (Life Technologies).  This publication analyzed and evaluated the results from four different mock samples from BEI Laboratories.  The results of this work will be used in other collaborations with the NIAAA and the Clinical Center Nursing Department.   In a collaboration with the Clinical Center Nursing Department, we are in the process of finalizing the analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients.  This is a longitudinal study where samples were collected at baseline, three months after treatment and 6 months after treatment.  The study had an enrollment N of 24 patients.  Because patient antibiotic use could be a major confounding factor in studying the microbiome of patients, we are in the process of analyzing and correlating patient antibiotic use with their overall diversity changes at different time points.  Considering that patients were very ill and were prescribed many different antibiotics, this analysis will be crucial in data interpretation.    In addition to the above collaboration with the Clinical Center, a collaboration with NIAAA studying the oral and gut microbiome changes during the alcoholic detoxification process in underway.  The pipeline published in February 2016 will be used to analyze this data generated from the 16s Ion Metagenomics Kit (Life Technologies).  Libraries from this kit include amplicons that target 7 hypervariable regions of the 16s gene.  The study has almost complete enrollment and DNA extraction has begun for almost all gut samples.  Two samples have been sequenced in a pilot thus far.  The analysis of that data has shown that the data collection method and bioinformatics processing has proven to yield many gut bacteria.  A manuscript is in preparation for this study documenting the novel gut sampling used for this project.  In an effort to avoid sampling bias, whole stool homogenization was used for data collection for this project.    In a different collaboration with the NIAAA, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) are being investigated in an attempt to discover important variables associated with Treatment (Tx) and non-Treatment (Non-Tx) seeking individuals.  This patient cohort has over 200 variables collected for each patient covering drug, alcohol and smoking use, clinical diagnostics, personal characteristics, family history, psychological, emotional and social traits.  Using Alternative Decision Tree Analysis from a classification software tool, Weka Tool (Frank E 2016), a subset of important variables predicting Tx and non-Tx with roughly about 85% or more accuracy were found.  The goal of this work is to devise a patient-specific treatment plan based on whether a patient seeks treatment or does not.  Being able to reduce the number of highly predictive variables will greatly improve patient classification for applied treatment plans and will be an important contribution to the field of mental health and drug abuse disorders. n/a",Bioinformatics and Analysis of Genomics High Throughput Data,9549713,ZIACT000277,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Antibiotics', 'Aplastic Anemia', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Defect', 'Detoxification Process', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Manuscripts', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'RNA analysis', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Sampling Studies', 'Smoking', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'gut microbiome', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nano-string', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oral microbiome', 'problem drinker', 'psychologic', 'social', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIA,2017,201522,-0.0022727143342437836
"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,9118227,R01GM104412,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cilia', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Frequency', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Knock-out', 'Left', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Situs Inversus', 'Structure', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Visceral', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'With laterality', 'Zebrafish', 'airway epithelium', 'cilium motility', 'congenital heart disorder', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'founder mutation', 'gene function', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,653850,0.020154614998417607
"Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. The RNAi technique is widely used in both biological research and clinical applications because it has the ability to knockdown essentially any gene of interest. However, one major unresolved issue in RNAi studies is non-specific gene silencing. It is well known that, in addition to the single intended gene target, many unintended targets are also simultaneously silenced. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for improving RNAi specificity. RNAi specificity and potency are determined by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the silencing complex. We propose the hypothesis that gene silencing specificity can be significantly improved with rational siRNA design. We have previously developed a machine learning algorithm for the design of widely-distributed commercial siRNAs. Based on this commercial success, we propose to further develop a new method for genome-wide design of next-generation siRNAs with significantly reduced off-target effects. The new design method will lay a solid foundation for further commercial development of siRNA products that can be used in a variety of RNAi-based applications.

"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9042426,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data mining', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'drug mechanism', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,328232,0.03767554501988837
"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules. We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing. We will also develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features from RNA-seq experiments.

"Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A holy grail of bioinformatics is the creation of whole-cell models with the ability to enhance human understanding and facilitate discovery. To this end, a successful and widely-used effort is the Gene Ontology (GO), a massive project to manually annotate genes into terms describing molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components and provide relationships between terms, e.g. capturing that ""small ribosomal subunit"" and ""large ribosomal subunit"" come together to make ""ribosome"". GO is widely used to understand the function of a gene or group of genes. Unfortunately, GO is limited by the effort required to create and update it by hand. It exists only for well-studied organisms and even then in only one, generic form per organism with limited overall genome coverage and a bias towards well-studied genes and functions. It is not possible to learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using GO, and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism, let alone a specific cell-type or disease-state.  This proposed research will change this state of affairs. Already, work has shown that large networks of gene and protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used to computationally infer an ontology whose coverage and power are equivalent to those of the manually-curated GO Cellular Component ontology. Still, this first attempt was limited in the types of experimental data used and its ability to infer the more generally useful Biological Process ontology. Here machine learning approaches will be applied to integrate many types of experimental data into ontology model construction and analyze the type of biological information provided by each experiment, revealing those experiments most informative for capturing Biological Process information. Furthermore, the high-throughput experimental data to ontology paradigm explored here will be used to develop a computational tool to highlight novel types of hypotheses that are inaccessible by current high-throughput experimental data analysis methods.  Preliminary work has shown GO to be useful for prediction of synthetic lethal pairs of genes, i.e. genes that are individually non-essential but when knocked out together cause cell death. Given the high mutation rate in cancer, these pairs provide potential cancer drug targets, as a drug may target a gene product which is now essential in the mutated cancer cells but not other cells, thereby killing only cancer cells. Because data-driven ontologies are not as hindered by issues with bias and coverage and are specifically designed to capture only functional relationships, this proposal will explore the idea that data-driven ontologies will be better suited to help predict synthetic lethal pairs than GO. To this end, algorithms will be developed to construct a data-driven ontology of yeast DNA repair and use this ontology to predict synthetic lethal pairs of genes.  Overall, this proposal will develop the computational and experimental roadmap to construct a whole-cell model of gene function - an ontology - and use the model to discover useful biology - synthetic lethal pairs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, a new framework for using the results of commonly performed, genome-wide experiments has the potential to create whole-cell models of gene function, similar to the widely-used Gene Ontology, directly from data without manual intervention. This will allow creation of useful models of cells from different organisms, tissues and diseases which researchers can use to discover the function of unstudied genes and to uncover new functions performed by the cell. Furthermore, this proposal will use these models for the discovery of new cancer drug targets called synthetic lethal pairs of genes.            ",Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis,9145523,F30HG007618,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Processed Genes', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological information processing', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental analysis', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'gene product', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel anticancer drug', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2016,48576,0.0009648008315275653
"Separating Wheat from Chaff in Major Depression Blood Biomarker Studies Project Summary Blood expression profiling of major depression disorder (MDD) patients has the potential to refine disease classification and diagnosis, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and improve drug targeting and clinical trial outcomes. However, the only significant finding in the largest MDD blood RNA study, a recent RNAseq profiling of 922 individuals comparing MDD patients with healthy controls, was a composite increase in the expression of genes associated with the interferon response pathway in MDD. Statistical analysis of such datasets is complicated by disease heterogeneity and by sources of inter-individual gene expression variation, such as high person-to-person differences in human blood cell type proportions, making it difficult to find measurements that robustly distinguish clinical groups. We have recently developed latent variable based computational approaches that more effectively model heterogeneity including blood proportions in blood gene expression data and that improve the identification of disease associated differentially expressed genes and disease-associated differences in cell type proportions. We have demonstrated that our methods increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes and improve agreement among separate studies of disease-associated global RNA expression. The latent variable framework we use can be exploited for interpreting the observed changes by attributing them to specific blood cell types. Preliminary analysis using these approaches on the large recent MDD RNAseq dataset finds evidence for additional depression related signatures and differentially expressed RNAs not detected by the original analysis. Analysis of the association of these signatures with acute symptoms and their stability over time in individuals suggests that they are most likely novel MDD trait markers. We will apply this enhanced methodology to identify novel MDD-associated genes in this large RNAseq dataset, confirm these signatures by analysis of other MDD public datasets, investigate the state/trait and genetic basis for these signatures and use machine learning to generate a purely clinical and biological data-driven classification of depression subgroups. This study is expected to result in an improved analysis framework for blood RNA biomarkers studies of psychiatric disease, significant new insight into MDD associated cell type proportion and blood gene expression trait signatures, and the identification of molecularly coherent depression subgroups. Project Narrative We have developed new computational methods that improve the ability to identify blood gene expression changes in genome-wide studies of blood in MDD. We will apply enhanced versions of these methods to investigate public MDD datasets.

"A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial (CF) abnormalities constitute more than a third of all human structural birth defects. To define their genetic etiology, detailed molecular understanding is required of coordinated movement and fusion of embryonic facial prominences - as disruption of these morphogenetic events cause defects such as orofacial clefts (OFC). The NIH FaceBase initiative is an important step to address this need, as it aims to generate comprehensive whole-genome expression datasets using microarrays or Next-Gen RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on mouse embryonic CF tissue. However, genome-wide profiling identifies several thousand ""expressed"" genes and it is a formidable challenge to predict and prioritize the select few genes that are critical to tissue development or pathogenesis. We posit that although there is a wealth of genomic-level data available, this deficit remains because an adequate strategy has not yet been applied to identify these important candidate CF genes. We recently developed an innovative approach - termed in silico whole embryo body (WB) subtraction - to identify such important genes based on developmentally-enriched expression. We have applied this novel approach to ~15% of FaceBase data and assembled this knowledge as a user-friendly web-based interactive tool SysFACE (Systems tool for craniofacial expression-based gene discovery, http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Research/SysFACE). Even with limited datasets, the beta version of SysFACE is significantly more effective, compared with unprocessed FaceBase datasets, in identification of known genes associated with OFCs from both linkage and GWAS studies. To process all existing FaceBase datasets, we will generate additional platform-specific WB reference datasets and evaluate these further with machine learning strategies to identify genes important to CF development (Aim 1). Subsequently, we aim to experimentally validate these tissue-enriched gene expression profiles, and to assemble this knowledge - along with a new evidence-based functional gene regulatory network (GRN) that will allow all molecular data from the CF published literature to be represented on systems level - as a user-friendly web-based interactive resource (Aim 2), which will also be made available through FaceBase. Development of SysFACE, as outlined in this application, will greatly improve prediction of candidate CF genes, provide an excellent resource for CF-network construction, and will facilitate CF gene discovery efforts by developmental biologists and clinicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Craniofacial malformations are common among structural birth defects among which orofacial clefts alone occur in 1/800 live-births and carry a lifetime cost for medical treatment, rehabilitation services and lost productivity of more than $100,000 per affected person. This application seeks to analyze FaceBase gene expression data using an integrated approach to develop a web-based user-friendly tool SysFACE - for both clinicians and scientists - that predicts and prioritizes craniofacial genes. SysFACE, available through FaceBase, will accelerate craniofacial disease gene discovery, which in turn will facilitate identification of new therapeutic approaches.",A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool,9107846,R03DE024776,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye Development', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Online Systems', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'System', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'data mining', 'evidence base', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'life time cost', 'microdeletion', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'orofacial cleft', 'rehabilitation service', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'web based interface', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R03,2016,192500,0.025569375119494576
"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr. Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr. Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr. John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.     During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies.     The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project. Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.        ","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9070289,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2016,377807,0.04096028814147634
"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity. Astonishingly, as much as 80% of human DNA is transcribed into RNA as recently reported by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. New classes of RNA are being identified including many which are non-protein coding (ncRNA). Nonetheless ncRNAs are involved in regulating cellular activity. Deciphering the structure-function relationship of these RNAs is of immediate importance as ncRNAs have now been implicated in a variety of diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1, prostate cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease-like 2. Traditional approaches to determine high-resolution RNA 3D structures have proven to be prohibitively time consuming and expensive. Nymirum has developed an Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System that is faster, cheaper, and more robust than current approaches. This System will be commercialized for use by the drug industry and academic researchers in their quest to understand and treat human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA 3D structure and function information is critical to understanding basic cell function, delineating dysfunctional RNA contribution to human disease, and finding new drugs to treat diseases caused by dysfunctional RNAs.

"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9066171,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'empowered', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'promoter', 'research study', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,397299,-0.018249874558070804

"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9151409,R24OD020166,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operating System', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cost', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'mutant', 'nuclease', 'protein expression', 'recombinase', 'repaired', 'research study', 'site-specific integration', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'vector']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2016,759853,0.018306029084250296
"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,8998053,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'DRADA2b protein', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'MYH11 gene', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'calponin', 'dsRNA adenosine deaminase', 'gain of function', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2016,375000,0.026825412850320623
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Drosophila Functional Genomics Genome sequences contain the information needed for the development and function of a given species.  Exploring conservation of DNA sequence between species is a tool for identifying critical code that is likely to be important for functions shared between species.  Genomic information is deployed by transcription and differential expression may well be important for phenotypic distinctions among closely related species.  Comparative transcription has not been extensively explored. We completed and published deep sequencing experiments (RNA-Seq) to probe expression in several of the newly sequenced Drosophila species.  These expression data provided strong functional validation of the Drosophila melanogaster annotation, and demonstrated methods to validate gene models in other species, including humans.  The information content of the genome is increased by alternative processing of primary transcripts.  Genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing is prone to errors.  We have undertaken computational efforts to improve the methodology in this arena.  We have begun to explore how various genes regulate splicing.  How gene interact in networks is an important underpinning for understanding development, physiology, and disease.  We are looking at the transcriptional response to altered gene dose in aneuploid tissue culture cells, during X chromosome dosage compensation, and in a series of flies heterozygous for a tiling path of deletions (DrosDel).  The DrosDel work is being expanded in terms of breadth of genome coverage and by the addition of tissues.  We are mapping the coherent propagation of dosage effects elsewhere in the genome, and using the data to machine-learn network models to explain the observed patterns of gene expression.  We continue to pilot the use of small compounds and FDA approved drugs, RNAi reagents, Crispr, and genetic background, as tools to perturb gene expression networks. These data are providing important validation of connectivity maps and will allow us to add directionality to network edges, as well as help us understand how different individuals respond to common external challenges.  DMRT transcription factors direct gonadal development in essentially all animals, but little is known about the gene networks they regulate. We are working on the function of the Drosophila DMRT (DSX) and are particularly interested in the identification of functional DSX transcription factor target genes.  We have previously used ChIP-Seq and DamID-Seq to determine the in vivo occupancy of DSX using tagged and native proteins in tissue culture cells and in Drosophila tissues and examined expression profiles in wild type and mutant conditions (especially those where we change the isoform of Dsx being expressed and measure the response over time) by RNA-Seq.  We are also performing knockdown experiments to test for the function of candidate DSX targets using RNAi (UAS-shRNAs driven by Dsx-Gal4 and other Gal4 lines).  Finally, we are asking if these target genes show dominant genetic interactions with mutant Dsx alleles.  We have selected potential DSX targets skull, small ovaries, and broad for detailed phenotypic follow-up to determine the function of these genes in the cells that are in direct contact with the germ line cells in the female and male gonads. n/a",Drosophila Functional Genomics,9356052,ZIADK015600,"['Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dominant Genetic Conditions', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Dose', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Elements', 'FDA approved', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ Cells', 'Gonadal structure', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Ovary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Series', 'Stem cells', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'comparative', 'cranium', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'dosage', 'fly', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human disease', 'human genome sequencing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'learning network', 'literacy', 'male', 'mutant', 'network models', 'positional cloning', 'research study', 'response', 'success', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,ZIA,2016,1639222,-0.009889693036741035
"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9197555,R21ES027878,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Collection', 'Conceptus', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Procedures', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Syncytiotrophoblast', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Uterine cavity', 'Villous', 'abstracting', 'age effect', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytotrophoblast', 'design', 'developmental toxicology', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personal care products', 'phthalates', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'response', 'study population', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2016,245727,-0.03016764203178774

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain. Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.",Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain,8997123,R01NS075449,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Angelman Syndrome', 'Antibodies', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Behavioral', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'ES Cell Line', 'Elements', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Expression Library', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Future', 'Genomic approach', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger, Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'crosslink', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lentiviral-mediated', 'messenger ribonucleoprotein', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'relating to nervous system', 'ribosome profiling', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,599873,0.03449478166755755
"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",9066670,K23ES023700,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Bronchi', 'Burn injury', 'Byssinosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Closed Cohort Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Critical Care', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endotoxins', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gossypium', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Silk', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway epithelium', 'asthmatic', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'bronchial epithelium', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'data mining', 'differential expression', 'disorder subtype', 'elementary school', 'environmental endotoxin', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory lung disease', 'inner city', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'symposium', 'transcriptome', 'trend']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2016,152840,0.0032741001967337155
"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX.

"Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. The RNAi technique is widely used in both biological research and clinical applications because it has the ability to knockdown essentially any gene of interest.

"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,8798024,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'cancer genome', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug mechanism', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,343551,0.03689844705036549
"Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A holy grail of bioinformatics is the creation of whole-cell models with the ability to enhance human understanding and facilitate discovery. To this end, a successful and widely-used effort is the Gene Ontology (GO), a massive project to manually annotate genes into terms describing molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components and provide relationships between terms, e.g. capturing that ""small ribosomal subunit"" and ""large ribosomal subunit"" come together to make ""ribosome"". GO is widely used to understand the function of a gene or group of genes. Unfortunately, GO is limited by the effort required to create and update it by hand. It exists only for well-studied organisms and even then in only one, generic form per organism with limited overall genome coverage and a bias towards well-studied genes and functions. It is not possible to learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using GO, and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism, let alone a specific cell-type or disease-state.  This proposed research will change this state of affairs. Already, work has shown that large networks of gene and protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used to computationally infer an ontology whose coverage and power are equivalent to those of the manually-curated GO Cellular Component ontology. Still, this first attempt was limited in the types of experimental data used and its ability to infer the more generally useful Biological Process ontology. Here machine learning approaches will be applied to integrate many types of experimental data into ontology model construction and analyze the type of biological information provided by each experiment, revealing those experiments most informative for capturing Biological Process information. Furthermore, the high-throughput experimental data to ontology paradigm explored here will be used to develop a computational tool to highlight novel types of hypotheses that are inaccessible by current high-throughput experimental data analysis methods.  Preliminary work has shown GO to be useful for prediction of synthetic lethal pairs of genes, i.e. genes that are individually non-essential but when knocked out together cause cell death. Given the high mutation rate in cancer, these pairs provide potential cancer drug targets, as a drug may target a gene product which is now essential in the mutated cancer cells but not other cells, thereby killing only cancer cells. Because data-driven ontologies are not as hindered by issues with bias and coverage and are specifically designed to capture only functional relationships, this proposal will explore the idea that data-driven ontologies will be better suited to help predict synthetic lethal pairs than GO. To this end, algorithms will be developed to construct a data-driven ontology of yeast DNA repair and use this ontology to predict synthetic lethal pairs of genes.  Overall, this proposal will develop the computational and experimental roadmap to construct a whole-cell model of gene function - an ontology - and use the model to discover useful biology - synthetic lethal pairs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, a new framework for using the results of commonly performed, genome-wide experiments has the potential to create whole-cell models of gene function, similar to the widely-used Gene Ontology, directly from data without manual intervention. This will allow creation of useful models of cells from different organisms, tissues and diseases which researchers can use to discover the function of unstudied genes and to uncover new functions performed by the cell. Furthermore, this proposal will use these models for the discovery of new cancer drug targets called synthetic lethal pairs of genes.            ",Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis,8951600,F30HG007618,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Processed Genes', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological information processing', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental analysis', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2015,39304,0.0009648008315275653
"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells. The efficacy and biocompatibility (toxicity) of polymers and combination treatments will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo (in mice).",Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods,8786566,R01GM093229,"['Affinity', 'Amines', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Apoptosis', 'Biocompatible', 'Biodistribution', 'Cells', 'Combinatorial Synthesis', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA delivery', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Ethers', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transduction Agent', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Viral Vector', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids', 'Polyamines', 'Polymers', 'Property', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'SCID Mice', 'Structure', 'TNFSF10 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Viral Vector', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'bone', 'cancer cell', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene therapy', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'luminescence', 'milligram', 'model design', 'monomer', 'multitask', 'nanoparticle', 'non-viral gene delivery', 'novel', 'prostate cancer cell', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'trafficking', 'transgene expression', 'vector', 'zeta potential']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2015,289337,0.01962995964812843
"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules. We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing. We will also develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features from RNA-seq experiments.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases. Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases.

"A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial (CF) abnormalities constitute more than a third of all human structural birth defects. To define their genetic etiology, detailed molecular understanding is required of coordinated movement and fusion of embryonic facial prominences - as disruption of these morphogenetic events cause defects such as orofacial clefts (OFC). The NIH FaceBase initiative is an important step to address this need, as it aims to generate comprehensive whole-genome expression datasets using microarrays or Next-Gen RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on mouse embryonic CF tissue. However, genome-wide profiling identifies several thousand ""expressed"" genes and it is a formidable challenge to predict and prioritize the select few genes that are critical to tissue development or pathogenesis. We posit that although there is a wealth of genomic-level data available, this deficit remains because an adequate strategy has not yet been applied to identify these important candidate CF genes. We recently developed an innovative approach - termed in silico whole embryo body (WB) subtraction - to identify such important genes based on developmentally-enriched expression. We have applied this novel approach to ~15% of FaceBase data and assembled this knowledge as a user-friendly web-based interactive tool SysFACE (Systems tool for craniofacial expression-based gene discovery, http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Research/SysFACE). Even with limited datasets, the beta version of SysFACE is significantly more effective, compared with unprocessed FaceBase datasets, in identification of known genes associated with OFCs from both linkage and GWAS studies. To process all existing FaceBase datasets, we will generate additional platform-specific WB reference datasets and evaluate these further with machine learning strategies to identify genes important to CF development (Aim 1). Subsequently, we aim to experimentally validate these tissue-enriched gene expression profiles, and to assemble this knowledge - along with a new evidence-based functional gene regulatory network (GRN) that will allow all molecular data from the CF published literature to be represented on systems level - as a user-friendly web-based interactive resource (Aim 2), which will also be made available through FaceBase. Development of SysFACE, as outlined in this application, will greatly improve prediction of candidate CF genes, provide an excellent resource for CF-network construction, and will facilitate CF gene discovery efforts by developmental biologists and clinicians.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Craniofacial malformations are common among structural birth defects among which orofacial clefts alone occur in 1/800 live-births and carry a lifetime cost for medical treatment, rehabilitation services and lost productivity of more than $100,000 per affected person. This application seeks to analyze FaceBase gene expression data using an integrated approach to develop a web-based user-friendly tool SysFACE - for both clinicians and scientists - that predicts and prioritizes craniofacial genes.

Forkhead (Fkh) TFs constitute one such family of regulators, with at least four Fkh TFs known to be required for proper cardiac development in mammals and three Fkh genes  which when mutated are associated with human congenital heart defects.  Our prior work demonstrated that two Drosophila Fkh genes, jumeau (jumu) and Checkpoint suppressor homologue (CHES-1-like), determine cardiac cell fates, number and position by regulating a Polo-kinase pathway to mediate three distinct categories of cardiac progenitor cell divisions.  Additionally, synergistic genetic interactions showed that Myb, identified in the machine learning approach described in Project 1, functions in concert with both Jumu and CHES-1-like TFs to regulate two of the three types of Polo-dependent cardiac progenitor cell divisions.  Our genetic studies further revealed that the two Fkh genes also act in a partially redundant manner to regulate other, Polo-independent aspects of cardiogenesis.  Finally, we found that Fkh TF binding sites were significantly enriched in combination with those of other known cardiogenic TFs in the enhancers of genes that are expressed in the heart.  Collectively, these results suggested that these two Fkh TFs mediate multiple cardiogenic processes by regulating a large number of downstream effector genes. 	 In order to identify these Fkh target genes and the distinct cardiogenic processes in which they are involved, we utilized both microarrays and RNA-seq to perform genome-wide gene expression profiling of flow cytometry-sorted cardiac mesodermal cells from wild-type embryos as well as from jumu and CHES-1-like gain- and loss-of-function embryos, including the double mutants.  An analysis of these expression profiling results identified putative Fkh target genes based on significant enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) attributes that are consistent with involvement in numerous cardiogenic processes, including those as diverse as the initial specification of the cardiac mesoderm, establishment of the heart lumen, proper positioning of different heart cell types, sarcomere and myofibril formation, assembly of mitochondrial subunits and processes, and cardiac progenitor cell divisions.    We also have been conducting genetic and RNAi-based functional investigations of these putative Fkh target genes in the heart in order to reveal the molecular basis of their cardiogenic activities. We initially showed that CHES-1-like and jumu play a mutually redundant role in specifying the cardiac mesoderm since eliminating the functions of both Fkh genes in the same embryo results in defective hearts with missing hemisegments.  Subsequent experiments involving putative Fkh target genes identified by expression profiling demonstrated that this process is mediated at the molecular level at least in part by the Fkh TFs regulating the fibroblast growth factor receptor Heartless (Htl) and the Wnt receptor Frizzled (Fz), with both of these signaling pathways known from previous studies to function in cardiac progenitor specification.  In further support of this regulatory model, CHES-1-like and jumu exhibit synergistic genetic interactions with htl and fz in cardiac mesoderm specification.  These findings imply that the Forkhead TFs and the identified signaling receptors function through the same genetic pathways such that this class of TFs transcriptionally activates the expression of both receptor-encoding genes.  Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of either htl or fz in the entire mesoderm partially rescues the defective cardiac mesoderm specification phenotype seen in embryos doubly homozygous for mutations in jumu and CHES-1-like.  When targeted exclusively to the cardiac mesoderm using even more restrictive Gal4 drivers to mediate Fkh gene RNAi, we were able to show that the cardiogenic functions of both CHES-1-like and jumu are autonomous to cells comprising the heart-forming region of the embryo.  Taken together, these data demonstrate that functional redundancy of the Forkhead TFs leads to robustness in the specification of cardiac progenitors at least in part by regulating the expression of two well-known cardiogenic signaling pathway receptors.  Collectively, these studies are elucidating the molecular pathways used in multiple Fkh-mediated cardiogenic pathways, and are revealing how these cardiac subnetworks are orchestrated by a finite set of TFs. n/a",Functional studies of individual transcription factors in mesoderm development,9157447,ZIAHL006164,"['Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac development', 'Categories', 'Cell division', 'Cells', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila polo protein', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Mesoderm', 'Mesoderm Cell', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Myofibrils', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Sarcomeres', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stem cells', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cell type', 'forkhead protein', 'genome-wide', 'heart cell', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'overexpression', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'receptor function', 'research study', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",ZIA,2015,589199,-0.005466936571301539

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient. The information we learn may eventually lead to a more personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of COPD patients.            ",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE,8965166,R01HL125583,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Malignant', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spirometry', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transcript', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,911563,0.02094725632177534
"Developing integrative approaches for identifying disease-causing genes and dysfunctional networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Cancer is a consequence of the accumulation of genetic alterations. Large whole-genome scale resequencing projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have been launched in an effort to comprehensively catalog the genomic mutations and epigenetic modifications that are associated with cancer. It is essential to identify cancer-causing genes and pathways to gain insight into the disease mechanisms and hence facilitate early diagnosis and optimal treatment. However, identifying cancer-causing genes and their functional pathways remains challenging due to the complex biological interactions and the heterogeneity of diseases. Genetic mutations in disease-causing genes can disturb signaling pathways that impact the expression of a set of genes performing certain biological functions. We refer to a set of such genes as a functional module. We hypothesize that driver mutations, that is, mutations that lead to cancer progression, are likely to affect common disease-associated functional modules, and the causal relationship between the mutations and the perturbed signals of the modules can be reconstructed from gene expression data and protein interaction data. In this project, we will develop a novel approach to infer disease-causing genes and networks by integrating information from multiple types of data including genomic variations, gene expression and protein interactions. We first dynamically identify disease-associated modules that consist of a set of interacting genes, then develop a Bayesian-based approach to infer causative genes from the disease-associated modules. Then, by developing a stochastic search based method, we can determine the paths connecting causative genes and gene modules. As a result, disease- related pathways are inferred from the paths. Furthermore, we will integrate those pathways with the human interactome to discover higher-level disease-associated networks. In addition, we will develop machine learning based classifiers to predict disease types and clinical outcomes utilizing the molecular signatures identified in this project, such as differentially expressed gene modules and causative genes. Our computational framework and classifiers will be made available to the research community via a webserver. The PI serves as the university bioinformatics program director and has extensive teaching and research experience. A goal of this project is also to provide scientific research training to students and o help students to gain biological insight through their involvement with the project. Students will learn practical scientific computing skills from the PI and develop their own computational approaches to solving specific biomedical problems under the guidance of the PI. Thus the project will serve as an effective learning-research model in bioinformatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop and implement a novel framework to identify causative mutations and pathways and study cancer disease mechanisms by reconstructing signaling pathways. This will help to advance personalized medicine and lead to a greater understanding of cancer mechanisms, which can lay the foundation for improving early diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as the discovery of new therapeutic targets.            ",Developing integrative approaches for identifying disease-causing genes and dysfunctional networks,8880075,R15GM114739,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Universities', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer framework', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'prospective', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'scientific computing', 'skills', 'treatment planning', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT LITTLE ROCK,R15,2015,373520,0.019243018516159976
"ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.            ",ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER,8888066,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'empowered', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,397299,-0.018578404059472736
"Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the Data Generation Aim is to produce high quality data measuring phenotypes, protein and phosphoproteomics, and RNA expression in 30 cell lines grown on diverse microenvironments (ME). This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures.

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity. Astonishingly, as much as 80% of human DNA is transcribed into RNA as recently reported by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. New classes of RNA are being identified including many which are non-protein coding (ncRNA). Nonetheless ncRNAs are involved in regulating cellular activity. Deciphering the structure-function relationship of these RNAs is of immediate importance as ncRNAs have now been implicated in a variety of diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1, prostate cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease-like 2. Traditional approaches to determine high-resolution RNA 3D structures have proven to be prohibitively time consuming and expensive. Nymirum has developed an Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System that is faster, cheaper, and more robust than current approaches.

"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,8794466,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'DRADA2b protein', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Smooth Muscle Myosins', 'Steno', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'calponin', 'dsRNA adenosine deaminase', 'gain of function', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2015,368349,0.026825412850320623

"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",8852128,K23ES023700,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Bronchi', 'Burn injury', 'Byssinosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Closed Cohort Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Critical Care', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endotoxins', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gossypium', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Silk', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway epithelium', 'asthmatic', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'bronchial epithelium', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'data mining', 'differential expression', 'disorder subtype', 'elementary school', 'environmental endotoxin', 'experience', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory lung disease', 'inner city', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'symposium', 'trend']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2015,152840,0.0032741001967337155
"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain. Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.",Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain,8790775,R01NS075449,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Angelman Syndrome', 'Antibodies', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Behavioral', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'ES Cell Line', 'Elements', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Expression Library', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Future', 'Genomic approach', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger, Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'crosslink', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human RBM5 protein', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lentiviral-mediated', 'messenger ribonucleoprotein', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'relating to nervous system', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,599873,0.03449478166755755
"Informatics Platform for Mammalian Gene Regulation at Isoform-level DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated. The novel bioinformatics methods developed by this project will help in silico discovery and research for accelerating the linkage of phenotypic and genomic information, at gene-isoform level. Public health relevance statement:  The disruption of numerous human genes and their isoforms driven by alternative splicing and alternative transcription is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. The development of bioinformatics methods and user-friendly  software in this study will provide useful tools to better understand gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, and more importantly, how dis-regulation of these mechanisms leads to a variety of diseases.",Informatics Platform for Mammalian Gene Regulation at Isoform-level,8843951,R01LM011297,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Fertility', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'TP53 gene', 'TP73 gene', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Trees', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer initiation', 'cost', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuropsychiatry', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web-accessible']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,337196,-0.026362479174010918
"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability.

"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.                ",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,8623176,R01GM104412,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cilia', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Knock-out', 'Left', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Situs Inversus', 'Structure', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Visceral', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'With laterality', 'Zebrafish', 'airway epithelium', 'cilium motility', 'congenital heart disorder', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'founder mutation', 'gene function', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,573774,0.020154614998417607
"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MicroRNAs are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single microRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict microRNA gene targets by developing and testing a new computational microRNA target prediction model. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by microRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Functional studies of individual transcription factors in mesoderm development Cardiogenesis involves multiple biological processes acting in concert during development, coordination which is achieved via the regulation of diverse cardiac genes by a finite set of transcription factors (TFs).  Forkhead (Fkh) TFs constitute one such family of regulators, with at least four Fkh TFs known to be required for proper cardiac development in mammals and three Fkh genes linked to human congenital heart defects.  Our prior work demonstrated that two Drosophila Fkh genes, jumeau (jumu) and Checkpoint suppressor homologue (CHES-1-like), determine cardiac cell fates, number and position by regulating a Polo-kinase pathway to mediate three distinct categories of cardiac progenitor cell divisions.  Our genetic studies further revealed that these two genes also act in a partially redundant manner to regulate other, Polo-independent aspects of cardiogenesis.  Finally, we found that Fkh TF binding sites were significantly enriched in combination with those of other known cardiogenic TFs in the enhancers of genes expressed in the heart.  Collectively, these results suggested that these two Fkh TFs mediate multiple cardiogenic processes by regulating a large number of downstream effector genes.  In order to identify these Fkh target genes and the distinct cardiogenic processes in which they are involved, we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of flow cytometry-sorted cardiac mesodermal cells from wild-type embryos as well as from jumu and CHES-1-like gain- and loss-of-function embryos, including the double mutants.  An initial analysis of these expression profiling-identified putative Fkh target genes based on significant enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) attributes indicated that they are indeed involved in numerous cardiogenic processes, including those as diverse as initial specification of the cardiac mesoderm, establishment of the heart lumen, proper positioning of different heart cell types, sarcomere and myofibril formation, assembly of mitochondrial subunits and processes, and cardiac progenitor cell divisions.    We are currently conducting genetic and RNAi-based functional investigations of these putative Fkh target genes in the heart in order to reveal the molecular basis of their cardiogenic activities.  Of note, by combining classical genetic interaction and rescue assays with cis/trans-regulatory transgenic reporter studies, we demonstrated that the initial specification of the cardiac mesoderm is partly mediated by both Fkh genes regulating the expression of a Fibroblast growth factor receptor.  Additionally, synergistic genetic interactions demonstrated that Myb, identified in the machine learning approach described in Project 1, functions in concert with both Jumu and CHES-1-like TFs to govern Polo-dependent cardiac progenitor cell divisions.  Collectively, these studies are elucidating the molecular pathways used in multiple Fkh-mediated cardiogenic pathways, and are revealing how these cardiac subnetworks are orchestrated by a finite set of TFs. n/a",Functional studies of individual transcription factors in mesoderm development,8939907,ZIAHL006164,"['Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiac', 'Categories', 'Cell division', 'Cells', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila polo protein', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Family', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Mesoderm', 'Mesoderm Cell', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Myofibrils', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Sarcomeres', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stem cells', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cell type', 'forkhead protein', 'genome-wide', 'heart cell', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",ZIA,2014,632794,-0.009619251850913425
"Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A holy grail of bioinformatics is the creation of whole-cell models with the ability to enhance human understanding and facilitate discovery. To this end, a successful and widely-used effort is the Gene Ontology (GO), a massive project to manually annotate genes into terms describing molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components and provide relationships between terms, e.g. capturing that ""small ribosomal subunit"" and ""large ribosomal subunit"" come together to make ""ribosome"". GO is widely used to understand the function of a gene or group of genes. Unfortunately, GO is limited by the effort required to create and update it by hand. It exists only for well-studied organisms and even then in only one, generic form per organism with limited overall genome coverage and a bias towards well-studied genes and functions. It is not possible to learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using GO, and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism, let alone a specific cell-type or disease-state.  This proposed research will change this state of affairs. Already, work has shown that large networks of gene and protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used to computationally infer an ontology whose coverage and power are equivalent to those of the manually-curated GO Cellular Component ontology. Still, this first attempt was limited in the types of experimental data used and its ability to infer the more generally useful Biological Process ontology. Here machine learning approaches will be applied to integrate many types of experimental data into ontology model construction and analyze the type of biological information provided by each experiment, revealing those experiments most informative for capturing Biological Process information. Furthermore, the high-throughput experimental data to ontology paradigm explored here will be used to develop a computational tool to highlight novel types of hypotheses that are inaccessible by current high-throughput experimental data analysis methods.  Preliminary work has shown GO to be useful for prediction of synthetic lethal pairs of genes, i.e. genes that are individually non-essential but when knocked out together cause cell death. Given the high mutation rate in cancer, these pairs provide potential cancer drug targets, as a drug may target a gene product which is now essential in the mutated cancer cells but not other cells, thereby killing only cancer cells. Because data-driven ontologies are not as hindered by issues with bias and coverage and are specifically designed to capture only functional relationships, this proposal will explore the idea that data-driven ontologies will be better suited to help predict synthetic lethal pairs than GO. To this end, algorithms will be developed to construct a data-driven ontology of yeast DNA repair and use this ontology to predict synthetic lethal pairs of genes.  Overall, this proposal will develop the computational and experimental roadmap to construct a whole-cell model of gene function - an ontology - and use the model to discover useful biology - synthetic lethal pairs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, a new framework for using the results of commonly performed, genome-wide experiments has the potential to create whole-cell models of gene function, similar to the widely-used Gene Ontology, directly from data without manual intervention. This will allow creation of useful models of cells from different organisms, tissues and diseases which researchers can use to discover the function of unstudied genes and to uncover new functions performed by the cell. Furthermore, this proposal will use these models for the discovery of new cancer drug targets called synthetic lethal pairs of genes.            ",Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis,8644512,F30HG007618,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Processed Genes', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological information processing', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental analysis', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2014,35110,0.0009648008315275653
"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules.           We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing. We will also develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features from RNA-seq experiments.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks  Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.  Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases.

"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY  Abstract The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013). This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies. The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project.  Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of the Data Generation Aim is to produce high quality data measuring phenotypes, protein and phosphoproteomics, and RNA expression in 30 cell lines grown on diverse microenvironments (ME). This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures.

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity. Astonishingly, as much as 80% of human DNA is transcribed into RNA as recently reported by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. New classes of RNA are being identified including many which are non-protein coding (ncRNA). Nonetheless ncRNAs are involved in regulating cellular activity. Deciphering the structure-function relationship of these RNAs is of immediate importance as ncRNAs have now been implicated in a variety of diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1, prostate cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease-like 2. Traditional approaches to determine high-resolution RNA 3D structures have proven to be prohibitively time consuming and expensive. Nymirum has developed an Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System that is faster, cheaper, and more robust than current approaches. This System will be commercialized for use by the drug industry and academic researchers in their quest to understand and treat human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA 3D structure and function information is critical to understanding basic cell function, delineating dysfunctional RNA contribution to human disease, and finding new drugs to treat diseases caused by dysfunctional RNAs.

"Computational Approaches for RNA StructureFunction Determination Our previous discovery of the turnip crinkle virus tRNA-like translational enhancer (TCV TSS) motivated us to search for similar elements in other viruses. As a result, the middle of the UTR of the pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) was found, by our modeling, to have a comparable T-shaped 3D motif (kl-TSS), a CITE, that is similar in both structure and function to the TCV element. This structure, however, does not contain pseudoknots like the TCV element. It was shown that a hairpin loop in the T-shaped PEMV engages in a long-distance kissing loop interaction with a hairpin stem loop just down-stream of the start codon. It was also shown that ribosomes bind to the kissing complex as well as to the T-shaped element alone. Analysis indicated that mutations in the element that reduced translation also reduced ribosome binding or the RNA-RNA kissing loop kl-TSS interaction. This element is also presumed to be important not only for delivery of ribosomes to the 5' end of the virus, but also in associating the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E with the 5' end due the binding of eIF4E with a nearby downstream element the PTE. We developed the programs CovaRna and CovStat to explore long-range co-varying RNA interaction networks using whole genome alignments. This new methodology was applied to Drosophila genomes. A parallel version of the program was devised to speed-up processing and the algorithms also rely on fast indexing schemes and conservative statistical methods to determine highly significant interactions. The methodology found interesting interactions that appear to be related to endogenous siRNAs, gene transport, and to synchronized mutations that may include common interaction partners. These results indicate the potential importance of such networks. The World Health Organization estimates there may be as many as 50-100 million cases of dengue fever per year. We characterized the untranslated regions of the virus focusing on the 3' UTR and its effects on replication and translation. We used MPGAfold and StructureLab to analyze the folding characteristics of a subgenomic (minigenome) RNA from dengue type 2 as well as mutated variants. We previously showed that MPGAfold is capable of predicting the secondary structure and folding dynamics including co-transcriptional folding of various RNAs. Our computational results were correlated with experiments on a 719 nt minigenome consisting mostly of the 5' and 3' UTRs and a dengue type 2 replicon containing a Renilla luciferase reporter. Attention was focused on the formation of two dumbbell-like structures found to form in the 3' UTR with the putative formation of pseudoknots involving regions downstream from the dumbbells. The computational results showed a significant preference for the formation of the 3' dumbbell over the 5' dumbbell. Mutational studies indicated that the motifs involved in dumbbell formation including the putative pseudoknots were important for replication but had less significant varying effects on translation. In a later related study Selective 2'-hydroxyl Acylation Analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) analysis was done on the minigenome and the mutational variants. Most of the MPGAfold predicted structures were found to be present by SHAPE, including the 5'-3' interactions and the dumbbell structures. SHAPE found evidence for the formation of the 5' pseudoknot structure, but the formation of the 3' pseudoknot appeared to be complicated by the presence of a portion of the 3' pseudoknot sequence being involved in the cyclization motive involving a 5' sequence. Understanding sequence related conformational characteristics of kissing loop formation is important for understanding the formation of these motifs in RNA viruses such as HIV and is also important for understanding their formation for use in RNA-based nanodesign. We explored two HIV-1 kissing loop monomers (from subtype-A and subtype B). Our hypothesis in this study was that the structure of the monomer loop was important for the assembly of the dimer. It was experimentally shown that subtype-B monomers dimerize in high salt concentrations (NaCl) or in the presence of magnesium, while subtype-A requires coordination of magnesium ions with phosphate groups associated with bases in the loop irrespective of the salt concentration. We performed molecular dynamics simulations on the monomers with varying salt concentrations and with and without magnesium. We found that at low salt concentrations that the structures of the monomers were significantly deformed and not conducive for dimerization. At high salt concentrations, the simulations showed that the subtype-B monomer maintained its shape and was conducive for dimerization, while the subtype-A loop was significantly deformed. It was also found that two flanking bases in the loops were important for maintaining the structure of the loop. Subtype-A's loop was stabilized in the presence of magnesium coordinating with the two flanking bases. Restraints were also applied to atoms near the bottom of the loops with no salt or magnesium present. It was shown that the restraints maintained the shape of the monomer, but when released the monomers became distorted. Thus, the MD simulations strongly suggest that salt and magnesium play important but somewhat different roles in maintaining the proper conformations of the HIV monomers, which in turn may be indicative of proper dimer formation. MicroRNA 137 has been implicated with other microRNAs to be associated with neurogenesis and brain tumor development. Specifically, its up-regulation has been shown to be important for neuro cell differentiation and down-regulation has been implicated in disease processes. A genome-wide target mapping was performed on glioblastoma cells. 1468 genes were found to be negatively impacted by miR-137. Computational analysis also revealed that many of the genes had a highly likely interaction with miR-137 seed region. Several of the targeted genes were related to neurogenesis and oncogenic proteins. Other miRNAs, namely miR-124, 128 and 7 also regulate targets that are regulated by miR-137 and are associated with neurogenesis and tumorgenesis, thus their increase or decrease can have significant implications for the genetic control of neurogenesis or tumorgenesis. Over 150 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). We investigated the synergistic effects that infection by the virus has on the course of the virus. The elevation of the expression of IFNL3 mRNA is known to help in clearance of the virus. In particular, a new means was discovered whereby HCV affects this antiviral response. This mechanism is dependent on a mutation found in the 3' UTR of IFNL3 mRNA that controls transcript stability. The mutation had an effect on AU-rich dependent decay of the transcript and the binding of a microRNA induced by HCV infection. RNA structural analysis showed that the indicated mutation in the 3' UTR of IFNL3 had the potential to alter the structure and thereby prevent AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins from degrading the RNA. In addition, it was found that the mutation prevents the binding of microRNAs that cause down-regulation of this gene. MicroRNAs, which arise from precursor transcripts, play an important role in cellular gene regulation. An algorithm was developed, MirID, to distinguish pre-miRNAs stem-loop structures from pseudo pre-miRNAs. The algorithm accepts an RNA sequence as input and classifies the sequence as either containing a pre-miRNA or a pseudo pre-miRNA. 74 different features were tested in various combinations to find the best models for classifying the pre-miRNAs. A support vector machine was used to construct a classifier ensemble. The accuracy of the method is further enhanced by the use of an AdaBoost algorithm. Results show high accuracy for classification. n/a",Computational Approaches for RNA StructureFunction Determination,8937658,ZIABC008382,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Acylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antiviral Response', 'Attention', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cyclization', 'Dengue', 'Development', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drosophila genome', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HIV-1', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Indium', 'Initiator Codon', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Primer Extension', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Viruses', 'RNA analysis', 'Renilla Luciferases', 'Replicon', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Shapes', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translations', 'Turnip - dietary', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Up-Regulation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'dimer', 'drug development', 'gene repression', 'genome-wide', 'indexing', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'magnesium ion', 'molecular dynamics', 'monomer', 'neurogenesis', 'pea enation mosaic virus', 'pre-miRNA', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2014,351760,-0.005544581003580741
"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.            ",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,8653749,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'DRADA2b protein', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Smooth Muscle Myosins', 'Steno', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'calponin', 'dsRNA adenosine deaminase', 'gain of function', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2014,372500,0.026825412850320623
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs Abstract A most basic difference between cells of the same genotype and different phenotype lies in their transcriptome. Understanding the difference between two transcriptomes in terms of the RNA molecules present in each, or changes in abundance of specific molecules, can offer valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease, development, and specialization. High throughput sequencing provides a unique view of the transcriptome in the form of millions or even billions of short reads of nucleotide sequences sampled from the RNA molecules. To date, nearly 1000 such RNA-seq datasets have already been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Beyond measuring differences in overall expression of genes between samples, there is a critical need to measure differences in expression at the transcript level. Computational tools that can extract significant changes in transcript diversity across populations with RNA-seq are in immediate demand. However, reconstructing the full extent of transcript isoforms from this wealth of data is not a solved problem because of fundamental ambiguities between isoforms at the scale of the short read samples.  We propose a novel approach to the differential analysis of transcriptomes that does not depend on the reconstruction of the full-length transcripts, and yet can accurately pinpoint the variation of transcriptomes. Our techniques are data-driven and applicable to any transcriptome, requiring only a reference genome, and do not depend on a priori gene structure annotations. Our research program builds on our highly sensitive and accurate MapSplice alignment algorithm to construct expression weighted splice graphs (ESG) from RNA-seq datasets. ESGs can be three orders of magnitude smaller in size than current RNA-seq datasets, yet fully represent the substantive biological content of such datasets. The ESG representation supports highly efficient analysis techniques that can directly identify and visualize statistically significant differential transcription between samples. Generalizations of the algorithms are proposed to identify co-regulated splicing patterns that are keys for biological pathway analyses and systems biology analyses.  We have established an ongoing interactive and collaborative research environment among the co-PIs and Co-Is which include the biologists, computer scientists and statistician. The proposed computational methods will be tested and refined using RNA-seq data generated from breast cancer cell lines before being further applied to three well curated RNA-seq datasets on lung cancer pathogenesis, stem cells in leukemia, and equine articular cartilage development and repair (a non-model mammalian organism). Experimental validation of differentially expressed transcript isoforms will both improve the accuracy of our methods, as well as propose novel candidates for alternative isoforms associated with lung cancer,and leukemia diseases, and chondrocyte differentiation.  The software will be open-source and will be developed as a set of components that can be used on their own or integrated into RNA-seq processing workflows. In particular we will integrate the components into the Galaxy cloud computing framework hosted on a local server. As such the methods will be available to researchers worldwide. As components mature they may be installed in other servers worldwide to provide a convenient and secure way to analyze transcriptomes.  Unveiling the dynamics of the transcriptome at modest cost will revolutionize cellular diagnostics and biomedical research. Genome-wide measurement of transcription variants offers the potential for detailed molecular information about cellular identity and function that will greatly expand traditional histological assessment. Cloud-based access to the methods can turn individual laboratories into small genome centers and will enable individual scientists to assess differences among RNA transcriptomes in a matter of days. Our suite of algorithms will enable biomedical researchers to prioritize candidate genes or different gene ontology categories to investigate further for differential transcription and mechanistic importance between experimental conditions. Project Narrative  This project will develop new techniques to compare the transcriptome of different cells, sampled using high-throughput sequencing technology. As the transcriptome consists of the RNA ""instructions"" controlling the cell's functions, differential analysis can provide detailed insight into the difference between healthy and diseased cells, or can be used to more clearly discover the functional differences between, say, liver cells and brain cells.",Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs,8660317,R01HG006272,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer cell line', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Cloud Computing', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Structure', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Hepatocyte', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'articular cartilage', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cartilage development', 'cartilage repair', 'cloud based', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'statistics', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2014,403681,0.009272610529714108

"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.

"Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of adult hematopoietic malignancy. It has a high rate of disease relapse, a consequence of chemoresistance. Recent biological studies suggest that a major component of the relapse phenotype resides in a rare population of leukemic stem cells (LSC), characterized by extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential, and poor response to standard chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize that i) common molecular characteristics inherent to LSC-enriched populations reflect the biology of heterogeneous AML with unfavorable prognostic features; ii) these associations can be derived from systematic analysis of gene and microRNA expression profiles, and other biologic characteristics of bulk AML samples. The overarching goal of this project is to define LSC-characterized transcription factor (TF) and microRNA interactions in heterogeneous AMLs. We proposed to integrate both qualified data-driven and curated knowledge about LSC characteristics, and clinical outcomes from bulk AML. Specifically, we will perform meta-analyses on a pathway level to build LSC-specific biology, focusing on AML prognostic TF/microRNA deregulation. These approaches are supported by our two pioneering mathematical methodologies: the Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression (FAIME) and the mechanism-anchored Phenotypes-Genotype Network (PGNet). FAIME provides a novel process for transforming extensive available gene expression profiles into individual pathway profiles, resulting in more reproducible pathway signatures (46% overlap among three cohorts, empirical p<0.001). The PGNet method reveals genes regulated by disease-critical regulators and can accurately predict patient outcomes - shifting the paradigm from single gene/microRNA analysis towards ""mechanism anchored profiling"". Using PGNet, we have successfully predicted that the epigenetic regulator HDAC9 is associated with survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Innovatively, this project will interrogate microRNAs/genes that regulate LSC-specific biological pathways and AML prognostication, integrating regulator-regulator interactions and regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 1, we will build LSC-specific gene pathways and identify regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 2, we will correlate LSC-specific regulators and their target genes corresponding to AML outcomes. In Aim 3, we will develop novel approaches to computationally model the crucial interactions among the LSC-specific regulators and prognostic gene targets. Both the abundance of available AML patient profiles and the proven ability of our proposed methods suggest that we will achieve our aim to build an LSC-driven prognostic model.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have long been committed to the development of statistical algorithms and software tools for high-throughput data analyses (e.g. the Bioconductor package OrderedList, the online tools GOModule). These tools allow an effective functional integration of transcriptome information with clinical endpoints. This project will systematically build a pre-clinical model of the leukemic stem cell, a critical subpopulation in acute myeloid leukemia that integrates transcriptome, crucial microRNAs, targeting genes, and other biologic/clinical endpoints. This robust computational structure will facilitate predictions f outcomes and the identification of key oncogenic targets.            ",Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis,8688175,R21CA167305,"['Accounting', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioconductor', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Qualifying', 'Reading', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Translating', 'Yang', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'feeding', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'mathematical methods', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'stemness', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2014,166670,0.02456007132023041
"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.          Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.

"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis. The success of this project will be important in bridging statistical machine learning and cancer research.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster.

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3. Extension of a newly-initiated toolbox for machine learning applications in molecular evolution. 4. Creation and maintenance of a wiki-themed documentation resource.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules.           We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing. We will also develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features from RNA-seq experiments.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks  Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.  Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Functional RNA elements in the human genome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome. Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease. This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions. The proposed research will use the latest genomics technologies to reveal functional RNA elements in the human genome, which will provide the molecular basis for many RNA-related human diseases.",Functional RNA elements in the human genome,8471148,R01HG004659,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Award', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cistrons', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exons', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'crosslink', 'empowered', 'functional group', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'mammalian genome', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,649400,-0.014497568283716265
"Blood Studies of Endothelial Function and Systemic Inflammation Recent publications are summarized below, adapted from the article's abstracts:  1. A systematic comparison and evaluation of high density exon arrays and RNA-seq technology used to unravel the peripheral blood transcriptome of sickle cell disease.  BACKGROUND: Transcriptomic studies in clinical research are essential tools for deciphering the functional elements of the genome and unraveling underlying disease mechanisms. Various technologies have been developed to deduce and quantify the transcriptome including hybridization and sequencing-based approaches. Recently, high density exon microarrays have been successfully employed for detecting differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing events for biomarker discovery and disease diagnostics. The field of transcriptomics is currently being revolutionized by high throughput DNA sequencing methodologies to map, characterize, and quantify the transcriptome.  METHODS: In an effort to understand the merits and limitations of each of these tools, we undertook a study of the transcriptome in sickle cell disease, a monogenic disease comparing the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST microarray (Exon array) and Illumina's deep sequencing technology (RNA-seq) on whole blood clinical specimens.  RESULTS: Analysis indicated a strong concordance (R&#8201;=&#8201;0.64) between Exon array and RNA-seq data at both gene level and exon level transcript expression. The magnitude of differential expression was found to be generally higher in RNA-seq than in the Exon microarrays. We also demonstrate for the first time the ability of RNA-seq technology to discover novel transcript variants and differential expression in previously unannotated genomic regions in sickle cell disease. In addition to detecting expression level changes, RNA-seq technology was also able to identify sequence variation in the expressed transcripts.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that microarrays remain useful and accurate for transcriptomic analysis of clinical samples with low input requirements, while RNA-seq technology complements and extends microarray measurements for novel discoveries.  2. A novel molecular signature for elevated tricuspid regurgitation velocity in sickle cell disease.  Rationale: An increased tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity (TRV > 2.5 m/s) and pulmonary hypertension defined by right heart catheterization both independently confer increased mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD).   Objectives: We explored the usefulness of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived gene signatures as biomarkers for an elevated TRV in SCD.   Methods: Twenty-seven patients with SCD underwent echocardiography and peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation for expression profiling and 112 patients with SCD were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms.   Measurements and Main Results: Genome-wide gene and miRNA expression profiles were correlated against TRV, yielding 631 transcripts and 12 miRNAs. Support vector machine analysis identified a 10-gene signature including GALNT13 (encoding polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 13) that discriminates patients with and without increased TRV with 100% accuracy. This finding was then validated in a cohort of patients with SCD without (n = 10) and with pulmonary hypertension (n = 10, 90% accuracy). Increased TRV-related miRNAs revealed strong in silico binding predictions of miR-301a to GALNT13 corroborated by microarray analyses demonstrating an inverse correlation between their expression. A genetic association study comparing patients with an elevated (n = 49) versus normal (n = 63) TRV revealed five significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms within GALNT13 (P < 0.005), four trans-acting (P < 2.1  10(-7)) and one cis-acting (P = 0.6  10(-4)) expression quantitative trait locus upstream of the adenosine-A2B receptor gene (ADORA2B).   Conclusions: These studies validate the clinical usefulness of genomic signatures as potential biomarkers and highlight ADORA2B and GALNT13 as potential candidate genes in SCD-associated elevated TRV. n/a",Blood Studies of Endothelial Function and Systemic Inflammation,8746610,ZIAHL006013,"['Adenosine A2B Receptor', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematology', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Chemicals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specimen', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'abstracting', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'density', 'fetal globin', 'genetic association', 'genome-wide', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'member', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'sickling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'volunteer']",NHLBI,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",ZIA,2013,116613,0.016814196092672193
"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.        We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions. Public availability of our system will advance genome-level understanding of human biology and facilitate development of novel drugs, therapies, and personalized medical treatments.

"Microarray and Genome Informatics Completed an implementation of a strategy to detect the exonization of transposable elements (TEs) in human coding sequences.  TEs have long been regarded as selfish or junk DNA having little or no role in the regulation or functioning of the human genome.  However, over the past several years this view came to be challenged as several studies provided anecdotal as well as global evidence for the contribution of transposable elements to the regulatory and coding needs of human genes.  We explored the incorporation and regulation of coding sequences donated by TEs using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, CAGE, and DNase1 hypersensitivity data in two human hematopoietic cell-lines characterized by the ENCODE project.  We compared transcriptome assembly with and without the aid of a reference transcriptome and found that the percentage of genes that incorporate transposable elements in their coding sequences is significantly greater than that obtained from the reference transcriptome assemblies using two gene models.  Using a data integration approach, we demonstrated the epigenetic regulation of the TE derived coding sequences.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Completed the development of procedures for the analysis of gene expression and next generation sequence data.  We developed a novel way to analyze RNA-Seq data for detection of alternative polyadenylation (APA).  Using a Poisson hidden Markov model (PHMM) to detect high and low expression states of RNA-Seq expression at the 3' untranslated region (UTR), we identified genes that have tissue specific APA between cortex (brain) and liver tissues in the human.  We also showed that analyzing the 3' UTR with RNA-Seq in this manner is advantageous than using microarray profiling given the variability of the probes at the 3' end of the genes.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Continued the collaborative support of investigators' research:  1) We employed bioinformatics strategies to predict toxicity in the rat liver from exposure to toxicants using gene expression data. We also derived of a bioinformatics strategy to differentiate modes of actions for these toxicants based on regulatory pathways enriched by differentially expressed genes (data from microarray and RNA-Seq platforms).  2) We used our custom extracting patterns and identifying co-expressed genes (EPIG) analysis tool to find genes which respond differently to the order of chemotherapeutic drug administered to rats and to identify microRNAs differentially expressed between tissues. 3) We developed an analysis workflow called PIPERS (Pipeline Informatics for Processing and Examining RNA-Seq) to detect allele-specific expression in two NIEHS/National Toxicology Program mouse strains.  In addition, we developed analytical strategies to detect differentially methylated region from bisulfite sequencing data.  4) We used statistical modeling of gene expression data from humans exposed to acetaminophen in order to identify early indicators of hepatotoxicity. 5) We developed an improved support vector machines (SVMs) classifier to suit multiclass predictions based on gene expression data. 6) We integrated transcription factor binding information with genotype data and microarray gene expression data to identify population differences between transcript-regulator expression quantitative trait loci (TReQTLs). n/a",Microarray and Genome Informatics,8734156,ZIAES102345,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Acetaminophen', 'Alleles', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Custom', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Microarray Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Informatics', 'Junk DNA', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mouse Strains', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'National Toxicology Program', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polyadenylation', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selfish DNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'data integration', 'human data', 'improved', 'markov model', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES,ZIA,2013,664080,-0.023934169728432632
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs Abstract A most basic difference between cells of the same genotype and different phenotype lies in their transcriptome. Understanding the difference between two transcriptomes in terms of the RNA molecules present in each, or changes in abundance of specific molecules, can offer valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease, development, and specialization. High throughput sequencing provides a unique view of the transcriptome in the form of millions or even billions of short reads of nucleotide sequences sampled from the RNA molecules. To date, nearly 1000 such RNA-seq datasets have already been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Beyond measuring differences in overall expression of genes between samples, there is a critical need to measure differences in expression at the transcript level. Computational tools that can extract significant changes in transcript diversity across populations with RNA-seq are in immediate demand. However, reconstructing the full extent of transcript isoforms from this wealth of data is not a solved problem because of fundamental ambiguities between isoforms at the scale of the short read samples.  We propose a novel approach to the differential analysis of transcriptomes that does not depend on the reconstruction of the full-length transcripts, and yet can accurately pinpoint the variation of transcriptomes. Our techniques are data-driven and applicable to any transcriptome, requiring only a reference genome, and do not depend on a priori gene structure annotations. Our research program builds on our highly sensitive and accurate MapSplice alignment algorithm to construct expression weighted splice graphs (ESG) from RNA-seq datasets. ESGs can be three orders of magnitude smaller in size than current RNA-seq datasets, yet fully represent the substantive biological content of such datasets. The ESG representation supports highly efficient analysis techniques that can directly identify and visualize statistically significant differential transcription between samples. Generalizations of the algorithms are proposed to identify co-regulated splicing patterns that are keys for biological pathway analyses and systems biology analyses.  We have established an ongoing interactive and collaborative research environment among the co-PIs and Co-Is which include the biologists, computer scientists and statistician. The proposed computational methods will be tested and refined using RNA-seq data generated from breast cancer cell lines before being further applied to three well curated RNA-seq datasets on lung cancer pathogenesis, stem cells in leukemia, and equine articular cartilage development and repair (a non-model mammalian organism). Experimental validation of differentially expressed transcript isoforms will both improve the accuracy of our methods, as well as propose novel candidates for alternative isoforms associated with lung cancer,and leukemia diseases, and chondrocyte differentiation.  The software will be open-source and will be developed as a set of components that can be used on their own or integrated into RNA-seq processing workflows. In particular we will integrate the components into the Galaxy cloud computing framework hosted on a local server. As such the methods will be available to researchers worldwide. As components mature they may be installed in other servers worldwide to provide a convenient and secure way to analyze transcriptomes.  Unveiling the dynamics of the transcriptome at modest cost will revolutionize cellular diagnostics and biomedical research. Genome-wide measurement of transcription variants offers the potential for detailed molecular information about cellular identity and function that will greatly expand traditional histological assessment. Cloud-based access to the methods can turn individual laboratories into small genome centers and will enable individual scientists to assess differences among RNA transcriptomes in a matter of days.

"Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of adult hematopoietic malignancy. It has a high rate of disease relapse, a consequence of chemoresistance. Recent biological studies suggest that a major component of the relapse phenotype resides in a rare population of leukemic stem cells (LSC), characterized by extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential, and poor response to standard chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize that i) common molecular characteristics inherent to LSC-enriched populations reflect the biology of heterogeneous AML with unfavorable prognostic features; ii) these associations can be derived from systematic analysis of gene and microRNA expression profiles, and other biologic characteristics of bulk AML samples. The overarching goal of this project is to define LSC-characterized transcription factor (TF) and microRNA interactions in heterogeneous AMLs. We proposed to integrate both qualified data-driven and curated knowledge about LSC characteristics, and clinical outcomes from bulk AML. Specifically, we will perform meta-analyses on a pathway level to build LSC-specific biology, focusing on AML prognostic TF/microRNA deregulation. These approaches are supported by our two pioneering mathematical methodologies: the Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression (FAIME) and the mechanism-anchored Phenotypes-Genotype Network (PGNet). FAIME provides a novel process for transforming extensive available gene expression profiles into individual pathway profiles, resulting in more reproducible pathway signatures (46% overlap among three cohorts, empirical p<0.001). The PGNet method reveals genes regulated by disease-critical regulators and can accurately predict patient outcomes - shifting the paradigm from single gene/microRNA analysis towards ""mechanism anchored profiling"". Using PGNet, we have successfully predicted that the epigenetic regulator HDAC9 is associated with survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Innovatively, this project will interrogate microRNAs/genes that regulate LSC-specific biological pathways and AML prognostication, integrating regulator-regulator interactions and regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 1, we will build LSC-specific gene pathways and identify regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 2, we will correlate LSC-specific regulators and their target genes corresponding to AML outcomes. In Aim 3, we will develop novel approaches to computationally model the crucial interactions among the LSC-specific regulators and prognostic gene targets. Both the abundance of available AML patient profiles and the proven ability of our proposed methods suggest that we will achieve our aim to build an LSC-driven prognostic model.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have long been committed to the development of statistical algorithms and software tools for high-throughput data analyses (e.g. the Bioconductor package OrderedList, the online tools GOModule). These tools allow an effective functional integration of transcriptome information with clinical endpoints. This project will systematically build a pre-clinical model of the leukemic stem cell, a critical subpopulation in acute myeloid leukemia that integrates transcriptome, crucial microRNAs, targeting genes, and other biologic/clinical endpoints. This robust computational structure will facilitate predictions f outcomes and the identification of key oncogenic targets.            ",Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis,8583454,R21CA167305,"['Accounting', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioconductor', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Qualifying', 'Reading', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Translating', 'Yang', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'feeding', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'stemness', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2013,203415,0.02456007132023041
"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans.

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.          Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.

"Computational Approaches for RNA StructureFunction Determination -Computational Detection of Abundant Long-range Nucleotide Co-variation in Genomes- A novel computational methodology was developed to detect long-range co-variation on a genomic scale producing high and medium confidence interactinos networks. To test the algorithm, it was applied to a set of aligned drosophila genomes where it was found that there are prevalent long-range co-variations between exons of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs, including endo-siRNAs. Most of the co-variations appear to be the result of synchronized mutations, not reverse complementarity. The genes found to co-vary are enriched for functions related to regionalization as well as neural and developmental processes. In a lower confidence interaction network there is a bias towards genes that have cellular component annotations such as plasma membrane or cytoskeleton. This may be an indicator of a widespread phenomenon of hitchhiking, in which transcripts bind to other RNAs that are part of ribonucleoprotein complexes which are transported along the cytoskeleton. These interactions may occur in a statistical size dependent manner. These results indicate that RNA-RNA long-range interactions are a widespread phenomenon that is important to a variety of cellular processes. - Discovery and Characterization of a Novel Translational Enhancers - 3' UTRs of cellular and viral mRNAs harbor elements that function in gene expression by enhancing translation using unknown mechanisms. To determine the function of these elements we previously used the Turnip crinkle virus (TCV). TCV is translated in a cap-independent fashion and contains a 3' region that together with the 5' UTR synergistically enhances translation. We recently discovered another element of this type in the Pea enation mosaic virus, however, this translational enhancer element acts in a somewhat different way. We used a set of computational tools, including RNA2D3D for 3D RNA modeling, developed in our lab, and experimental methods to show that this element is T-shaped, which is reminiscent of TCV's similarity to tRNA. We showed that it binds ribosomes and engages in a long range kissing loop RNA-RNA interaction. Its functionality suggests a means for RNA 5'/3' cyclization and thus a mechanism for translational enhancement. It appears that the existence of these novel elements is suggesting alternate translational mechanisms that may be found in eukaryotic organisms. - Understanding the Structure and Function of the Dengue Virus - It has recently been reported that there are over 400 million cases of dengue fever in the world, 4 times more than previously reported with 10% leading to severe forms of the disease. Using our massively parallel genetic algorithm for RNA folding we showed that the core region of the 3' untranslated region of dengue virus RNA can form 2 dumbell structures of unequal frequencies of occurrence. It was experimentally shown that structural motifs formed from these dumbells are important for viral replication. Also it was shown that there is a cooperative synergy with both dumbells for translation. Thus, the cis-acting elements in the core region of dengue virus are required for both replication and optimal translation. Recently, we performed a detailed structural analysis of the dengue minigenome using acylation techniques (SHAPE), lead induced hydrolysis and site directed mutagenesis. Results indicate protein independent interactions between the 5' and 3' terminal regions corroborating many of the predicted interactions and shedding light on the pseudoknot interactions found in the 3' UTR and the sequence dependency on the 5' cyclization region. -The Role of Ions and Flanking Bases in the Dimerization of HIV-1- Experimentally it has been shown that the characterization of HIV-1 kissing loop formation differs depending on the subtype of the virus. It has been shown that subtype-B monomers dimerize at high salt concentrations or in the presence of magnesium ions while subtype-A monomers will only dimerize with a magnesium ion bound to the flanking G273 phosphate group or the phosphate group of G274 regardless of the salt concentration. We found using computer simulations that at low concentrations both types of monomer hairpin loops were significantly deformed and the bases in the hairpin loop that are associated with dimerization were turned inward. At high salt concentrations the subtype-B monomer maintained a shape conducive to dimerization, while subtype-A still showed significant deformations. Also the flanking bases in subtype-B helped to stabilize the conformation while the flanking base G273 in subtype-A caused deformation. However, when magnesium ions were present and bound to the G273 or G274 phosphate groups, base G273 maintained a conformation that stabilized the loop for dimerization. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms that are involved in the HIV-1 virus life cycle. -Classifying Pre-miRNA via Combinatorial Feature Mining and Boosting MicroRNAs are non-coding RNAs consisting of about 22 nucleotides that are derived from precursor molecules. These precursors usually fold into stem-loop hairpin structures. When scanning genomes it is difficult to distinguish false positive pre-miRNAs from the real thing. In this research a new method was developed for identifying and classifying pre-miRNAs. A combinatorial feature mining approach was used to discover a good set of features. These feature sets were then used to train support vector machines to obtain classification models. A boosting algorithm was then applied to further enhance the accuracy. Results indicate significant improvement over previous methods. -Discovering Common Folding Patterns in two RNA Sequences- An efficient dynamic programming algorithm was developed that uses ordered labeled trees for discovering the largest common RNA substructures given 2 RNA sequences. This algorithm can also be used to discover repeated regions of RNA secondary structure. -Multiscale Modeling of Double Helical DNA and RNA Unified through Lie Groups- In order to further understand motions that are inherent in nucleic acid helices, several means of mechanical modeling, continuous and discrete, of double-stranded nucleic acid helical structures (DNA and RNA)were reviewed and a new analysis method using Lie groups was used to reconcile the models. Rigid body motions were analyzed. At the most coarse level worm-like chains were used with anisotropic bending stiffness. It was then shown that bi-rod models converge to this for long enough lengths. We then showed how full atomic resolution molecular dynamics and experimental results obtained from atomic force microscopy relate to the models. n/a",Computational Approaches for RNA StructureFunction Determination,8763015,ZIABC008382,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Acylation', 'Algorithms', 'Atomic Force Microscopy', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cyclization', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Virus', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genome', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'HIV-1', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Hydrolysis', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Folding', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Support', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trees', 'Turnip - dietary', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cis acting element', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'drug development', 'indexing', 'inorganic phosphate', 'magnesium ion', 'molecular dynamics', 'monomer', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'pea enation mosaic virus', 'pre-miRNA', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal rods', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'viral RNA', 'web site']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2013,309292,0.020906502109949786
"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data.

"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Nave Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) develop computational pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop efficient algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to predict the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated.

"Environmental/genetic Risk Factors and Pathogenesis of Autoimmune Disease Multidisciplinary studies - including clinical, immunologic, pathologic, epidemiologic and molecular genetic investigations - are being used to complement findings in each area and overcome limitations inherent in each approach. Current studies are focusing on: exploring possible environmental risk and protective factors; identifying genetic risk and protective factors by candidate gene and whole genome SNP analyses; defining the associations among clinical, laboratory and immunologic features of autoimmune diseases for diagnostic, prognostic and pathogenic purposes; and understanding differences in epigenetics, gene expression and proteomic patterns between monozygotic twins discordant for disease. Evaluation of exposures to silica, organic solvents, ultraviolet light, vaccinations, selected drugs and dietary supplements, hormones and pregnancy, tobacco smoke, stressful life events and infectious agents in the development of systemic autoimmune diseases are being conducted via a study of twins and close siblings discordant for systemic autoimmune disease.  Little is known about the prevalence, types, and sociodemographic and biobehavioral correlates of autoimmunity, and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are the best general test for autoimmunity. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 4,754 individuals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. ANAs were assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. In ANA-positive individuals, cellular staining patterns were determined, and specific autoantibody reactivities were assessed by immunoprecipitation. We found that the ANA prevalence in the US population of individuals ages 12 years and older was 13.8% (95% confidence interval 95% CI 12.2-15.5%). Our findings suggest that more than 32 million persons in the US have ANAs, and that the prevalence is higher among females, older individuals, African Americans, and those with a normal body weight. These data will serve as a useful baseline for future investigations of predictors and changes in ANA prevalence over time.  One of the objectives of the NIH twin-sib study is to determine if multiple systemic autoimmune diseases (SAID) share gene expression pathways that could provide insights into pathogenic mechanisms common to these disorders. To assess this, RNA microarray analyses were used to quantify gene expression in peripheral blood cells from 20 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for SAID. Six affected probands with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), six with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), eight with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), and their same-gendered unaffected twins, were enrolled. Comparisons were made between discordant twin pairs and these were also each compared to 40 unrelated control subjects (matched 2:1 to each twin by age, gender and ethnicity) using statistical and molecular pathway analyses. Relative quantitative PCR was used to verify independently measures of differential gene expression assessed by microarray analysis. We found that probands and unrelated, matched controls differed significantly in gene expression for 104 probes corresponding to 92 identifiable genes. Differentially expressed genes involved several pathways including immune responses, signaling, transcription/translation regulators and metabolic functions. Interferon (IFN)-response genes were up-regulated in probands compared to unrelated controls. Many of the abnormally expressed genes played regulatory roles in multiple cellular pathways. In unaffected twins intermediate ordering was observed for 81% of the probes whose expression differed significantly between probands and unrelated controls. Thus, alterations in expression of a limited number of genes may influence the dysregulation of numerous, integrated immune response, cell signaling and regulatory pathways that are common to a number of SAID. Gene expression profiles in peripheral blood also suggest that for genes in these critical pathways, unaffected twins may be in a transitional or intermediate state of immune dysregulation between twins with SAID and unrelated controls, perhaps predisposing them to the development of SAID given the necessary and sufficient environmental exposures.  A group of poorly-understood, life-threatening autoimmune muscle diseases called the myositis syndromes or idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are defined by chronic muscle inflammation and weakness and are associated with specific autoantibodies. The major forms of myositis are polymyositis, in which multiple muscles are affected by inflammation, and dermatomyositis, in which patients also develop skin inflammation. Yet there appear to be other types of myositis based on the clinical presentations, pathology and autoantibodies.  We are studying both the adult (IIM) and juvenile (JIIM) forms of these diseases to understand possible differences in pathogenesis and risk factors.   We enrolled 436 patients with JIIM, including 354 classified as JDM, 33 as JPM, and 49 as JCTM, in a nationwide registry study. The aim of the study was to compare demographics; clinical features; laboratory measures, including myositis autoantibodies; and outcomes among these clinical subgroups, as well as with published data on adult patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) enrolled in a separate natural history study. We used random forest classification and logistic regression modeling to compare clinical subgroups, following univariate analysis. JDM was characterized by typical rashes, including Gottron papules, heliotrope rash, malar rash, periungual capillary changes, and other photosensitive and vasculopathic skin rashes. JPM was characterized by more severe weakness, higher creatine kinase levels, falling episodes, and more frequent cardiac disease. JCTM had more frequent interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgia, and malar rash. Differences in autoantibody frequency were also evident, with anti-p155/140, anti-MJ, and anti-Mi-2 seen more frequently in patients with JDM, anti-signal recognition particle and anti-Jo-1 in JPM, and anti-U1-RNP, PM-Scl, and other myositis-associated autoantibodies more commonly present in JCTM. Mortality was highest in patients with JCTM, whereas hospitalizations and wheelchair use were highest in JPM patients. Several demographic and clinical features were shared between juvenile and adult IIM subgroups. However, JDM and JPM patients had a lower frequency of interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, ""mechanic's hands"" and carpal tunnel syndrome, and lower mortality than their adult counterparts. We conclude that juvenile myositis is a heterogeneous group of illnesses with distinct clinical subgroups, defined by varying clinical and demographic characteristics, laboratory features, and outcomes. n/a",Environmental/genetic Risk Factors and Pathogenesis of Autoimmune Disease,8734131,ZIAES101074,"['12 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Antinuclear Antibodies', 'Area', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood capillaries', 'Body Weight', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Carpal Tunnel Syndrome', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Creatine Kinase', 'Critical Pathways', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Date of birth', 'Dermatomyositis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dust', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogens', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Heart Diseases', 'Herpesvirus Type 3', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indirect Immunofluorescence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Agent', 'Inflammation', 'Interferons', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Mi-2 antibodies', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Natural History', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Onset of illness', 'Organic solvent product', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Polymyositis', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Raynaud Phenomenon', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relative (related person)', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scleroderma', 'Siblings', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Recognition Particle', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Skin', 'Smoking', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Translations', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Water', 'Wheelchairs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'capillary', 'demographics', 'dietary supplements', 'environmental agent', 'falls', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'immune activation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'proband', 'prognostic', 'response', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'young woman']",NIEHS,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES,ZIA,2013,1729206,0.020893951381386174
"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis. The success of this project will be important in bridging statistical machine learning and cancer research.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster. This fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals.

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale.

Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells. The efficacy and biocompatibility (toxicity) of polymers and combination treatments will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo (in mice).

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases. The proposed study is to investigate the fundamentals of neuronal RNA complexity at the systems level, using a combination of high-throughput experimental technologies and novel integrative computational methods.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Functional RNA elements in the human genome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome.  Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease.       This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions. The proposed research will use the latest genomics technologies to reveal functional RNA elements in the human genome, which will provide the molecular basis for many RNA-related human diseases.",Functional RNA elements in the human genome,8326595,R01HG004659,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Award', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cistrons', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exons', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'crosslink', 'empowered', 'functional group', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'mammalian genome', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2012,680000,-0.014497568283716265
"Blood Studies of Endothelial Function and Systemic Inflammation Recent publications are summarized below, adapted from the article's abstracts:  1. A systematic comparison and evaluation of high density exon arrays and RNA-seq technology used to unravel the peripheral blood transcriptome of sickle cell disease.  BACKGROUND: Transcriptomic studies in clinical research are essential tools for deciphering the functional elements of the genome and unraveling underlying disease mechanisms. Various technologies have been developed to deduce and quantify the transcriptome including hybridization and sequencing-based approaches. Recently, high density exon microarrays have been successfully employed for detecting differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing events for biomarker discovery and disease diagnostics. The field of transcriptomics is currently being revolutionized by high throughput DNA sequencing methodologies to map, characterize, and quantify the transcriptome.  METHODS: In an effort to understand the merits and limitations of each of these tools, we undertook a study of the transcriptome in sickle cell disease, a monogenic disease comparing the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST microarray (Exon array) and Illumina's deep sequencing technology (RNA-seq) on whole blood clinical specimens.  RESULTS: Analysis indicated a strong concordance (R&#8201;=&#8201;0.64) between Exon array and RNA-seq data at both gene level and exon level transcript expression. The magnitude of differential expression was found to be generally higher in RNA-seq than in the Exon microarrays. We also demonstrate for the first time the ability of RNA-seq technology to discover novel transcript variants and differential expression in previously unannotated genomic regions in sickle cell disease. In addition to detecting expression level changes, RNA-seq technology was also able to identify sequence variation in the expressed transcripts.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that microarrays remain useful and accurate for transcriptomic analysis of clinical samples with low input requirements, while RNA-seq technology complements and extends microarray measurements for novel discoveries.  2. A novel molecular signature for elevated tricuspid regurgitation velocity in sickle cell disease.  Rationale: An increased tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity (TRV > 2.5 m/s) and pulmonary hypertension defined by right heart catheterization both independently confer increased mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD).   Objectives: We explored the usefulness of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived gene signatures as biomarkers for an elevated TRV in SCD.   Methods: Twenty-seven patients with SCD underwent echocardiography and peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation for expression profiling and 112 patients with SCD were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms.   Measurements and Main Results: Genome-wide gene and miRNA expression profiles were correlated against TRV, yielding 631 transcripts and 12 miRNAs. Support vector machine analysis identified a 10-gene signature including GALNT13 (encoding polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 13) that discriminates patients with and without increased TRV with 100% accuracy. This finding was then validated in a cohort of patients with SCD without (n = 10) and with pulmonary hypertension (n = 10, 90% accuracy). Increased TRV-related miRNAs revealed strong in silico binding predictions of miR-301a to GALNT13 corroborated by microarray analyses demonstrating an inverse correlation between their expression. A genetic association study comparing patients with an elevated (n = 49) versus normal (n = 63) TRV revealed five significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms within GALNT13 (P < 0.005), four trans-acting (P < 2.1  10(-7)) and one cis-acting (P = 0.6  10(-4)) expression quantitative trait locus upstream of the adenosine-A2B receptor gene (ADORA2B).   Conclusions: These studies validate the clinical usefulness of genomic signatures as potential biomarkers and highlight ADORA2B and GALNT13 as potential candidate genes in SCD-associated elevated TRV. n/a",Blood Studies of Endothelial Function and Systemic Inflammation,8557976,ZIAHL006013,"['Adenosine A2B Receptor', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematology', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Chemicals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specimen', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'abstracting', 'cohort', 'density', 'fetal globin', 'genetic association', 'genome-wide', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'member', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'sickling', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'volunteer']",NHLBI,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",ZIA,2012,139167,0.016814196092672193
"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Data and pathways will be posted to our Chr21 Gene Function/Pathway database, http://chr21db.cudenver.edu.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Computational methods for the analysis of RNA-Seq data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technologies for the measurement of mRNA quantities within cells are key components of a biomedical researcher<s toolbox. The characterization of gene expression is important to both the understanding of the molecular biology of the cell and the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. To be most useful to scientists, RNA measurement technologies should be as accurate and precise as possible since even small perturbations in transcript levels may be significant. A recently developed experimental method, RNA-Seq, is promising to revolutionize gene expression analysis and is enabling new discoveries about the human transcriptome. RNA-Seq data demands a significant amount of computation before it can be used and the current computational methods are still in their infancy. We propose to take RNA-Seq computational methods to the next level, increasing both the accuracy of gene expression estimates and the number of scenarios in which it may be used. Using novel probabilistic models and statistical learning techniques, we will enable the technology to precisely measure alternative splicing events and characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms. Our computational methods will be validated with both real and simulated RNA-Seq data and will be made freely available as an open source software package. In addition, we will use the methods we develop to explore differences between the transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. A first application will be the characterization of alternative splicing differences between human embryonic stem cells and differentiated fibroblast cells. A second application will be the estimation of gene expression levels in embryos of the frog Xenopus leaves using the genome sequence of a closely related frog; Xenopus (Silurana) tropical is as a reference. The results of these experiments are expected to advance our understanding of cellular differentiation in vertebrates and, ultimately, the potential for stem cells to be used in the treatment of human diseases and injuries.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to develop computational methods for the support of a technology that measures the quantities of RNA inside of a cell.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.        We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions. Public availability of our system will advance genome-level understanding of human biology and facilitate development of novel drugs, therapies, and personalized medical treatments.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health. n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,8197396,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2012,306196,0.03373841459609863
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach Project Summary/Abstract We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semi- systematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The interplay between the gene expression machinery and the compaction of genetic material into chromatin is now recognized as highly dynamic and complex. These processes must be tightly controlled for normal cellular physiology and to prevent disease states such as cancer. We will use a systems approach to genetically dissect the structural and functional relationships between the highly conserved components of these pathways in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, in order to more easily understand and eventually manipulate the vast complexity of human cells. n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8258763,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histone H4', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,438425,-0.008670560248730776
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs Abstract A most basic difference between cells of the same genotype and different phenotype lies in their transcriptome. Understanding the difference between two transcriptomes in terms of the RNA molecules present in each, or changes in abundance of specific molecules, can offer valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease, development, and specialization. High throughput sequencing provides a unique view of the transcriptome in the form of millions or even billions of short reads of nucleotide sequences sampled from the RNA molecules. To date, nearly 1000 such RNA-seq datasets have already been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Beyond measuring differences in overall expression of genes between samples, there is a critical need to measure differences in expression at the transcript level. Computational tools that can extract significant changes in transcript diversity across populations with RNA-seq are in immediate demand. However, reconstructing the full extent of transcript isoforms from this wealth of data is not a solved problem because of fundamental ambiguities between isoforms at the scale of the short read samples.  We propose a novel approach to the differential analysis of transcriptomes that does not depend on the reconstruction of the full-length transcripts, and yet can accurately pinpoint the variation of transcriptomes. Our techniques are data-driven and applicable to any transcriptome, requiring only a reference genome, and do not depend on a priori gene structure annotations. Our research program builds on our highly sensitive and accurate MapSplice alignment algorithm to construct expression weighted splice graphs (ESG) from RNA-seq datasets. ESGs can be three orders of magnitude smaller in size than current RNA-seq datasets, yet fully represent the substantive biological content of such datasets. The ESG representation supports highly efficient analysis techniques that can directly identify and visualize statistically significant differential transcription between samples. Generalizations of the algorithms are proposed to identify co-regulated splicing patterns that are keys for biological pathway analyses and systems biology analyses.  We have established an ongoing interactive and collaborative research environment among the co-PIs and Co-Is which include the biologists, computer scientists and statistician. The proposed computational methods will be tested and refined using RNA-seq data generated from breast cancer cell lines before being further applied to three well curated RNA-seq datasets on lung cancer pathogenesis, stem cells in leukemia, and equine articular cartilage development and repair (a non-model mammalian organism). Experimental validation of differentially expressed transcript isoforms will both improve the accuracy of our methods, as well as propose novel candidates for alternative isoforms associated with lung cancer,and leukemia diseases, and chondrocyte differentiation.  The software will be open-source and will be developed as a set of components that can be used on their own or integrated into RNA-seq processing workflows. In particular we will integrate the components into the Galaxy cloud computing framework hosted on a local server. As such the methods will be available to researchers worldwide. As components mature they may be installed in other servers worldwide to provide a convenient and secure way to analyze transcriptomes.  Unveiling the dynamics of the transcriptome at modest cost will revolutionize cellular diagnostics and biomedical research. Genome-wide measurement of transcription variants offers the potential for detailed molecular information about cellular identity and function that will greatly expand traditional histological assessment. Cloud-based access to the methods can turn individual laboratories into small genome centers and will enable individual scientists to assess differences among RNA transcriptomes in a matter of days. Our suite of algorithms will enable biomedical researchers to prioritize candidate genes or different gene ontology categories to investigate further for differential transcription and mechanistic importance between experimental conditions. Project Narrative  This project will develop new techniques to compare the transcriptome of different cells, sampled using high-throughput sequencing technology. As the transcriptome consists of the RNA ""instructions"" controlling the cell's functions, differential analysis can provide detailed insight into the difference between healthy and diseased cells, or can be used to more clearly discover the functional differences between, say, liver cells and brain cells.",Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs,8296802,R01HG006272,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer cell line', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Structure', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Hepatocyte', 'High Performance Computing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'articular cartilage', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cartilage development', 'cartilage repair', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'statistics']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2012,425000,0.009272610529714108
"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons.

"Computational Approaches for RNA StructureFunction Determination Discovery and Characterization of a Novel Translational Enhancers3' UTRs of cellular and viral mRNAs harbor elements that function in gene expression by enhancing translation using unknown mechanisms. To determine the function of these elements we previously used the Turnip crinkle virus (TCV). TCV is translated in a cap-independent fashion and contains a 3' region that together with the 5' UTR synergistically enhances translation. We recently discovered another element of this type in the Pea enation mosaic virus, however, this translational enhancer element act in a somewhat different way. We used a set of computational tools, including RNA2D3D for 3D RNA modeling, developed in our lab, and experimental methods to show that this element is T-shaped, which is reminiscent of TCV's similarity to tRNA. We showed that it binds ribosomes and engages in a long range RNA-RNA interaction. Its functionality suggests a means for RNA 5'/3' cyclization and thus a mechanism for translational enhancement. It appears that the existence of these novel elements is suggesting alternate translational mechanisms that may be found in eukaryotic organisms.Characteristics that Determine Abundance of Two-Thirds of Proteins in a Human Cell LineTranscription, mRNA decay, translation, and protein degradation all contribute to steady state protein concentrations in multi-cellular eukaryotes. In this research, experimental and computational studies were done to determine the absolute protein and mRNA abundances in cellular lysates from the human Daoy medulloblastoma cell line, and the properties that contributed to these abundances. Sequence features related to translation and protein degradation explained two-thirds of protein abundance variation. mRNA sequence lengths, amino acid properties, upstream open reading frames and secondary structures in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) showed the strongest individual correlations for protein concentrations. In a combined model, characteristics of the coding region and the 3'UTR explained a larger proportion of protein abundance variation than characteristics of the 5'UTR.Cis Acting Elements in the 3' UTR of Dengue VirusOver 50 million case of dengue fever are reported each year with 10% leading to severe forms of the disease. Using our massively parallel genetic algorithm for RNA folding we showed that the core region of the 3' untranslated region of dengue virus RNA can form 2 dumbell structures of unequal frequencies of occurrence. It was experimentally shown that structural motifs formed from these dumbells are important for viral replication. Also it was shown that there is a cooperative synergy with both dumbells for translation. Thus, the cis-acting elements in the core region of dengue virus are required for both replication and optimal translation.Correlating SHAPE Signatures with 3D RNA StructuresSelective 2-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) is a relatively easy technique for the quantitative analysis of RNA secondary structure. Low SHAPE signal values are correlated with Watson-Crick base pairing, and high values indicate positions that are single-stranded within the RNA structure. The relationship of the measured SHAPE signal to structural properties such as non-Watson-Crick base pairing has thus far not been thoroughly investigated. In this research we present results of SHAPE experiments performed on a set of seven RNAs with published 3D structures. We found that the RNA SHAPE signal depends on the type of base pairs a nucleotide is involved in, its ability to stack and its context. This is important for improving computational/experimental methods for RNA structure prediction.The Role of Ions and Flanking Bases in the Dimerization of HIV-1Experimentally it has been shown that the characterization of HIV-1 kissing loop formation differs depending on the subtype of the virus. It has been shown that subtype-B monomers dimerize at high salt concentrations or in the presence of magnesium ions while subtype-A monomers will only dimerize with a magnesium ion bound to the flanking G273 phosphate group or the phosphate group of G274 regardless of the salt concentration. We found using computer simulations that at low concentrations both types of monomer hairpin loops were significantly deformed and the bases in the hairpin loop that are associated with dimerization were turned inward. At high salt concentrations the subtype-B monomer maintained a shape conducive to dimerization, while subtype-A still showed significant deformations. Also the flanking bases in subtype-B helped to stabilize the conformation while the flanking base G273 in subtype-A caused deformation. However, when magnesium ions were present and bound to the G273 or G274 phosphate groups, base G273 maintained a conformation that stabilized the loop for dimerization. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms that are involved in the HIV-1 virus life cycle.Classifying Pre-miRNA via Combinatorial Feature Mining and BoostingMicroRNAs are non-coding RNAs consisting of about 22 nucleotides that are derived from precursor molecules. These precursors usually fold into stem-loop hairpin structures. When scanning genomes it is difficult to distinguish false positive pre-miRNAs from the real thing. In this research a new method was developed for identifying and classifying pre-miRNAs. A combinatorial feature mining approach was used to discover a good set of features. These feature sets were then used to train support vector machines to obtain classification models. A boosting algorithm was then applied to further enhance the accuracy. Results indicate significant improvement over previous methods.Data Mining of Functional RNA Structures in Genomic SequencesThe normal functions of genomes depend on the precise expression of mRNAs and ncRNAs, such as microRNAs. These ncRNAs and functional RNA structures (FRSs) act as regulators or response elements for cellular factors, participate in transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and translation. In RNA-based regulation, the regulatory RNAs are often correlated with distinct higher-order structures. Computational simulations indicated that a large number of FRSs are significantly more structured and thermodynamically stable. Various computational tools have been developed and the structural features of ncRNAs and FRSs have been determined. We report our efforts in the computational discovery of structured features of ncRNAs and FRSs within complex genomes.Discovering Common Folding Patterns in two RNA SequencesAn efficient dynamic programming algorithm was developed that uses ordered labeled trees for discovering the largest common RNA substructures given 2 RNA sequences. This algorithm can also be used to discover repeated regions of RNA secondary structure.Characterizing Structural Features for Small Regulatory RNAs in E. ColiSmall regulatory RNAs are highly abundant noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) found in bacterial genomes. These small regulatory ncRNAs (sRNAs) can regulate the synthesis of proteins by mediating mRNA transcription, translation and stability. Furthermore, they also control the activity of specific proteins by binding to them. In this research, we describe a general computational approach for identifying the distinct structure of sRNAs in the Escherichia coli (E. coli) genomes by a quantitative measure that is the energy difference between the optimal structure folded from a sequence segment and its corresponding optimal restrained structure where all base pairings formed in the original optimal structure are excluded. Our results indicated that most of the known small ncRNAs in E. coli K12 have high statistical structural significance and are thermodynamically stable. n/a",Computational Approaches for RNA StructureFunction Determination,8552600,ZIABC008382,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Acylation', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Base Pairing', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cyclization', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Virus', 'Development', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli K12', 'Eukaryota', 'Frequencies', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'HIV', 'HIV-1', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Individual', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Length', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primer Extension', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Folding', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Response Elements', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training Support', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translating', 'Translation Process', 'Translations', 'Trees', 'Turnip - dietary', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cis acting element', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'drug development', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inorganic phosphate', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Expression', 'magnesium ion', 'medulloblastoma cell line', 'monomer', 'novel', 'pea enation mosaic virus', 'pre-miRNA', 'programs', 'protein degradation', 'research study', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'viral RNA', 'web site']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2012,451557,-0.014704847028577809
"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster.

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1. Software engineering, testing, and documentation of the HyPhy codebase. 2. The development of a high-performance engine for phylogenetic maximum likelihood model fitting and inference. 3.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position.

"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,8113231,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2011,119416,0.02343708642634264
"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Functional RNA elements in the human genome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome.  Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Data and pathways will be posted to our Chr21 Gene Function/Pathway database, http://chr21db.cudenver.edu.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.            The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology.

"Computational methods for the analysis of RNA-Seq data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technologies for the measurement of mRNA quantities within cells are key components of a biomedical researcher<s toolbox. The characterization of gene expression is important to both the understanding of the molecular biology of the cell and the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. To be most useful to scientists, RNA measurement technologies should be as accurate and precise as possible since even small perturbations in transcript levels may be significant. A recently developed experimental method, RNA-Seq, is promising to revolutionize gene expression analysis and is enabling new discoveries about the human transcriptome. RNA-Seq data demands a significant amount of computation before it can be used and the current computational methods are still in their infancy. We propose to take RNA-Seq computational methods to the next level, increasing both the accuracy of gene expression estimates and the number of scenarios in which it may be used. Using novel probabilistic models and statistical learning techniques, we will enable the technology to precisely measure alternative splicing events and characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms. Our computational methods will be validated with both real and simulated RNA-Seq data and will be made freely available as an open source software package. In addition, we will use the methods we develop to explore differences between the transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. A first application will be the characterization of alternative splicing differences between human embryonic stem cells and differentiated fibroblast cells. A second application will be the estimation of gene expression levels in embryos of the frog Xenopus leaves using the genome sequence of a closely related frog; Xenopus (Silurana) tropical is as a reference. The results of these experiments are expected to advance our understanding of cellular differentiation in vertebrates and, ultimately, the potential for stem cells to be used in the treatment of human diseases and injuries.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to develop computational methods for the support of a technology that measures the quantities of RNA inside of a cell.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials. We propose to study novel methods for analyzing the large-scale biomedical data to realize their full potential of molecular diagnosis and prognosis of transplant rejection prediction for critical early treatment.          n/a",Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data,8079474,R01GM083345,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Experimental Designs', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Graft Rejection', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer microarray', 'cancer type', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney allograft', 'method development', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'theories', 'transplant database', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,250488,0.022390285653518034
"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,8012280,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2011,306343,0.03485644610016973
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8063104,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histone H4', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2011,460136,-0.0071149932302649556
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction.

"HyPhy: Molecular Evolutionary Analyses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Description HyPhy (http://www.hyphy.org) is a scriptable software platform designed to enable flexible and powerful analyses of DNA, RNA, codon, amino acid and other types of sequence data in an evolutionary context. Such analyses have become an indispensable component of most research studies that make use of comparative genomic data. Biologists and bioinformaticians increasingly recognize the benefits of molecular evolutionary analyses. Since its initial release in 2001, HyPhy has become a relatively stable and mature product, and has been downloaded by more than 4,500 unique users, integrated into several popular web-based genomic data analysis servers, cited in over 400 peer-reviewed publications and described in three book chapters, in spite of the fact that the development of the package has never been directly funded. This proposal seeks support to improve the quality, performance, reliability, modularity, documentation and feature sets of the HyPhy system. Specific aims can be divided into four major areas: 1.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control.

"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,7895558,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2010,116662,0.02343708642634264
"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks. We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process. But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment scheme.",Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin,7865088,R01GM093156,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Heel', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune response', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Problem Formulations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell behavior', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'design', 'driving force', 'environmental change', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'grasp', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'software systems', 'sound', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,460864,-0.0023335971169930235
"Computational methods for the analysis of RNA-Seq data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technologies for the measurement of mRNA quantities within cells are key components of a biomedical researcher<s toolbox. The characterization of gene expression is important to both the understanding of the molecular biology of the cell and the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. To be most useful to scientists, RNA measurement technologies should be as accurate and precise as possible since even small perturbations in transcript levels may be significant. A recently developed experimental method, RNA-Seq, is promising to revolutionize gene expression analysis and is enabling new discoveries about the human transcriptome. RNA-Seq data demands a significant amount of computation before it can be used and the current computational methods are still in their infancy. We propose to take RNA-Seq computational methods to the next level, increasing both the accuracy of gene expression estimates and the number of scenarios in which it may be used. Using novel probabilistic models and statistical learning techniques, we will enable the technology to precisely measure alternative splicing events and characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms. Our computational methods will be validated with both real and simulated RNA-Seq data and will be made freely available as an open source software package. In addition, we will use the methods we develop to explore differences between the transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. A first application will be the characterization of alternative splicing differences between human embryonic stem cells and differentiated fibroblast cells. A second application will be the estimation of gene expression levels in embryos of the frog Xenopus leaves using the genome sequence of a closely related frog; Xenopus (Silurana) tropical is as a reference. The results of these experiments are expected to advance our understanding of cellular differentiation in vertebrates and, ultimately, the potential for stem cells to be used in the treatment of human diseases and injuries.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to develop computational methods for the support of a technology that measures the quantities of RNA inside of a cell.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7810583,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,467448,-0.0071149932302649556
"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials. We propose to study novel methods for analyzing the large-scale biomedical data to realize their full potential of molecular diagnosis and prognosis of transplant rejection prediction for critical early treatment.          n/a",Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data,7858165,R01GM083345,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Experimental Designs', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Graft Rejection', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer microarray', 'cancer type', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney allograft', 'method development', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'theories', 'transplant database', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2010,253269,0.022390285653518034
"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,7713981,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bite', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2010,319254,0.03485644610016973
"The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomics Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Asthma affects over 17 million people in the United States, and is a significant cause of morbidity.   Development of novel therapies to reduce asthma burden is a major priority of the scientific community, yet such studies are often hampered by the limited availability of clinically relevant biologic samples for investigation. The primary objective of this proposal is to establish the Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research, an open-access collection of immortalized cell lines, cDNA and DNA, and an accompanying complementary dataset for these samples consisting of extensive phenotype data, and genome-wide SNP genotype, gene expression, and methylation data from more than 2,700 well-characterized subjects participating in ongoing genetic and genomic studies of asthma. This Asthma BioRepository will be established through the EVE Consortium, a collaborative effort consisting of U.S. investigators from 11 academic centers who have conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma. The EVE cohorts together total more than 30,000 subjects with genome-wide SNP data and provide broad representation of the North American asthmatic population. The Asthma BioRepository will be developed through the following three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, blood samples and asthma-relevant primary cell types (including CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, alveolar macrophages, and lung biopsy specimens) will be collected for gene expression profiling and DNA methylation studies. Lymphoblastic cell lines will also established. Specific Aim 2 focuses on the development of an accompanying database consisting of genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles for all of the collected samples and   25% of the immortalized cell lines to facilitate comprehensive integrative genomic analysis. This database will be linked to clinical and genome-wide genotype data (in dbGAP), and together with the collected biological specimens and cell lines, the totality of the Asthma BioRepository will be submitted to the NHLBI Biologic Specimen Repository and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC) for distribution to the scientific community. Specific Aim 3 will use the developed database to perform comprehensive integrative genomic analyses to identify the regulatory genetic variation critical to asthma pathogenesis. These studies will include expression profiling of asthma severity; genome-wide expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping; comparison of gene expression profiles and identified eQTLs across asthma-relevant tissues; and genomewide association studies of methylation patterns in asthma. Results of these studies will be submitted to dbGAP and linked to the Asthma BioRepository database to provide investigators with preliminary candidate loci for future investigation. The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research will represent the largest collection of asthma-related biological materials and genomic data in the world, and an invaluable resource for asthma researchers everywhere.      (End of Abstract)           Project Narrative The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research would represent the largest collection of asthma cell lines and accompanying biologic data in the world and would facilitate comprehensive, large-scale molecular analysis in some of the best-characterized asthma populations in existence. A centralized biorepository of asthma-related biological samples and viable cell lines from more than 2,700 representative asthmatics would provide the scientific community with an unprecedented source of materials to support ongoing and future investigations and functional studies of the molecular determinants of asthma susceptibility, its natural history, and pharmacogenetics.

"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7896417,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'information processing', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2010,332561,-0.013055939959410826
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7910601,SC1AI080579,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2010,240491,0.011909241121172299
"Biological Characterization of Genetic Mechanisms in Neuropsychiatric Disorders It is widely assumed that risk for most common medical disorders, especially for psychiatric disorders, involves interactions between multiple genes and between genes and the environment. Methods for testing and confirming epistasis in clinical samples, particularly the higher order interactions likely important in schizophrenia, are still being developed, and will mature as large scale datasets become available. Our Investigators have developed neuroimaging methods to confirm at a biological level clinical evidence of epistatic interactions within genes and between genes and have extended these findings to signaling within lymphoblast cell lines and in animal models involving breeding of genetically altered mouse strains. Our Clinical Study Section investigators continue to test specific hypotheses about gene-environment interactions, such as whether obstetrical complications related to hypoxic stress, long implicated as a risk factor for the development of adult schizophrenia, interact with genes involved in or affected by hypoxic-ischemic injury. Through the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch we have access to a large sample of probands, healthy siblings and healthy controls, which allows us to differentiate between state and potential trait clinical phenomena, it also permits an investigation of the genetics of protection within a family.   In examining gene interactions, Ji et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2010) studied the role of the gene dysbindin (DTNBP1) in dopamine receptor trafficking and cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function. Genetic variants in DTNBP1 have been associated with schizophrenia. Patients have a reduced expression of dysbindin mRNA and protein in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. It is unclear the role of dysbindin in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia or in neuron function in the circuitry underlying psychosis and related behaviors, but researchers are investigating its physiological role in neuronal function. They have found that downregulated dysbindin in cultured neurons leads to decreases in levels of Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) and extracellular glutamate or dopamine. Our research used dysbindin knockout mice, from the Sandy mouse line to study its role in dopamine signaling and neuronal function in the prefrontal cortex. There is reported evidence of increased dopamine D2 receptor but not D1 on neuronal cell surface in cortex. Our findings showed a disruption of dysbindin resulted in a marked decrease in the excitability of fast-spiking GABA interneurons in prefrontal cortex and striatum. The knockout mice also exhibited decreased inhibitory input to pyramidal neurons in layer V of the prefrontal cortex. The increased D2 signaling in the knockout mice fast-spiking interneurons was associated with increased neuronal firing in response to D2 agonist compared with the interneuron firing in wild-type mice neurons. We concluded that these results are evidence that dysbindin regulates prefrontal cortex function through D2-mediated modulation of GABA function.  Another project of gene-gene interaction is presented in Nicodemus et al. (Human Genetic, 2010) who reported biological validation with functional neuroimaging of statistical epistasis between the genes DISC1, CIT (Citron Rho-interacting kinase) and NDEL1 (Nuclear distribution protein nudE-like 1). Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a schizophrenia risk susceptibility gene that encodes a protein, which interacts with many other proteins, such as CIT and NDEL1. Many of its interacting proteins have been associated with psychosis. Epistasis between the genes was tested in a schizophrenia case-control study using Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs). These analyses revealed a subset of 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that underwent 2 SNP interaction modeling using ratio tests for nested unconditional logistic regression models. Of the 21 interactions, 7 were significant and of those 3 interactions were validated via fMRI study in healthy controls; risk associated alleles at both SNPs predicted prefrontal cortical inefficiency during a working memory task, a schizophrenia-linked intermediate biological phenotype. We failed to statistically replicate the interactions in other clinical samples. However, we did find that the CIT SNPs were located near the region that encodes the DISC1 interaction domain. Also, a DISC1 SNP acts as a splicing enhancer and the NDEL SNP is proximal to the encoding region of NDEL, which interacts with DISC1 proteins. Altogether, these results strongly suggest a biological basis for epistasis signals validated by fMRI.  Studying the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in the context of other genes related to schizophrenia is a starting point to move beyond the cell surface in a neurotransmitter system critically important in cognition and psychosis. The work in this project has produced many insights for future projects related to cortical function in schizophrenia and DA influenced pathways. We are continuing to delve further into molecular and physiologic studies of the COMT mice. These studies are focused at: 1) identifying novel molecular targets in developing cortex dysregulated by genetic alteration in COMT and in further characterization of the effects on cortical microcircuit function; 2) working in collaboration to cross breed COMT mice with AKT1 (encodes serine/threonine-specific protein kinase) heterozygote knockout mice, with the goal of identifying molecular targets of COMT-AKT1 interactions suggested by clinical work; and 3) exploring other epistasis models by cross breeding between COMT genetic mouse models with mice having perturbations in other potentially interacting genes, e.g. GAD1 (glutamate decarboxylase 1), GRM3 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 3), KCNH2 (potassium voltage-gated channel). These complex genetic alterations are expected to be more powerful in testing specific hypotheses about interactions between these genes and in uncovering novel pathways dysregulated by these interactions than in diverse clinical populations. n/a",Biological Characterization of Genetic Mechanisms in Neuropsychiatric Disorders,8158148,ZIAMH002904,"['Biological', 'Disease', 'Genetic', 'neuropsychiatry']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2010,1739556,-0.013891435564675429
"Transcriptional co-regulators in epidermis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The stratified mammalian epidermis develops from somatic ectoderm by the progressive addition and differentiation of superficial epidermal layers (1). After the initial morphogenesis, the epidermis is maintained by homeostatic mechanisms whereby keratinocytes move from the proliferating basal cell layer towards the surface as they undergo a series of differentiation steps, ultimately undergoing cell death. One role of keratinocyte differentiation is the formation of an effective permeability barrier, which depends on the regulated expression of a large battery of genes encoding components of the cornified and granular layers (2). Under funding by the parent grant, we are using molecular biology to investigate the role of a single transcription factor, the Grainyhead-like transcription factor Get1/Grhl3 (3-5), in epidermal differentiation. In contrast, in this revision application, we propose a systems biology approach to computationally generate transcriptional regulatory network for the process of epidermal differentiation. Thus, this application leads to a new direction and differs from the parent grant in two important ways: First, it expands the scope of the study to transcriptional regulatory networks in epidermal development in general, and second, it incorporates the methods of systems biology; thus the application is consistent with one of the key emphasis areas of this RFA (Developmental Biology - Systems biology). The specific goals are to: 1) Generate global gene expression data over the time course of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation; and 2) Use the time course gene expression data from 1, other genome-wide expression data, DNA motif information, functional annotation, and literature mining to infer transcriptional networks in epidermal differentiation. The goal of this project is also to build a new interdisciplinary team between the Andersen laboratory, whose primary expertise is in molecular/developmental biology, and Alex Ihler, a new assistant professor whose primary expertise is in graphical models, Bayesian inference methods, machine learning, and data mining. The contributions of the Ihler group -- the mathematical modeling required to define the networks -- will allow approaches and advances in our understanding of epidermal differentiation that would not be attainable without this collaboration.               Defective epidermal differentiation and disrupted barrier formation are salient features of several skin diseases, including childhood eczema and psoriasis. With the definition of networks important for these processes, we expect to discover new diagnostic approaches and treatment targets.",Transcriptional co-regulators in epidermis,7776854,R01AR044882,"['Area', 'Basal Cell', 'Cell Death', 'Childhood', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Ectoderm', 'Eczema', 'Epidermis', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morphogenesis', 'Permeability', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Psoriasis', 'Role', 'Series', 'Stratum Granulosum', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'data mining', 'genome-wide', 'keratinocyte', 'keratinocyte differentiation', 'mathematical model', 'novel diagnostics', 'parent grant', 'professor', 'skin disorder', 'text searching', 'time use', 'transcription factor']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2009,146526,-0.02905618059062509
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.)

"Micro RNA Profiling in Pediatric Cancers 1. Identify microRNA profiles that are good biomarkers of pediatric cancers. 2.    Identify microRNA that are biomarkers for predicting prognosis. 3. Identify genomic context of    microRNA expression, and how they correlate with mRNA expression 4. Identify miRNAs in    genomically altered regions that control critical genes in neuroblastoma. 5. Functional    validation of selected miRNAs 6. Mutational screening of microRNAs MicroRNAs are recently    discovered small, non-coding RNA molecules encoded in the genomes of plants and animals. These    highly conserved, 21-mer RNAs regulate the expression of genes by binding to their    3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of specific mRNAs, causing translational inhibition or mRNA    degradation. As many mRNAs may share this short sequence, microRNAs are capable of    simultaneously influence the expression of a large set of genes. It is estimated that each    microRNA can target hundreds of genes, and multiple microRNAs can target a single gene. So far    710 microRNAs (version 11.0) have been reported to be expressed in human cells    (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/). Due to their regulatory roles in gene expression, there is    increasing evidence that microRNAs are directly involved not only in normal embryogenesis,    metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, but also in pathogenesis of human    cancers. Because most pediatric malignancies are developmental tumors, i.e., they arise from    aberrant differentiation, we hypothesized that pediatric tumors will exhibit cancer and tissue    specific microRNA expression profiles that may be associated with development and the    tumorigenic process, which can be used in diagnosis and prognosis. In this study we    investigate the expression profiles of microRNAs for a panel of pediatric cell lines and tumor    xenografts for which mRNAs profiles were, and which are currently used as pediatric    pre-clinical models for drug screening. Using this panel of samples representing 10 different    types of pediatric tumors we explore if pediatric tumors differentially express microRNAs    according to their diagnosis by performing microRNA profiling on in-house microRNA arrays. We    use machine learning algorithm and statistical to identify microRNAs that can potentially be    used as biomarkers for these cancer types. We will validate these findings on independent NB    and RMS tumor samples. In addition, we explore the degree of co-regulation of the microRNAs    with the host gene within which they are located. We are also investigate key microRNAs that    are biologically relevant and can be used as prognostic markers in RMS. n/a",Micro RNA Profiling in Pediatric Cancers,7965928,ZIABC011001,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Embryonic Development', 'Exhibits', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Plant Genome', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Tissues', 'Translational Repression', 'Validation', 'cancer type', 'cell growth', 'mRNA Expression', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'outcome forecast', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft', 'tumorigenic']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2009,129767,0.0034731675123374477

"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"Advanced Methods In Statistical Genetics Statistical models for genetics data are often surprisingly challenging, and often require advanced and new statistical methods. This project continues to investigate a number of such areas, including, for example, a global analysis of X-chromosome dosage compensation. We begin by noting that Drosophila has a special dosage compensation complex, which upregulates the male X chromosome about two-fold relative to the autosomes, thus maintaining X-versus-autosomal genic balance. However, this complex is only present in the soma, not in the germline. Nevertheless, germline tissues also display striking two-fold upregulation of genes on the male X-chromosome, as revealed by careful measurements of gene expression using microarrays (Gupta, Malley, Oliver, et al., 2006). Analysis of published data from mouse and worm expression arrays reveals a similar balance between X and autosomal genes. Taken together, these results (with  indicate that multiple means have evolved to achieve the same end) emphasize our fundamental ignorance of the underlying transcription-linked process that is being regulated. We note that this paper by Gupta, Malley, Oliver, et al. (J. Biology, Feb. 2006) was accessed more than 8,500 times in the year following its appearance in Feburary 2006, and was the third most accessed paper in this journal over that time period. More recently we have undertaken the study of genome wide associations and how statistical learning machines can be applied to such ultra large data (500K or 1,000K snps), with the aim of locating the most predictive genes or snps among the available features and understanding how linkage disequilibrium compromises or assists these detection methods. n/a",Advanced Methods In Statistical Genetics,7966730,ZIACT000268,"['Accounting', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Drosophila genus', 'Employee Strikes', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Paper', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Up-Regulation', 'X Chromosome', 'autosome', 'genome wide association study', 'male', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel strategies']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIA,2009,316553,0.0037136972669790237
"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Data and pathways will be posted to our Chr21 Gene Function/Pathway database, http://chr21db.cudenver.edu.

"The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        This competing renewal application requests five years of support for the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD): The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior. The Surgeon General notes, that 30,000 suicides per year in the United States and ten times that number of suicide attempts, requires a response that involves improving our knowledge regarding the relative importance of multiple predictors of suicide risk. The CCNMD employs a multidisciplinary approach to develop a predictive and explanatory model for suicidal behavior. Project 1: In the brainstem of depressed suicides we have found more serotonin neurons, more TPH, less serotonin transporter expression and 5-HT1A binding, all effects that enhance activity. The brainstem changes may be a response to less serotonin input and lower neurodensity in ventral prefrontal cortex of suicide and that may underlie increased impulsivity and suicide risk. We plan to map the circuitry of suicide by adding studies of anterior cingulate and amygdala, and to study neuron survival in prefrontal cortex. Project 2: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome in the same brain regions as Project 1 will map altered gene expression and be compared to murine models in Projects 6 and 7. Project 3: CCNMD investigators have successfully tested a predictive stress-diathesis model where suicidal ideation is a proximal predictor and lifetime aggressivity/impulsivity is a trait predictor of suicide attempts in major depression. We now propose to evaluate potential causal factors (genes and adverse childhood experiences) and an intermediate biological phenotype, the HPA axis in a prospective study. Project 4: We will use PET to determine whether the postmortem receptor changes differentially associated with major depression and suicide can be distinguished in vivo. Effects of susceptibility gene expression on binding to 5-HTT, 5-HTiA and MAOA will be determined by PET and related to depression and suicidal behavior. Project 5 builds on our familial transmission results. This bottom-up familial transmission study will examine suicidality, aggression/impulsivity, serotonin susceptibility genes, and psychopathology in very high-risk families with depressed adolescent attempter probands. Projects 6 and 7 involve murine models of depression and aggression related to single genes and an inbred strain. Effects of altered gene expression at critical phases and of maternal deprivation on behavior, brain morphology, gene expression profiles, neurogenesis and biochemistry will be evaluated and compared with clinical findings. Project 8 proposed use of statistical model selection for suicide prediction and analysis of large postmortem and in vivo imaging data sets using statistical learning theory that allows the flexible fitting of models with many predictors.       n/a",The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior,7640534,P50MH062185,"['Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strain', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Maternal Deprivation', 'Mental disorders', 'Methaqualone', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Serotonin', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Surgeon', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'brain morphology', 'depressed', 'depression', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurogenesis', 'proband', 'receptor', 'response', 'serotonin transporter', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P50,2009,2127235,0.020368196887176636
"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,7507028,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bite', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2009,322622,0.03485644610016973
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7629191,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,448088,-0.0071149932302649556
"The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomics Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Asthma affects over 17 million people in the United States, and is a significant cause of morbidity.   Development of novel therapies to reduce asthma burden is a major priority of the scientific community, yet such studies are often hampered by the limited availability of clinically relevant biologic samples for investigation. The primary objective of this proposal is to establish the Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research, an open-access collection of immortalized cell lines, cDNA and DNA, and an accompanying complementary dataset for these samples consisting of extensive phenotype data, and genome-wide SNP genotype, gene expression, and methylation data from more than 2,700 well-characterized subjects participating in ongoing genetic and genomic studies of asthma. This Asthma BioRepository will be established through the EVE Consortium, a collaborative effort consisting of U.S. investigators from 11 academic centers who have conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma. The EVE cohorts together total more than 30,000 subjects with genome-wide SNP data and provide broad representation of the North American asthmatic population. The Asthma BioRepository will be developed through the following three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, blood samples and asthma-relevant primary cell types (including CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, alveolar macrophages, and lung biopsy specimens) will be collected for gene expression profiling and DNA methylation studies. Lymphoblastic cell lines will also established. Specific Aim 2 focuses on the development of an accompanying database consisting of genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles for all of the collected samples and   25% of the immortalized cell lines to facilitate comprehensive integrative genomic analysis. This database will be linked to clinical and genome-wide genotype data (in dbGAP), and together with the collected biological specimens and cell lines, the totality of the Asthma BioRepository will be submitted to the NHLBI Biologic Specimen Repository and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC) for distribution to the scientific community. Specific Aim 3 will use the developed database to perform comprehensive integrative genomic analyses to identify the regulatory genetic variation critical to asthma pathogenesis. These studies will include expression profiling of asthma severity; genome-wide expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping; comparison of gene expression profiles and identified eQTLs across asthma-relevant tissues; and genomewide association studies of methylation patterns in asthma. Results of these studies will be submitted to dbGAP and linked to the Asthma BioRepository database to provide investigators with preliminary candidate loci for future investigation. The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research will represent the largest collection of asthma-related biological materials and genomic data in the world, and an invaluable resource for asthma researchers everywhere.      (End of Abstract)           Project Narrative The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research would represent the largest collection of asthma cell lines and accompanying biologic data in the world and would facilitate comprehensive, large-scale molecular analysis in some of the best-characterized asthma populations in existence.

"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7646234,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'information processing', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2009,335920,-0.013055939959410826
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7669377,SC1AI080579,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2009,240426,0.011909241121172299
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.)

"Micro RNA Profiling in Pediatric Cancers 1. Identify microRNA profiles that are good biomarkers of pediatric cancers. 2.       Identify microRNA that are biomarkers for predicting prognosis. 3. Identify genomic context of       microRNA expression, and how they correlate with mRNA expression 4. Identify miRNAs in       genomically altered regions that control critical genes in neuroblastoma. 5. Functional       validation of selected miRNAs 6. Mutational screening of microRNAs MicroRNAs are recently       discovered small, non-coding RNA molecules encoded in the genomes of plants and animals. These       highly conserved, 21-mer RNAs regulate the expression of genes by binding to their       3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of specific mRNAs, causing translational inhibition or mRNA       degradation. As many mRNAs may share this short sequence, microRNAs are capable of       simultaneously influence the expression of a large set of genes. It is estimated that each       microRNA can target hundreds of genes, and multiple microRNAs can target a single gene. So far       710 microRNAs (version 11.0) have been reported to be expressed in human cells       (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/). Due to their regulatory roles in gene expression, there is       increasing evidence that microRNAs are directly involved not only in normal embryogenesis,       metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, but also in pathogenesis of human       cancers. Because most pediatric malignancies are developmental tumors, i.e., they arise from       aberrant differentiation, we hypothesized that pediatric tumors will exhibit cancer and tissue       specific microRNA expression profiles that may be associated with development and the       tumorigenic process, which can be used in diagnosis and prognosis. In this study we       investigate the expression profiles of microRNAs for a panel of pediatric cell lines and tumor       xenografts for which mRNAs profiles were, and which are currently used as pediatric       pre-clinical models for drug screening. Using this panel of samples representing 10 different       types of pediatric tumors we explore if pediatric tumors differentially express microRNAs       according to their diagnosis by performing microRNA profiling on in-house microRNA arrays. We       use machine learning algorithm and statistical to identify microRNAs that can potentially be       used as biomarkers for these cancer types. We will validate these findings on independent NB       and RMS tumor samples.

"Functional Genomic Study of Aging and Aging Interventions Aging is a fundamental biological process that is influenced by a number of genetic and environmental factors. Lifespan is one of the few reliable parameters to measure the rate of aging. Genetic analyses of model organisms have uncovered mutations in a number of genes that can affect lifespan. Changes in gene expression in aging have been observed in a number of organisms, including worms, flies, rodents, primates and human beings. However, little is known about how different tissues age, and how longevity genes and prolongevity interventions influence aging. To address tissue-specific aging, we previously have identified hundreds of genes showing significant changes at the transcript level in aging in seven different tissues, including brain, muscle and tissues in the digestive and reproductive systems, which represent different physiological functions. This survey has provided us a foundation to address several basic questions in aging. First, we have started to address the mechanisms of lifespan extension by the longevity genes at the tissue and molecular levels. We have identified hundreds of genes showing tissue-specific changes between the wild type and a long-lived fly strain, methuselah. This assessment elucidates molecular and cellular mechanisms on how the methuselah gene regulates lifespan at the tissue level. Second, we have investigated what are the common and different changes in aging among different tissues. Using a machine learning algorithm, we have found that most of the age-related changes are tissue-specific. The mitochondrial energy production is the only biological process showing significant changes with age in all the tissues, further confirming the current view on the importance of mitochondrial functions in aging. Similar approaches will be applied to study mechanisms by which prolongevity interventions extend lifespan at the tissue levels in the future. We will further investigate which age-related genes and pathways are important in regulating lifespan in D. melanogaster.   A robust environmental manipulation of lifespan is dietary restriction (DR), which has been shown to extend lifespan in many species, ranging from invertebrates to mammals. However, it would be challenging to impose long-term DR in humans. An alternative strategy would be to apply pharmaceutical or nutraceutical compounds to induce responses that would mimic DR. A few compounds have been shown to have this effect in model organisms. However, the number is still small and little is known about mechanisms by which these compounds extend lifespan. Dietary supplements are widely used with the belief that they can forestall disease and increase longevity. Few systematic attempts have been made to confirm prolongevity claims made or to investigate potentially effective interventions. We have developed several prolongevity screen systems and have assessed the effects of supplementation of more than a dozen of compounds on lifespan in the mexfly. This screen has been conducted in the Moscafrut mass-rearing facility at Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico. We have shown that resveratrol can extend lifespan of the mexflies only under certain nutritional conditions, suggesting the prolongevity effect of resveratrol depends on dietary composition and content.   Consumption of cranberry has been shown to have a numerous health benefits, especially on fighting against urinary tract infection. However, not much is known about anti-aging effects of cranberry. Therefore, we have decided to assess the anti-aging effects of cranberry extracts in rats. We have found that long-term supplementation of cranberry can delay some age-related decline of physiological functions, including glucose metabolism. This result encourages us to investigate additional health benefits of cranberry consumption related to aging, which will provide scientific guidance to cranberry consumption.  In summary, we have utilized multi-species to address issues related to lifespan regulation by taking advantage of unique features of each system. With D. melanogaster, we are studying mechanisms by which prolongevity interventions and longevity genes extend lifespan at molecular and tissue levels. We are using the mexflies to identify effective prolongevity interventions, which will be further assessed in rodents. This multi-species approach should prove valuable to advance the objective of Laboratory of Experimental Gerontology to investigate and develop aging interventions in mammals. Identification of the conserved features in aging and efficient prolongevity interventions are clearly valuable for understanding human aging and more importantly for developing efficient aging intervention strategies for humans. n/a",Functional Genomic Study of Aging and Aging Interventions,7732209,Z01AG000365,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Anastrepha ludens', 'Animal Model', 'Belief', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Condition', 'Consumption', 'Cranberries', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mexico', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Nutraceutical', 'Nutritional', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Primates', 'Production', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Reproductive system', 'Resveratrol', 'Rodent', 'Supplementation', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urinary tract infection', 'age effect', 'age related', 'anti aging', 'dietary restriction', 'dietary supplements', 'fight against', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'glucose metabolism', 'longevity gene', 'response']",NIA,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,Z01,2008,454199,-0.0128461263034239
"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics,7350919,R01HG003354,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Class', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Today', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'computer program', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'size', 'software development', 'statistics']",NHGRI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2008,298801,0.004492445772756707
"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,7473948,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2008,122190,0.02343708642634264
"Advanced Methods In Statistical Genetics Statistical models for genetics data are often surprisingly challenging, and often require advanced and new statistical methods. This project continues to investigate a number of such areas, including, for example, a global analysis of X-chromosome dosage compensation. We begin by noting that Drosophila has a special dosage compensation complex, which upregulates the male X chromosome about two-fold relative to the autosomes, thus maintaining X-versus-autosomal genic balance. However, this complex is only present in the soma, not in the germline. Nevertheless, germline tissues also display striking two-fold upregulation of genes on the male X-chromosome, as revealed by careful measurements of gene expression using microarrays (Gupta, Malley, Oliver, et al., 2006). Analysis of published data from mouse and worm expression arrays reveals a similar balance between X and autosomal genes. Taken together, these results (with  indicate that multiple means have evolved to achieve the same end) emphasize our fundamental ignorance of the underlying transcription-linked process that is being regulated. We note that this paper by Gupta, Malley, Oliver, et al. (J. Biology, Feb. 2006) was accessed more than 8,500 times in the year following its appearance in Feburary 2006, and was the third most accessed paper in this journal over that time period. More recently we have undertaken the study of genome wide associations and how statistical learning machines can be applied to such ultra large data (500K or 1,000K snps), with the aim of locating the most predictive genes or snps among the available features and understanding how linkage disequilibrium compromises or assists these detection methods. n/a",Advanced Methods In Statistical Genetics,7733764,Z01CT000268,"['Accounting', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Drosophila genus', 'Employee Strikes', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Up-Regulation', 'X Chromosome', 'autosome', 'genome wide association study', 'male', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel strategies']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,Z01,2008,280192,0.0037136972669790237
"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Data and pathways will be posted to our Chr21 Gene Function/Pathway database, http://chr21db.cudenver.edu.

"Computational Approaches for RNA StructureFunction Determination ;RNA Secondary Structure Prediction and Analysis       Software:  We continue to improve upon an RNA folding algorithm (MPGAfold)       that uses concepts from genetic algorithms and apply this algorithm to various biological       problems (see below). An optimized version that was adapted to run on LINUX clusters, using       MPI is available upon request. The algorithm is capable of predicting RNA pseudoknots and       exploring folding pathways that contain multiple functional conformations. A Java-based       visualizer for depicting population evolution has also been developed which when coupled with       the MPI version of MPGAfold makes the system more user friendly and portable and allows for a       detailed exploration of the structure population space. STRUCTURELAB, the heterogeneous       bioinformatical RNA analysis workbench, which permits the use of a broad array of approaches       for RNA structure analysis, has been continually enhanced. It has been used for the       visualization of folding pathways in conjunction with the genetic algorithm and with dynamic       programming algorithms (e.g. mFOLD). STRUCTURELAB and other new tools contain several features       which when used together, act as set of data mining methodologies to aid in the discovery of       RNA folding patterns. These systems have been adapted to other environments inside and outside       our laboratory and NIH and are available for download from our newly enhanced Web site.       KNetFold our new algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction has also been enhanced. The       methodology integrates thermodynamic and compensatory base change information using an       innovative machine-learning algorithm (a hierarchical network of k-nearest neighbor       classifiers). KNetFold has been shown to outperform other RNA secondary structure prediction       programs. Another program CorreLogo has also been enhanced. It depicts in a 3-dimensional plot       correlations that exist between base pairs in a secondary structures. These methodologies use       mutual information derived from a sequence alignment. Both KnetFold and CorreLogo can be found       as Web servers on our website. They are also downloadable from our newly configured web site.       We developed a new Web server called RADAR that provides a multitude of functionality for RNA       data analysis. It can align structure-annotated RNA sequences so that both sequence and       structure information are used during the alignment process. This server can perform pairwise       structure alignment, multiple structure alignment, database search and clustering. RADAR       provides two major features. It can perform constrained alignment of RNA secondary structures,       and the prediction of the consensus structure for a set of RNA sequences. In addition, a new       RNA secondary structure Web accessible database, RmotifDB was developed. RmotifDB is also       integrated with a gene ontology database. Algorithms have been developed to determine regions       within genomes that are indicative of non-coding RNAs. Structural characteristics which       distinguish those regions that may occur in intergenic or control regions of RNA are being       determined. These methods have been applied in various biological contexts.       Determination of Biologically Related RNA Secondary Structure Folding       Characteristics:  The above described computational tools have been employed       in studying RNA structural characteristics, folding pathways and functional intermediates of       various RNAs. These are exemplified by the analysis of the folding pathways of the HIV 5' and       3' non-coding regions; the control mechanisms of the hepatitis delta virus, interlukin-2,       rotavirus, dengue fever (and the flaviviruses in general) and the turnip crinkle virus. They       are also providing insight into cancer development that is inducible by the up regulation of       eIF4E or controlled by the presence or absence of PDCD4. Algorithms that were developed for       the determination of non-coding RNAs in genomes are being applied to the intergenic regions of       E. coli, Musashi binding sites and to determine potential structural RNA elements that are       involved in RNA translation initiation. Each of these sites is proving to contain unique       features and characteristics that are inherent to the different biological domains being       examined. Software for RNA 3D Structure Prediction: We       developed a program, RNA2D3D, for interactively exploring RNA 3D conformations at the all atom       level. It works on the premise of generating three-dimensional models of a RNA from a given       RNA secondary structure. The secondary structure may be generated by any one of several       methodologies. The program generates structures very rapidly, allowing the import, for       example, of a secondary structure description of a 1542 base 16S rRNA and generating a rough       3D model in less than a second. As part of the input secondary structure representation, the       specification of pseudoknot interactions is also permitted. RNA2D3D also allows for the       specification of coaxial stacking between stems and compactification, which essentially       extends an A-form helix into loops that can form non-canonical base pairs. This latter feature       is quite helpful because often loops are not found as single strands. General molecular       editing features such as rotating or translating conformational segments are also permitted.       RNA motifs from the Protein Databank (PDB) can also be imported and attached to the modeled       structure. The Tinker molecular dynamics software can be invoked permitting the refinement of       bond angles and distances. Three-Dimensional RNA Structural Modeling and       Analysis:  We have predicted the structure of the wild-type telomerase       pseudoknot and have done molecular dynamics studies on the RNA hairpin and pseudoknot that are       important structural elements in telomerase. These studies show that an unusual sequence of       non-canonical base pairs have dynamic conformational characteristics that induce the formation       of the pseudoknot. These results have significant implications concerning genetic diseases       such as dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia and cancer. New Paradigm for       Translational Enhancement Discovered:  We applied our secondary structure       prediction methodologies, 3-D modeling methodologies, including the molecular modeling       software RNA2D3D, and molecular dynamics to discover a unique motif in the turnip crinkle       virus 3' UTR. It is becoming evident that the 3' UTRs of cellular and viral mRNAs harbor       elements that function in gene expression by enhancing translation using as yet unknown       mechanisms. Some of these cellular mRNAs, including ornithine decarboxylase, encode products       whose overproduction leads to cell proliferation. To determine the function of these elements,       we employed a simple model virus, Turnip crinkle virus (TCV). TCV, like many plant viruses, is       translated in a cap-independent fashion and contains a 3' proximal region that together with       the 5' UTR synergistically enhances translation. We have gained a significant understanding of       the function of this 3' element. We used MPGAfold to identify a series of hairpins and one       pseudoknot that have been confirmed genetically. Using this RNA secondary structural       information in conjunction with RNA2D3D for RNA 3D molecular modeling we predicted that a       series of three hairpins and two pseudoknots structurally resembled a tRNA.

"Applying Bioinformatics to Research in Immune, Muscle, and Bone Diseases The biomining data and discovery section has been actively involved in a variety of NIAMS research project and in particular: A project aimed at distinguish among several auto-inflammatory diseases with various degrees of systemic inflammation, including CAPS (Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes), HIDS (hyper-immunoglobulin D (IgD) syndrome), and TRAPS (Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome), and to identify disease associated genes. This should be achieved by developing a systems biology based approach that identifies transcription factors potentially involved in signal transduction of Pyrin, the key gene that causes Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Furthermore, a possible way to dissect inflammatory and chemotactic pathways in FMF and to identify gene-expression signatures in peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with TRAPS using microarray profiling is investigated. A project aimed at the identification of  signature genes that dictate the fate of adult stem cells to maintain as progenitors used in the therapeutic treatment of diseases and as cell precursors for tissue engineering applications rather than transform to a tumorigenic phenotype;  A project which studis the effect of acetylation of MyoD on temporal patterns of skeletal muscle gene expression, MyoD being a transcription factor involved in a variety of muscle disorders;  A study aimed at performing a genome-wide mapping of histone H3 K4 and K27 trimethylation that will help identity overall patterns of epigenetic modifications involved in lineage fate determination of differentiating CD4+ T cells critical in immune response    As an integral part of a research project, BMDs involvement can be generally described as follows:  	design and implement statistical data analysis strategies 	perform data analysis 	discuss data analysis strategy and analysis results with other project team members 	train researchers such as post-docs for special bioinformatics approaches 	help with interpretation of analysis results obtained by other project team members 	design, develop, and implement special computer programs required by a project 	evaluate and implement special computer software in the public domain as needed by a project 	design and create special figures for research publication  Our IRP made a strategic investmen with the Illuminas NGS (next generation sequencing) Genome Analyzer in October, 2007, which requires dedicated bioinformatics support in analyzing the gigantic amount of data this cutting-edge instrument produces (one experiment run produces about one Terabyte of data and analysis results). As a result, BMD transitioned itself accordingly, focusing now on providing bioinformatics support to Genome Analyzer data based research projects.   During the past year, BMD has provided documented support to 12 research projects from 5 different Laboratories/Branches, developed two major data mining approaches, and designed and implemented 21 computer scripts/programs, as summarized below. 	Gene expression studies of systemic inflammation in patients with Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes 	CD11c+ cells in Pyrin-null mice 	RNA interference of MEFV in THP.1 cells reveals a role for Endogenous pyrin in Toll-like receptor signaling (TLR) that is mediated by the transcription factor IRF2  	Global mapping of histone H3 K4 and K27 trimethylation reveals specificity and plasticity in lineage fate determination of differentiating CD4+ T cells 	Epigenetics of immunoglobulin class recombination and Igh/cMyc chromosomal translocations 	A systems approach using genome-wide microRNA profiling for studying B cell development, activation, and differentiation 	Global mapping of histone H3 K4 and K27 trimethylation of artificial stem cells  	Global gene expression profile of a spontaneously transformed murine mesenchymal stem cell popylation  	Myod acetylation influences temporal patterns of skeletal muscle gene expression 	Genome-wide nucleosome profiles of undifferentiated and mature muscle cells  	Identification and analysis of gene-expression signatures in peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with TRAPS 	Dissecting inflammaroty and chemotactic pathways in FMF  Development of specific data analysis approaches  Creation and application of multiple predictive LDA models using microarray data from patients with inflammatory diseases  Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a statistical and machine learning method used to identify the linear combination of variables that best separates two or more classes, was used to build multiple predictive classifiers. Classifier genes were selected with forward selection, a data-driven model building approach in which orthogonal variables are sequentially added to a model until certain criteria are satisfied. The total number of genes allowed in a classifier was limited to the number of samples in the smallest group to prevent over-fitting. Genes already selected to build a model were removed from the gene pool and the process was repeated to create multiple predictive classifiers of satisfactory quality. Each model is validated with a real leave-one-out cross validation approach, in which a model was completely rebuilt without the removed sample. This whole model building process allowed identification of multiple predictive gene sets. The predictive models are further validated by applying them to an independent data set using a simple voting scheme.  This approach has been successfully applied to several translational research projects involving patients of NOMID (Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease), HIDS (hyper-immunoglobulin D (IgD) syndrome), and TRAPS (Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome). For NOMID project, the specificity and sensitivity of the predictive models are close to 90%.  A systems biology based approach to identify transcription factors potentially involved in specific signal transduction  Genes co-regulated by a transcription factor are expected to carry the corresponding TF binding site in their promoters (shared promoter). This approach starts with a set of user defined genes from microarray or other experiments. Promoter analysis is then performed to identify statistically enriched and commonly shared transcription factor binding sites. Due to the relaxed nature of all TF family binding sites, the existence of a shared TF family binding site, even statistically significant, does not necessarily mean it is functional. It is thus critically important that other lines of evidence be obtained to support and confirm a functional TF binding site. One such piece of evidence, although indirect, may come from the observation that specific TFs corresponding to the shared binding sites are themselves significantly regulated. Results of expression data analysis together with those of promoter analysis thus will point to potential transcription factors that may be involved in regulating the functions of the genes under investigation. This approach has been successfully applied to the project of RNA interference of MEFV in THP.1 cells, where interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) has been identified as a potential mediator of Pyrin.  Research tool development  Illumina only provides a general-purpose pipeline software for image analysis, base calling, and sequence alignment of the data produced by its Genome Analyzer. And there is no commercial software available for analysis beyond sequence because the Genome Analyzer is so new to the market. customized home-made computer programs developed to satisfy very specific research needs.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7445536,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,467804,-0.0071149932302649556
"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"Genetics Pathways of Glioma Invasion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant tumors of glial lineage are therapeutic challenges by virtue of relative inherent resistance to conventional cytolytic therapies and the innate proclivity of these cancer cells to invade into surrounding normal brain. Advances in extending median survival of glioma patients await strategies by which to control invasive tumor. The central hypothesis of this project is that local invasion by malignant glioblastoma cells is driven by specific and unique gene expression changes. Interference with the expression of these genes or interruption of the function of the gene products is likely to specifically target invasive glioblastoma cells, consequently impacting a major cause of tumor progression and recurrence. Success already realized from our use of laser capture microdissection and cDNA microarray analyses has generated candidate genes that have been validated in clinical specimens, and have undergone detailed cell and molecular biology experiments to determine the mechanism(s) by which candidate glioblastoma invasion genes activate the migratory or invasive process. Advances will be garnered through pursuit of 3 aims: The first aim is to sustain the discovery of candidate genes expressed or silenced in highly invasive glioblastoma cells compared to noninvading cells in the same tumor, and to place these candidate gene products into a functional matrix of aberrant signaling outcomes underlying invasion. The second aim is to validate candidate genes discovered in Aim #1 in the context of human glioblastoma invasion. The third aim is to determine the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of action of these genes and their matrix of aberrant signaling to discover points of convergence that serve as targets of vulnerability for therapeutic intervention. The sustained success of this project will assemble an understanding of genes driving the invasive phenotype of glioblastoma cells, discovering and validating crucial biochemical or regulatory linkages with other associated cell behaviors of proliferation and cell survival pathways. These findings will empirically elucidate those points of convergence in the pathways of the invasive phenotype that, when targeted by therapy, will most impact the malignant glial cell.         n/a",Genetics Pathways of Glioma Invasion,7391683,R01NS042262,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Collection', 'Companions', 'Computational Technique', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Sequence', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Harvest', 'Histology', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interruption', 'Invaded', 'Invasive', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Neuroglia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Validation', 'cDNA Arrays', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cryostat', 'gene function', 'laser capture microdissection', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'programs', 'research study', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,TRANSLATIONAL GENOMICS RESEARCH INST,R01,2008,405644,-0.006951786601712395
"A Gene Expression Based Blood Test for Rheumatic Disease Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Clinical dilemma: Recent advances in biologic therapies for rheumatic diseases provide a means for more profound disease management. Proper diagnosis is a necessary aspect of choosing the proper biologic therapy. While disease diagnosis, based on clinical findings and laboratory tests, is effective in a significant number of patients, it can be problematic in patients with early disease, mild symptoms, or unclear presentation, leading to delayed or inappropriate treatment with poor patient outcomes and/or exposures to unnecessary drug toxicities. This problem is due in part to limitations of specificity and sensitivity of current rheumatology diagnostic laboratory tests. Many of these tests are designed to include or rule out one disease, which may be inadequate to obtain a diagnosis if the results are negative. Our preliminary data suggest that a single blood test can be developed which is capable of sensitive and specific disease diagnosis of many common rheumatic diseases using gene expression profiling of peripheral blood. We also have data suggesting that this multi-disease test is effective in patients with early disease prior to full clinical differentiation and may aid in guiding earlier treatment which can dramatically improve outcomes.   Approach: To assess the potential of gene expression-based diagnostic testing, clinical samples were collected from a cohort of patients with definitive forms of inflammatory disease, and broad-based gene expression profiling was performed. Multivariate algorithms identified 38 genes that distinguished controls and the four inflammatory diseases tested with high specificity and sensitivity. We have subsequently collected RNA from a second larger patient cohort with sufficient size to power a study to distinguish among a set of rheumatic diseases that can be difficult to distinguish, namely rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ankylosing spondylitis. Biostatistical analyses of gene expression profiles will allow us to translate these findings into two high throughput clinical tests, the first based on gene expression results and the second based on serum protein biomarkers. Finally, we will assess the prognostic power of gene expression profiling by examining results from patients early in their disease cycle with undifferentiated arthritis to determine who is likely to develop erosive disease and who is likely to go into remission. These findings will allow physicians to use more proactive forms of therapy in early undifferentiated arthritis to delay onset of erosive disease and to use less expensive drugs with fewer side effects for patients that are likely to remit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will identify novel blood markers (biomarkers) for some of the more common forms of rheumatic diseases.  These biomarkers will be used by physicians to accurately diagnose these diseases and to help distinguish patients who are more likely to develop severe forms of disease from those likely to go into remission.  Earlier diagnosis and treatment are linked to better outcome in patients.       n/a",A Gene Expression Based Blood Test for Rheumatic Disease Diagnosis,7394136,R43AR055855,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Ankylosing spondylitis', 'Arthritis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease regression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Serum Proteins', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Undifferentiated', 'base', 'cohort', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prognostic', 'response', 'size', 'tool']",NIAMS,"CRESCENDO BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2008,147000,0.032270965520552454
"The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        This competing renewal application requests five years of support for the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD): The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior. The Surgeon General notes, that 30,000 suicides per year in the United States and ten times that number of suicide attempts, requires a response that involves improving our knowledge regarding the relative importance of multiple predictors of suicide risk. The CCNMD employs a multidisciplinary approach to develop a predictive and explanatory model for suicidal behavior. Project 1: In the brainstem of depressed suicides we have found more serotonin neurons, more TPH, less serotonin transporter expression and 5-HT1A binding, all effects that enhance activity. The brainstem changes may be a response to less serotonin input and lower neurodensity in ventral prefrontal cortex of suicide and that may underlie increased impulsivity and suicide risk. We plan to map the circuitry of suicide by adding studies of anterior cingulate and amygdala, and to study neuron survival in prefrontal cortex. Project 2: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome in the same brain regions as Project 1 will map altered gene expression and be compared to murine models in Projects 6 and 7. Project 3: CCNMD investigators have successfully tested a predictive stress-diathesis model where suicidal ideation is a proximal predictor and lifetime aggressivity/impulsivity is a trait predictor of suicide attempts in major depression. We now propose to evaluate potential causal factors (genes and adverse childhood experiences) and an intermediate biological phenotype, the HPA axis in a prospective study. Project 4: We will use PET to determine whether the postmortem receptor changes differentially associated with major depression and suicide can be distinguished in vivo. Effects of susceptibility gene expression on binding to 5-HTT, 5-HTiA and MAOA will be determined by PET and related to depression and suicidal behavior. Project 5 builds on our familial transmission results. This bottom-up familial transmission study will examine suicidality, aggression/impulsivity, serotonin susceptibility genes, and psychopathology in very high-risk families with depressed adolescent attempter probands. Projects 6 and 7 involve murine models of depression and aggression related to single genes and an inbred strain. Effects of altered gene expression at critical phases and of maternal deprivation on behavior, brain morphology, gene expression profiles, neurogenesis and biochemistry will be evaluated and compared with clinical findings. Project 8 proposed use of statistical model selection for suicide prediction and analysis of large postmortem and in vivo imaging data sets using statistical learning theory that allows the flexible fitting of models with many predictors.       n/a",The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior,7457762,P50MH062185,"['Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'HPSE gene', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strain', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Maternal Deprivation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methaqualone', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Serotonin', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Surgeon', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'brain morphology', 'experience', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurogenesis', 'proband', 'receptor', 'response', 'serotonin transporter', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P50,2008,2105498,0.020368196887176636
"Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Idiosyncratic, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have serious health and economic consequences, yet they are not identified in preclinical testing due to a lack of predictive models. We have developed an animal model that reproduces idiosyncratic liver injury. The model involves treatment of rats with a nontoxic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce mild inflammation followed by treatment with a nontoxic dose of drug. Using this model with two drugs in different pharmacological classes, hepatic gene expression near the onset of injury distinguishes drugs associated with idiosyncratic liver injury in humans from drugs with similar structures that do not have this liability. The long term goal of this research is to evaluate the usefulness of changes in hepatic gene expression in animal models of drug-inflammation interaction as a preclinical predictor of the propensity of drugs to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans. To test the hypothesis that global, hepatic gene expression changes in animal models of inflammation-drug interactions can be used to predict the propensity of drugs to cause human, idiosyncratic liver injury, rats will be cotreated with LPS and one of several drugs (at doses that alone are not hepatotoxic), and microarray analysis of gene expression will be performed on livers. In Specific Aim 1, hepatic gene expression will be analyzed for treatment-related changes. Drugs known to produce idiosyncratic liver injury in people and drugs that are in the same pharmacological classes but are not associated with idiosyncrasy will serve as a ""training set"" in this Aim. In Aim 2, the microarray data will be analyzed for patterns of expression unique to the drug-inflammation interactions that are associated with idiosyncrasy-producing drugs, and the expression data will be probed for specific genes or sets of genes that determine these unique patterns. In Aim 3, additional drugs will be used as a ""validation set"" to evaluate the usefulness of the patterns and genes identified in Aims 1 and 2. The immediate product of these studies will be an animal model of drug-inflammation interaction for which a set of genes has been identified that predicts the propensity for a drug to cause idiosyncratic liver injury in people. If successful, these studies will provide models with which to identify preclinically those drugs that could cause this type of liver damage in people. The relevance of this research to public health lies in the potential to prevent the occurrence of ""unpredictable"", drug-induced liver damage. n/a",Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS,7487344,R21GM075865,"['Address', 'Adverse reactions', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorpromazine', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug toxicity', 'Drug usage', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Famotidine', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Microarray Analysis', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonist', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Ranitidine', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'animal data', 'base', 'data mining', 'drug development', 'drug market', 'health economics', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'post-market', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'segregation', 'trovafloxacin']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,351137,0.015022994161795368
"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that 1 of the most powerful techniques for detemining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are dear. Similarly, genomic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has 2 primary research goals. One (1) is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS) highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for defecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HG'T). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research. ln pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional-annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function. The Investigators propose to attack this problem  by 1). Developing non standard types of clustering methods based on supervised learning algorithms, e.g., Random Forests, 2) Representing the NCS by the parameters of a stochastic model and determining appropriate thresholds for model fitting by using resampling and other Monte Carlo methods. Under the second topic, the investigators propose 2 different approaches for determining whether functionaIly significant FGT has occurred in bacteria. The first approach is to take a known functionally important famlly (NIFgenes) for which HGT is a matter of dispute, and devise quantitative measures which they expect will enable a firm conclusion. They intend to refine similarity measures between genes in different species ,such as BLAST scores, corrected for evolutionary distance. They will compute these measures for pairs of NIF genes in different species, pairs, pairs of genes known to be HGT (antibiotic immunity conferring genes) and genes very unlikely to be HGT (ribosomal proteins). The second approach is to look for anomalously long stretches of 16s RNA conserved within substantial subsets of bacterial species which are otherwise only distantly related.  Mathematical and statistical challenge include: Under approach I, standardizing comparisons of genes with different mutation rates; devising an appropriate classifier for HGT vs. non HGT, and computing appropriate estimates of the probability of classifying a gene as HGT when it isn't and vice versa; Under approach II, extending existing methods for detecting large inclusions by taking into account phylogenetic tree topology and branch lengths.            n/a",Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT,7418308,R01GM075312,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Boxing', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Disputes', 'Distant', 'Drops', 'Exhibits', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nif Genes', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Planning Techniques', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Tetraodontidae', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'statistics', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'willingness']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,162196,0.005594534437293393
"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7473118,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'day', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2008,335920,-0.013055939959410826
"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7387471,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2008,220227,-0.014435849323083115
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7483692,SC1AI080579,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Endopeptidases', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2008,242920,0.011909241121172299
"Statistical Methods for Genomic and Proteomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose developing, evaluating and comparing statistical methods in analyzing and interpreting microarray data, including a heart failure dataset collected in the co-Principal Investigator's lab. Some of the proposed methods will incorporate or be applied to other types of genomic or proteomic data. In Aim A.1, we consider detecting differential gene expression. A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods. We also propose incorporating existing biological data in the statistical methods. In Aim A.2, we study a clustering-based classification (CBC) method for gene function prediction using microarray data. CBC will be compared with other state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests. Other sources of biological data, such as protein-protein interaction data, will be incorporated in the proposed method. In Aim A.3, we consider sample classification and prediction based on gene expression profiles in a general framework called penalized partial least squares (PPLS). PPLS will be compared with other supervised machine learning algorithms. We will extend PPLS to combine microarray data from multiple studies.

"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7322388,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,364130,0.0026307442303180203
"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics,7176152,R01HG003354,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Class', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Today', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'computer program', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'size', 'software development', 'statistics']",NHGRI,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CORPORATION,R01,2007,305165,0.004492445772756707
"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,7259194,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2007,102389,0.02343708642634264
"Microarray and Genome Informatics Developed an application for biological theme extraction of microarray patterns based on ontology related annotation (TEMPORA).  The application takes gene expression patterns that are grouped by a clustering algorithm and tests for the over-representation (the abundance) of Gene Ontology (GO)biological processes for the genes within the clusters.  Then, the application uses latent semantic indexing (a form of natural language processing) to create concepts from the relationship between Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms for diseases and the PubMed documents (scientific articles) that the genes in the GO biological processes of a cluster are published in.  Finally, a similarity matrix is generated from the scientific articles to group the documents by hierarchical clustering.  The scientific articles are labeled by gene IDs, GO biological processes and PubMed IDs so that clusters of documents with associated biological processes can be investigated based on the pattern of the expression from the genes in a given cluster.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Developed an application for generation of phenotypic prototypes (Modk-prototypes).  The application uses k-mode and k-means style clustering of categorical histopathology observations and numeric gene expression and clinical chemistry data respectively to cluster biological samples into groups which share phenotypic responses to stimuli.  The clustering of the samples using Modk-prototypes and all the data together performs better than clustering of the data using any one of the data domains separately or pairwise combinations of the data.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Developed a software for extracting gene expression patterns and identifying co-expressed genes (EPIG).  Through evaluation of the similarity among profiles, the magnitude of variation in gene expression profiles, and profile signal-to-noise ratios, EPIG extracts a set of patterns representing co-expressed genes without a pre-defined seeding of the patterns.  In extracting gene expression patterns, EPIG uses a filtering process where all profiles initially are considered as pattern candidates. Subsequently, EPIG categorizes each gene to the pattern, for which it has the highest similarity with the gene profile.  A gene not assigned to any extracted patterns is considered an orphan if its highest similarity value is lower than a given threshold corresponding to a p-value of 0.0001 to assure the significance of the co-expression.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Developed an application for gene selection and multiclass prediction of biological samples.  The application uses a multiclass kernel for selecting the most informative genes to predict samples with a high degree of accuracy.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Performed scanning of the mouse and human genomes to search for patterns of DNA sequence, motifs and restriction enzyme locations.

The PAGE software clusters profiles of gene expression from multiple biological conditions across dose and time series experiments. Grouping of gene expression patterns is performed in intervals of the measurements using phase-shifts to find clusters of genes which share trends of expression profiles within the dataset. The PAGE method has three phases:  Phase 1: Gene expression pattern matrix transformation into -1,0,1 to indicate the direction of expression change from each biological condition at fixed time and dose points. All biological replicates are averaged if provided.  Phase 2: Generate clusters which have similar patterns of expression of over consecutive conditions  Phase 3: Assign a significance score for each bicluster in all clusters and identify the inhibition patterns of each cluster. n/a",Microarray and Genome Informatics,7594035,Z01ES102345,"['Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'End Point', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grouping', 'Histopathology', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Location', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noise', 'Ontology', 'Orphan', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Processed Genes', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Variant', 'base', 'concept', 'indexing', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'restriction enzyme', 'tool', 'trend']",NIEHS,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES,Z01,2007,1347190,0.032520060721955076
"Computer Analysis of Nucleic Acid Structure <b>RNA Secondary Structure Prediction and Analysis Software:</b> We continue to improve upon an RNA folding algorithm (MPGAfold) that uses concepts from genetic algorithms and apply this algorithm to various biological problems (see below). An optimized version that was adapted to run on LINUX clusters, using MPI is available upon request. The algorithm is capable of predicting RNA pseudoknots and exploring folding pathways that contain multiple functional conformations. A Java-based visualizer for depicting population evolution has also been developed which when coupled with the MPI version of MPGAfold makes the system more user friendly and portable and allows for a detailed exploration of the structure population space. Several groups are now employing the use of these algorithms. STRUCTURELAB, the heterogeneous bioinformatical RNA analysis workbench, which permits the use of a broad array of approaches for RNA structure analysis, has been continually enhanced. It has been used for the visualization of folding pathways in conjunction with the genetic algorithm (see above). STRUCTURELAB and other new tools contain several features which when used together, act as set of data mining methodologies to aid in the discovery of RNA folding patterns. These systems have been adapted to other environments inside and outside our laboratory and NIH and are available for download from our newly enhanced Web site. Many groups from around the world have downloaded this software. KNetFold our new algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction has also been enhanced. The methodology integrates thermodynamic and compensatory base change information using an innovative machine-learning algorithm (a hierarchical network of k-nearest neighbor classifiers). KnetFold has been shown to outperform other RNA secondary structure prediction programs. Another program CorreLogo has also been enhanced. It depicts in a 3-dimensional plot correlations that exist between base pairs in a secondary structures. These methodologies use mutual information derived from a sequence alignment. Both KnetFold and CorreLogo can be found as Web servers on our website. They are also downloadable from our newly configured web site. Many groups have downloaded these software packages. We have also developed a suite of programs to investigate the sequence and structural characteristics that are inherent in the control of translation initiation of mRNAs. We developed a new Web server called RADAR that provides a multitude of functionality for RNA data analysis. It can align structure-annotated RNA sequences so that both sequence and structure information are used during the alignment process. This server can perform pairwise structure alignment, multiple structure alignment, database search and clustering. RADAR provides two major features. It can perform constrained alignment of RNA secondary structures, and the prediction of the consensus structure for a set of RNA sequences. In addition, a new RNA secondary structure Web accessible database, RmotifDB was developed. RmotifDB is also integrated with a gene ontology database. Algorithms have been developed to determine regions within genomes that are indicative of non-coding RNAs. Structural characteristics which distinguish those regions that may occur in intergenic or control regions of RNA are being determined. These methods have been applied in various biological contexts (see below). <b>Determination of Biologically Related RNA Secondary Structure Folding Characteristics:</b> The above described computational tools have been employed in studying RNA structural characteristics, folding pathways and functional intermediates of various RNAs. These are exemplified by the analysis of the folding pathways of the HIV 5' and 3' non-coding regions; the control mechanisms of the hepatitis delta virus, interlukin-2, rotavirus, dengue fever (and the flaviviruses in general) and the turnip crinkle virus. They are also providing insight into cancer development that is inducible by the up regulation of eIF4E or controlled by the presence or absence of PDCD4. Algorithms that were developed for the determination of non-coding RNAs in genomes are being applied to the intergenic regions of E. coli, Musashi binding sites and to determine potential structural RNA elements that are involved in RNA translation initiation. Each of these sites is proving to contain unique features and characteristics that are inherent to the different biological domains being examined. <b>Three-Dimensional RNA Structural Modeling and Analysis:</b> In order to understand RNA structures, nanostructures, folding pathways and the structural effects of RNA-Protein interactions at the atomic level, structural elements of RNA molecules are being studied using molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations. Studies include RNA tetraloops, bulge loops, kissing loops, n-way junctions and motifs that are of specific importance to the function of molecules that are involved in disease processes. These studies have lead to the understanding of subtle atomic level interactions for RNA molecular function and RNA nanodesign. We have, for example, predicted the structure of the wild-type telomerase pseudoknot and have done molecular dynamics studies on the RNA hairpin and pseudoknot that are important structural elements in telomerase. These studies show that an unusual sequence of non-canonical base pairs have dynamic conformational characteristics that induce the formation of the pseudoknot. These results have significant implications concerning genetic diseases such as dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia and cancer. We have also applied our secondary structure prediction methodologies, 3-D modeling methodologies, including the molecular modeling software RNA2D3D developed with our group, and molecular dynamics to discover a unique motif in the turnip crinkle virus 3 UTR. This structural motif has experimentally been shown to bind ribosomes and to act as a translational enhancer. Thus we have discovered a new paradigm for translational enhancement. We have also applied a somewhat different technique to generate feasible transition pathways between two different 3D conformations of RNA molecules. This utilizes a methodology known as elastic network interpolation (ENI). 3D folding pathways can be generated with good accuracy and much more quickly than with conventional molecular dynamics methods. Research is ongoing to develop a methodology which combines computational modeling with experimental structure determination to elucidate the structure of various RNAs. <b>RNA Nanobiology:</b> We have filed a patent and have a publication related to a novel design for a hexagonal RNA nano-ring and a self-assembling nanotube which is currently undergoing experimental testing. In addition, we developed a web accessible RNA motif database, RNAjunction, consisting of RNA n-way junctions and kissing loops. This database is being used for the construction of RNA tectoshapes. The RNAJunction database contains structure and sequence information for RNA structural elements such as helical junctions, internal loops, bulges and loop-loop interactions. Our database provides a user-friendly way of searching for significant RNA structural motifs. This database is useful for analyzing RNA structures as well as for designing novel RNA structures on a nanoscale. The construction of the RNA structures is being greatly enhanced by the use of our newly developed software NanoTiler. NanoTiler is a comprehensive system that significantly enhances the design of RNA based nanoparticles by allowing for automatic and human interaction in the development, placement and determination of RNA building blocks.

"The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        This competing renewal application requests five years of support for the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD): The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior. The Surgeon General notes, that 30,000 suicides per year in the United States and ten times that number of suicide attempts, requires a response that involves improving our knowledge regarding the relative importance of multiple predictors of suicide risk. The CCNMD employs a multidisciplinary approach to develop a predictive and explanatory model for suicidal behavior. Project 1: In the brainstem of depressed suicides we have found more serotonin neurons, more TPH, less serotonin transporter expression and 5-HT1A binding, all effects that enhance activity. The brainstem changes may be a response to less serotonin input and lower neurodensity in ventral prefrontal cortex of suicide and that may underlie increased impulsivity and suicide risk. We plan to map the circuitry of suicide by adding studies of anterior cingulate and amygdala, and to study neuron survival in prefrontal cortex. Project 2: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome in the same brain regions as Project 1 will map altered gene expression and be compared to murine models in Projects 6 and 7. Project 3: CCNMD investigators have successfully tested a predictive stress-diathesis model where suicidal ideation is a proximal predictor and lifetime aggressivity/impulsivity is a trait predictor of suicide attempts in major depression. We now propose to evaluate potential causal factors (genes and adverse childhood experiences) and an intermediate biological phenotype, the HPA axis in a prospective study. Project 4: We will use PET to determine whether the postmortem receptor changes differentially associated with major depression and suicide can be distinguished in vivo. Effects of susceptibility gene expression on binding to 5-HTT, 5-HTiA and MAOA will be determined by PET and related to depression and suicidal behavior. Project 5 builds on our familial transmission results. This bottom-up familial transmission study will examine suicidality, aggression/impulsivity, serotonin susceptibility genes, and psychopathology in very high-risk families with depressed adolescent attempter probands. Projects 6 and 7 involve murine models of depression and aggression related to single genes and an inbred strain. Effects of altered gene expression at critical phases and of maternal deprivation on behavior, brain morphology, gene expression profiles, neurogenesis and biochemistry will be evaluated and compared with clinical findings. Project 8 proposed use of statistical model selection for suicide prediction and analysis of large postmortem and in vivo imaging data sets using statistical learning theory that allows the flexible fitting of models with many predictors.       n/a",The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior,7249470,P50MH062185,"['Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'HPSE gene', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strain', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Maternal Deprivation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methaqualone', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Serotonin', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Surgeon', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'brain morphology', 'experience', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurogenesis', 'proband', 'receptor', 'response', 'serotonin transporter', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P50,2007,2152844,0.020368196887176636
"Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Idiosyncratic, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have serious health and economic consequences, yet they are not identified in preclinical testing due to a lack of predictive models. We have developed an animal model that reproduces idiosyncratic liver injury. The model involves treatment of rats with a nontoxic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce mild inflammation followed by treatment with a nontoxic dose of drug. Using this model with two drugs in different pharmacological classes, hepatic gene expression near the onset of injury distinguishes drugs associated with idiosyncratic liver injury in humans from drugs with similar structures that do not have this liability. The long term goal of this research is to evaluate the usefulness of changes in hepatic gene expression in animal models of drug-inflammation interaction as a preclinical predictor of the propensity of drugs to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans. To test the hypothesis that global, hepatic gene expression changes in animal models of inflammation-drug interactions can be used to predict the propensity of drugs to cause human, idiosyncratic liver injury, rats will be cotreated with LPS and one of several drugs (at doses that alone are not hepatotoxic), and microarray analysis of gene expression will be performed on livers. In Specific Aim 1, hepatic gene expression will be analyzed for treatment-related changes. Drugs known to produce idiosyncratic liver injury in people and drugs that are in the same pharmacological classes but are not associated with idiosyncrasy will serve as a ""training set"" in this Aim. In Aim 2, the microarray data will be analyzed for patterns of expression unique to the drug-inflammation interactions that are associated with idiosyncrasy-producing drugs, and the expression data will be probed for specific genes or sets of genes that determine these unique patterns. In Aim 3, additional drugs will be used as a ""validation set"" to evaluate the usefulness of the patterns and genes identified in Aims 1 and 2. The immediate product of these studies will be an animal model of drug-inflammation interaction for which a set of genes has been identified that predicts the propensity for a drug to cause idiosyncratic liver injury in people. If successful, these studies will provide models with which to identify preclinically those drugs that could cause this type of liver damage in people. The relevance of this research to public health lies in the potential to prevent the occurrence of ""unpredictable"", drug-induced liver damage. n/a",Gene Expression in Drug-inflammation Models as Predictive of Idiosyncratic ADRS,7263212,R21GM075865,"['Address', 'Adverse reactions', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorpromazine', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug toxicity', 'Drug usage', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Famotidine', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Microarray Analysis', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonist', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Ranitidine', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'animal data', 'base', 'data mining', 'drug development', 'drug market', 'health economics', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'post-market', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'segregation', 'trovafloxacin']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,357938,0.015022994161795368
"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that 1 of the most powerful techniques for detemining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are dear. Similarly, genomic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has 2 primary research goals. One (1) is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS) highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for defecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HG'T). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research. ln pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional-annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function. The Investigators propose to attack this problem  by 1). Developing non standard types of clustering methods based on supervised learning algorithms, e.g., Random Forests, 2) Representing the NCS by the parameters of a stochastic model and determining appropriate thresholds for model fitting by using resampling and other Monte Carlo methods. Under the second topic, the investigators propose 2 different approaches for determining whether functionaIly significant FGT has occurred in bacteria. The first approach is to take a known functionally important famlly (NIFgenes) for which HGT is a matter of dispute, and devise quantitative measures which they expect will enable a firm conclusion. They intend to refine similarity measures between genes in different species ,such as BLAST scores, corrected for evolutionary distance. They will compute these measures for pairs of NIF genes in different species, pairs, pairs of genes known to be HGT (antibiotic immunity conferring genes) and genes very unlikely to be HGT (ribosomal proteins). The second approach is to look for anomalously long stretches of 16s RNA conserved within substantial subsets of bacterial species which are otherwise only distantly related.  Mathematical and statistical challenge include: Under approach I, standardizing comparisons of genes with different mutation rates; devising an appropriate classifier for HGT vs. non HGT, and computing appropriate estimates of the probability of classifying a gene as HGT when it isn't and vice versa; Under approach II, extending existing methods for detecting large inclusions by taking into account phylogenetic tree topology and branch lengths.            n/a",Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT,7240439,R01GM075312,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Boxing', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Disputes', 'Distant', 'Drops', 'Exhibits', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nif Genes', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Planning Techniques', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Tetraodontidae', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'statistics', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'willingness']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,163829,0.005594534437293393

"Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A comprehensive model of a complete biological system will enable prediction of phenotypic outcomes in face of novel genetic and environmental perturbations. Such predictive power for cellular systems, such as DMA repair, will have tremendous impacts on early detection and diagnosis of genetic disorders and, ultimately in designing preventive and/or curative treatments. However, the full understanding of eukaryotic DMA repair systems presents a daunting challenge due to their enormous complexity, especially given that systems approaches are not yet sufficiently mature to mathematically model such complex processes. At a molecular level, eukaryotic genetic information processing is mirrored in a simplified manner by their evolutionary ancestors, the archaea. In Halobacterium NRC-1 we have a simple yet powerful model system of -2400 genes in which the underlying generalized principles of a systems approach can be delineated. This halophilic archaeon routinely mitigates damage from high salinity, UV radiation and desiccation-rehydration cycles. We will use this model system to address the hypothesis that the decision making process governing cell fate after exposure to DMA damaging events such as UV irradiation is mediated by robust gene regulatory networks that simultaneously process information on spectral characteristics of the impinging radiation, the nature and extent of DMA damage and the potential preparative role of cellular entrainment to diurnal cycles. This hypothesis is motivated by two main observations: a. in systems analysis of UV response, although extraordinarily resistant, not all expected repair genes in this microbe responded to irradiation or damage; b. many of these damage-unresponsive repair genes did, however, respond to day-night entrainment. At a fundamental level this suggested that the resident state of the cell at time of irradiation may influence the type of response elicited. A systems approach is ideally suited to delinate the networks underlying this decision making process. Specifically, we will measure dynamic global changes (degree of damage, mRNA /protein levels, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions) in wild type and mutant strains (defective in sensors, signal transducers, regulators and repair proteins) subjected to combinatorial changes in incident radiation, type of damage inflicted and resident state of the cell at the time of radiation. Through an integrated analysis of these diverse systems level data we will statistically learn perturbation-induced rewiring of a gene regulatory network that processes environmental perturbations (input) into phenotype (output), i.e. a predictive model for regulatory mechanisms for repair. This basic model will serve as a template for designing systems approaches to model higher complexities of eukaryotic repair processes.           n/a",Interrogation of systems level mechanisms controlling DNA repair processes,7317856,R01GM077398,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archaea', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA lesion', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desiccation', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Information Processing Pathway', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Global Change', 'Halobacterium', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Rehydrations', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transducers', 'Translations', 'UV response', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'biological research', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'coping', 'cryptochrome', 'day', 'design', 'gene repair', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'halobacteria', 'interest', 'irradiation', 'knockout gene', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'repaired', 'response', 'segregation', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'trait', 'ultraviolet damage', 'ultraviolet irradiation']",NIGMS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2007,335920,-0.013055939959410826
"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7234993,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2007,257655,-0.014435849323083115
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7287978,SC1GM081068,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Endopeptidases', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2007,247625,0.011909241121172299
"Support Vector Machine modeling software for improving RNAi efficacy prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference: Project Summary/Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a group of algorithms in supervised machine learning that are able to build classification or regression models on training data such that these models can be used to predict information not seen during model construction. RNA interference (RNAi) is the property of small (20 to 23 bases) RNA sequences that with the help of the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) enable the catalytic cleavage of target RNA sequences and the knockdown of the expression level of the target gene. The steps involved in loading and associating an RNAi sequences into an active RISC are several in addition to the multi-factorial variation in biochemical activities of RNAi sequences once in an active RISC. Finding the relevant biochemical features that associate with these quantifiable measures of RNAi can allow i) better predictive models of RNAi and RNAi-like (e.g. microRNAs) activities and ii) a better understanding of the relevant biochemical properties since presumably less relevant properties should not increase the predictive abilities of models containing those properties. We have developed a novel feature mapping method, referred to as Binary Base mapping, that improves the ability of a SVM to predict RNAi activities when compared to 2 previous methods, refered to as Unit Vector and N-gram mapping. Alone, the Binary Base SVM method has greater predictive accuracy than a recently published neural network machine learning method, on the same training and testing data. Several additional mapping methods can be envisioned, including methods that incorporate RNAi thermodynamics, secondary structure or measures of entropy, and whether alone or in combination these mappings of sequence to vector space for SVM model construction lead to better predictive models or understanding of RNAi biochemistry is unknown. We are requesting funding for the specific aims of: i) testing whether the Binary Base method can be used to further dissect and identify relevant biochemical feature associated with RNAi activity, ii) analyzing what additional vector mapping methods lead to predictive models with increased accuracy or greater understanding of relevant biochemical properties, and iii) investigating the distribution of sites within and among target mRNA genes where predictive SVM models identify high versus low activity. Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference: Project Narrative: Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have regulatory influence in human development and disease and better understanding how these molecules function involves the development of predictive models. Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are 1 way to develop predictive models for these small RNA sequences and the incorporation of novel mapping methods in SVMs leads to model improvement. Finding and combining additional sequence mapping methods can lead to better predictive models for RNA interference activity as well as related processes such as microRNA activity, chemical modification of RNAi and RNAi stability or RNAi toxicity; further improving the understanding of how scnRNAs function and how they might be regulated.          n/a",Support Vector Machine modeling software for improving RNAi efficacy prediction,7157547,R43GM079132,"['RNA interference', 'biotechnology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gene targeting', 'genetic mapping', 'mathematical model', 'messenger RNA', 'method development', 'molecular genetics', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'thermodynamics']",NIGMS,"INTEGRATED DNA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2006,97773,0.012984408203067637

"Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reverse engineering of cellular genetic circuits from gene expression data is an important and scientifically challenging problem. When applied to system more complex than a yeast cell, however, most of the approaches for reverse engineering are limited by their reliance on a significant number of ad-hoc perturbation, such as gene knockout.  We propose to address these issues and to attempt to reconstruct the genetic circuitry of human B-cells by coupling three distinct components: 1) an information theoretic method for the inference of cellular networks from microarray profile data for a large number of distinct cellular and molecular phenotypes 2) A synthetic network simulation framework for the assessment of the performance of the reverse engineering under a variety of constraints and conditions, such as noise and network complexity. 3) An adaptive learning method that will iteratively apply optimal perturbations to the biological system, which will allow refining the cellular network model over time.  Furthermore, we propose to biologically validate this approach by elucidating the cellular networks of human B lymphocytes, from a variety of normal, tumor-derived, and experimentally manipulated B cell phenotypes, which are significant both from an oncological and immunological perspective. This will be accomplished by analyzing an existing set of over 340 high-quality microarray expression profiles.  Finally, we will create a software platform to reverse engineer any biological system for which adequate microarray data is available. The platform will also allow to design and perform virtual, in-silico gene perturbation experiments. n/a",Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes,7082976,R01CA109755,"['B lymphocyte', 'artificial intelligence', 'cellular oncology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'cytogenetics', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression profiling', 'genetic models', 'human data', 'lymphoma', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular genetics', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,373483,0.0174291020981014
"Statistical Methods for Genomic and Proteomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose developing, evaluating and comparing statistical methods in analyzing and interpreting microarray data, including a heart failure dataset collected in the co-Principal Investigator's lab. Some of the proposed methods will incorporate or be applied to other types of genomic or proteomic data. In Aim A.1, we consider detecting differential gene expression. A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods. We also propose incorporating existing biological data in the statistical methods. In Aim A.2, we study a clustering-based classification (CBC) method for gene function prediction using microarray data. CBC will be compared with other state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests. Other sources of biological data, such as protein-protein interaction data, will be incorporated in the proposed method. In Aim A.3, we consider sample classification and prediction based on gene expression profiles in a general framework called penalized partial least squares (PPLS).

"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dyanamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dyanamics,7033620,R01HG003354,"['behavior', 'computer program /software', 'experimental designs', 'gene expression', 'genes', 'genome', 'mathematical model', 'model']",NHGRI,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOSTON,R01,2006,325000,0.0046914076890864345
"In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in computation and high-throughput methods of biomedical data collection have created tremendous opportunities to advance our understanding of visual physiology. We will test the hypothesis that genes and their protein products expressed in ocular tissues can be analyzed in silico using statistical and machine learning techniques and create knowledge regarding ocular gene regulation, structure and function. In particular, these studies will produce testable predictions that may be validated by bench experiments.

"Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   To date, post-genomic analysis has focused on identification and annotation of protein-coding genes and their products. In comparison, the identification of DNA sequences encoding functional RNA has been largely neglected. Functional RNAs can encode trans-acting molecules that interact with other RNAs or proteins, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, RNaseP RNA, small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs; they can also function in cis as untranslated regions that regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that there may be hundreds of unknown functional RNAs in prokaryotes and thousands in eukaryotes.      The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a computational approach to the identification of novel RNA genes and functional RNA elements in complete DNA genomes. Machine learning techniques will be used to recognize hallmarks of functional RNA coding sequences by comparison with sequences that do not encode RNAs. Several types of signals are useful in discriminating functional RNA including: 1) differences in global sequence composition, 2) calculated RNA secondary structure features, i.e. free energy of folding and 3) specific sequence elements common to RNA structure. These and other parameters can be rapidly tried and tested using machine learning methods. This method will be optimized for individual genomes with respect to input databases, parameterization and machine learning method and architecture. Results will be evaluated computationally by cross-validation testing, comparative genomics, and calculated secondary structure and free energy of folding. Experimental studies of RNA expression and function will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators.      Preliminary studies have demonstrated the power of this approach to predict novel functional RNAs in E. coli, other bacteria and archaea as supported by computational cross-validation and experimental confirmation. We will test and apply this approach to discover new functional RNAs in eukaryotic genomes including S. cervisiae, C. elegans, and humans. RNA prediction for these larger and more complex genomes will require the optimization of computational parameters, as well as the development of appropriate input datasets and training algorithms.      The prediction of novel functional RNAs in the human genome presents an opportunity to understand new regulatory and developmental processes. Known RNAs implicated in human disease, such as telomerase RNA (cancer, aging), XIST RNA (X-chromosome inactivation) and BIC (a proto-oncogene) underscore the importance of developing a method to identify the full complement of human RNA genes.         n/a",Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences,6891680,R01HG002665,"['Archaea', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Escherichia coli', 'RNA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'animal genetic material tag', 'artificial intelligence', 'biotechnology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'eukaryote', 'functional /structural genomics', 'genetic library', 'genetic mapping', 'human genetic material tag', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid quantitation /detection', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'prokaryote', 'technology /technique development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2005,377162,0.024464093270553097
"Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma, the second most common cancer in the world, and of its precancerous precursor lesions has become much better elucidated in recent years, but much remains to be discovered. For example, tumor suppressor gene mutation, DNA hypermethylation, microsatellite instability (MSI), and altered gene expression have been shown to occur frequently during the origin and progression of this cancer. However, a greater understanding of these mechanisms and their timing in gastric carcinogenesis could lead to the ultimate development of early detection and staging biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this deadly disease. Therefore, in order to deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gastric carcinogenesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare and contrast the global gene expression patterns of various subtypes and premalignant stages of gastric cancer, using cDNA microarrays and bioinformatics algorithms. 1a) cDNA microarrays will be produced and hybridized to amplified RNA from various histologic subtypes and premalignant stage precursor lesions of gastric cancer. 1b) The bioinformatics programs Cluster/Treeview, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) will be used to derive global gene expression patterns for each subtype of gastric cancer or precursor lesion. During this process, we will also identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed among the various subgroups. 2) To perform a limited methylotyping assay to ascertain epigenetic signatures of different types of gastric cancer and premalignant lesions, focusing on known as well as novel CpG islands in the promoter or upstream regions of genes. 2a) Known methylation targets will be analyzed, including E-cadherin (CDH 1), p 16, p 15, p 14-ARF, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), human mutL homolog 1 (hMLH1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), RASSFIA, deleted in colon carcinoma (DCC), and 14-3-3-sigma. 2b) Novel methylation target searches will be performed using CpG island microarrays, with alternative backup approaches to include methylation-sensitive genomic DNA digestion followed by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), as well as single-gene MSP. 3) To correlate the results of, aims (1) and (2) with each other as well as with other clinical and biologic parameters of these gastric lesions. n/a",Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer,6949187,R21CA098450,"['CpG islands', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinoma', 'gene expression', 'human subject', 'methylation', 'microarray technology', 'molecular oncology', 'molecular pathology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid hybridization', 'patient oriented research', 'stomach neoplasms']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2005,148500,-0.04627406034813484

Although the strategies for gene discovery have become very powerful in recent years, there remains a major obstacle to the discovery of genes that underlie common, late-onset diseases like AMD.

"Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reverse engineering of cellular genetic circuits from gene expression data is an important and scientifically challenging problem. When applied to system more complex than a yeast cell, however, most of the approaches for reverse engineering are limited by their reliance on a significant number of ad-hoc perturbation, such as gene knockout.  We propose to address these issues and to attempt to reconstruct the genetic circuitry of human B-cells by coupling three distinct components: 1) an information theoretic method for the inference of cellular networks from microarray profile data for a large number of distinct cellular and molecular phenotypes 2) A synthetic network simulation framework for the assessment of the performance of the reverse engineering under a variety of constraints and conditions, such as noise and network complexity. 3) An adaptive learning method that will iteratively apply optimal perturbations to the biological system, which will allow refining the cellular network model over time.  Furthermore, we propose to biologically validate this approach by elucidating the cellular networks of human B lymphocytes, from a variety of normal, tumor-derived, and experimentally manipulated B cell phenotypes, which are significant both from an oncological and immunological perspective. This will be accomplished by analyzing an existing set of over 340 high-quality microarray expression profiles.  Finally, we will create a software platform to reverse engineer any biological system for which adequate microarray data is available. The platform will also allow to design and perform virtual, in-silico gene perturbation experiments. n/a",Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes,6925178,R01CA109755,"['B lymphocyte', 'artificial intelligence', 'cellular oncology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'cytogenetics', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression profiling', 'genetic models', 'human data', 'lymphoma', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular genetics', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,387233,0.0174291020981014

Some of the proposed methods will incorporate or be applied to other types of genomic or proteomic data. In Aim A.1, we consider detecting differential gene expression. A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods. We also propose incorporating existing biological data in the statistical methods. In Aim A.2, we study a clustering-based classification (CBC) method for gene function prediction using microarray data. CBC will be compared with other state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests. Other sources of biological data, such as protein-protein interaction data, will be incorporated in the proposed method. In Aim A.3, we consider sample classification and prediction based on gene expression profiles in a general framework called penalized partial least squares (PPLS).

"The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of preterm labor have been well documented, but the relative impact of genetic predisposition, as compared to environmental and behavioral factors is not known. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that differential gene expression contributes to disparity in infection-associated preterm labor. A second objective is the creation of two large and novel resources for studying preterm labor: (1) a database of candidate critical genes, and, (2) a human gene expression tissue bank. We suggest that elucidating the pathophysiology of preterm labor requires the power to perform analyses of the fetomaternal interactions required for parturition on a genomic scale. For practical and ethical reasons, a primary study of this type in humans would be severely limited. Therefore, in the first phase of this project, we will use a validated, tightly controlled murine model of infection-induced preterm labor to generate a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression over time in multiple tissues. Preterm pregnant mice will be randomized to treatment groups modeling one of clinical conditions: A. infection with labor; B. infection without labor; C. labor without infection; and D. no infection/no labor. RNA will then be collected from myometrium, ovaries, decidua, placentas and fetal membranes from each of the groups in a time series, and the relative expression of thousands of genes will be analyzed in these samples using DNA microarrays. A similarity metric and a clustering algorithm will be used to categorize individual genes by temporal expression patterns. A novel subtractive strategy will allow us to differentiate transcripts active specifically in infection-induced from those important for infection or labor alone. Inferences will be drawn regarding the involvement of genes not physic represented in the micro arrays by mapping into known functional pathways. The final result of this analysis will be a ""short list"" of candidate genes with potentially critical roles in infection-induced labor. In the second phase of the project, we analyze human tissues (myometrium, placenta, chorion, amnion, decidua, amniocytes and blood) collected from approximately 1360 patients presenting in term and preterm labor in a cross-sectional case-control study matching for race. Expression analysis in these tissues will be targeted to the human homologues of the enriched list of candidate critical genes identified in the mouse. Differential gene expression in pre term labor with or without infection and premature rupture membranes, as well as among different racial groups, will be characterized. A computational tool known as a support vector machine will be used to generate a rank order list predictive of preterm delivery, taking into account historical, clinical and laboratory variables. This tool will identify the subset(s) of genes most likely to form the genetic basis of preterm labor, and may provide a diagnostic molecular profiling instrument for predicting preterm delivery. The large databases generated in this study will be valuable to any researcher interested in parturition and will be made accessible on the Internet. n/a",The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf*,6929305,R01HD041689,"['DNA', 'Escherichia coli', 'RNA', 'bacteria infection mechanism', 'decidua', 'disease /disorder model', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'embryo /fetus membrane', 'epidemiology', 'female', 'gene expression', 'genetic susceptibility', 'human tissue', 'induced labor', 'infection', 'laboratory mouse', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'myometrium', 'ovary', 'pathologic process', 'placenta', 'premature labor', 'racial /ethnic difference', 'tissue /cell culture']",NICHD,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2005,300000,0.04540115049424493
"In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in computation and high-throughput methods of biomedical data collection have created tremendous opportunities to advance our understanding of visual physiology. We will test the hypothesis that genes and their protein products expressed in ocular tissues can be analyzed in silico using statistical and machine learning techniques and create knowledge regarding ocular gene regulation, structure and function. In particular, these studies will produce testable predictions that may be validated by bench experiments. A primary goal will be to characterize the regulatory elements that govern gene expression in ocular cells. In addition, these tools will be used to characterize ocular protein structure, particularly structure/function relationships and to make predictions about secondary and tertiary structure. Finally, in silico methods will be used to analyze the gene/protein networks that carry out cellular functions such as metabolism, signal transduction and regulation of gone expression. The following specific questions will be addressed in this research:      1) Can computational and statistical methods be used to identify DNA sequences that regulate   ocular gene expression? Can these sequences be used to identify new, uncharacterized   genes in the human genome?      2) Can these methods be used to predict protein structural features in both health and disease   states?      3) Can gene/protein functional networks be elucidated in silico by the use of advanced   analytical and modeling techniques?      This proposal describes a four year training program that aims to develop the independent research abilities of the PI, and to prepare for a career as an individual investigator in computational biology and translational medicine.         n/a",In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins,6919176,K08EY014665,"['DNA binding protein', 'biological signal transduction', 'computational biology', 'eye', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression', 'genetic library', 'genetic regulation', 'genetic regulatory element', 'glycoproteins', 'mathematical model', 'metabolism', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein structure function', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'silicon compounds', 'statistics /biometry', 'trabecular meshwork', 'vision']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K08,2005,176458,-0.00889363855775937
"Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   To date, post-genomic analysis has focused on identification and annotation of protein-coding genes and their products. In comparison, the identification of DNA sequences encoding functional RNA has been largely neglected. Functional RNAs can encode trans-acting molecules that interact with other RNAs or proteins, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, RNaseP RNA, small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs; they can also function in cis as untranslated regions that regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that there may be hundreds of unknown functional RNAs in prokaryotes and thousands in eukaryotes.      The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a computational approach to the identification of novel RNA genes and functional RNA elements in complete DNA genomes. Machine learning techniques will be used to recognize hallmarks of functional RNA coding sequences by comparison with sequences that do not encode RNAs. Several types of signals are useful in discriminating functional RNA including: 1) differences in global sequence composition, 2) calculated RNA secondary structure features, i.e. free energy of folding and 3) specific sequence elements common to RNA structure. These and other parameters can be rapidly tried and tested using machine learning methods. This method will be optimized for individual genomes with respect to input databases, parameterization and machine learning method and architecture. Results will be evaluated computationally by cross-validation testing, comparative genomics, and calculated secondary structure and free energy of folding. Experimental studies of RNA expression and function will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators.      Preliminary studies have demonstrated the power of this approach to predict novel functional RNAs in E. coli, other bacteria and archaea as supported by computational cross-validation and experimental confirmation. We will test and apply this approach to discover new functional RNAs in eukaryotic genomes including S. cervisiae, C. elegans, and humans. RNA prediction for these larger and more complex genomes will require the optimization of computational parameters, as well as the development of appropriate input datasets and training algorithms.      The prediction of novel functional RNAs in the human genome presents an opportunity to understand new regulatory and developmental processes. Known RNAs implicated in human disease, such as telomerase RNA (cancer, aging), XIST RNA (X-chromosome inactivation) and BIC (a proto-oncogene) underscore the importance of developing a method to identify the full complement of human RNA genes.         n/a",Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences,6751643,R01HG002665,"['Archaea', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Escherichia coli', 'RNA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'animal genetic material tag', 'artificial intelligence', 'biotechnology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'eukaryote', 'functional /structural genomics', 'genetic library', 'genetic mapping', 'human genetic material tag', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid quantitation /detection', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'prokaryote', 'technology /technique development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2004,377162,0.024464093270553097

"Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma, the second most common cancer in the world, and of its precancerous precursor lesions has become much better elucidated in recent years, but much remains to be discovered. For example, tumor suppressor gene mutation, DNA hypermethylation, microsatellite instability (MSI), and altered gene expression have been shown to occur frequently during the origin and progression of this cancer. However, a greater understanding of these mechanisms and their timing in gastric carcinogenesis could lead to the ultimate development of early detection and staging biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this deadly disease. Therefore, in order to deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gastric carcinogenesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare and contrast the global gene expression patterns of various subtypes and premalignant stages of gastric cancer, using cDNA microarrays and bioinformatics algorithms. 1a) cDNA microarrays will be produced and hybridized to amplified RNA from various histologic subtypes and premalignant stage precursor lesions of gastric cancer. 1b) The bioinformatics programs Cluster/Treeview, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) will be used to derive global gene expression patterns for each subtype of gastric cancer or precursor lesion. During this process, we will also identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed among the various subgroups. 2) To perform a limited methylotyping assay to ascertain epigenetic signatures of different types of gastric cancer and premalignant lesions, focusing on known as well as novel CpG islands in the promoter or upstream regions of genes. 2a) Known methylation targets will be analyzed, including E-cadherin (CDH 1), p 16, p 15, p 14-ARF, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), human mutL homolog 1 (hMLH1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), RASSFIA, deleted in colon carcinoma (DCC), and 14-3-3-sigma. 2b) Novel methylation target searches will be performed using CpG island microarrays, with alternative backup approaches to include methylation-sensitive genomic DNA digestion followed by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), as well as single-gene MSP. 3) To correlate the results of, aims (1) and (2) with each other as well as with other clinical and biologic parameters of these gastric lesions. n/a",Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer,6770192,R21CA098450,"['CpG islands', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinoma', 'gene expression', 'human subject', 'methylation', 'microarray technology', 'molecular oncology', 'molecular pathology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid hybridization', 'patient oriented research', 'stomach neoplasms']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2004,148500,-0.04627406034813484

"The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of preterm labor have been well documented, but the relative impact of genetic predisposition, as compared to environmental and behavioral factors is not known. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that differential gene expression contributes to disparity in infection-associated preterm labor. A second objective is the creation of two large and novel resources for studying preterm labor: (1) a database of candidate critical genes, and, (2) a human gene expression tissue bank. We suggest that elucidating the pathophysiology of preterm labor requires the power to perform analyses of the fetomaternal interactions required for parturition on a genomic scale. For practical and ethical reasons, a primary study of this type in humans would be severely limited. Therefore, in the first phase of this project, we will use a validated, tightly controlled murine model of infection-induced preterm labor to generate a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression over time in multiple tissues. Preterm pregnant mice will be randomized to treatment groups modeling one of clinical conditions: A. infection with labor; B. infection without labor; C. labor without infection; and D. no infection/no labor. RNA will then be collected from myometrium, ovaries, decidua, placentas and fetal membranes from each of the groups in a time series, and the relative expression of thousands of genes will be analyzed in these samples using DNA microarrays. A similarity metric and a clustering algorithm will be used to categorize individual genes by temporal expression patterns. A novel subtractive strategy will allow us to differentiate transcripts active specifically in infection-induced from those important for infection or labor alone. Inferences will be drawn regarding the involvement of genes not physic represented in the micro arrays by mapping into known functional pathways. The final result of this analysis will be a ""short list"" of candidate genes with potentially critical roles in infection-induced labor. In the second phase of the project, we analyze human tissues (myometrium, placenta, chorion, amnion, decidua, amniocytes and blood) collected from approximately 1360 patients presenting in term and preterm labor in a cross-sectional case-control study matching for race. Expression analysis in these tissues will be targeted to the human homologues of the enriched list of candidate critical genes identified in the mouse. Differential gene expression in pre term labor with or without infection and premature rupture membranes, as well as among different racial groups, will be characterized. A computational tool known as a support vector machine will be used to generate a rank order list predictive of preterm delivery, taking into account historical, clinical and laboratory variables. This tool will identify the subset(s) of genes most likely to form the genetic basis of preterm labor, and may provide a diagnostic molecular profiling instrument for predicting preterm delivery.

"Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   To date, post-genomic analysis has focused on identification and annotation of protein-coding genes and their products. In comparison, the identification of DNA sequences encoding functional RNA has been largely neglected. Functional RNAs can encode trans-acting molecules that interact with other RNAs or proteins, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, RNaseP RNA, small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs; they can also function in cis as untranslated regions that regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that there may be hundreds of unknown functional RNAs in prokaryotes and thousands in eukaryotes.      The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a computational approach to the identification of novel RNA genes and functional RNA elements in complete DNA genomes. Machine learning techniques will be used to recognize hallmarks of functional RNA coding sequences by comparison with sequences that do not encode RNAs. Several types of signals are useful in discriminating functional RNA including: 1) differences in global sequence composition, 2) calculated RNA secondary structure features, i.e. free energy of folding and 3) specific sequence elements common to RNA structure. These and other parameters can be rapidly tried and tested using machine learning methods. This method will be optimized for individual genomes with respect to input databases, parameterization and machine learning method and architecture. Results will be evaluated computationally by cross-validation testing, comparative genomics, and calculated secondary structure and free energy of folding. Experimental studies of RNA expression and function will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators.      Preliminary studies have demonstrated the power of this approach to predict novel functional RNAs in E. coli, other bacteria and archaea as supported by computational cross-validation and experimental confirmation. We will test and apply this approach to discover new functional RNAs in eukaryotic genomes including S. cervisiae, C. elegans, and humans. RNA prediction for these larger and more complex genomes will require the optimization of computational parameters, as well as the development of appropriate input datasets and training algorithms.      The prediction of novel functional RNAs in the human genome presents an opportunity to understand new regulatory and developmental processes. Known RNAs implicated in human disease, such as telomerase RNA (cancer, aging), XIST RNA (X-chromosome inactivation) and BIC (a proto-oncogene) underscore the importance of developing a method to identify the full complement of human RNA genes.         n/a",Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences,6558575,R01HG002665,"['Archaea', ' Caenorhabditis elegans', ' Escherichia coli', ' RNA', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae', ' animal genetic material tag', ' artificial intelligence', ' biotechnology', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' eukaryote', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetic library', ' genetic mapping', ' human genetic material tag', ' mathematical model', ' molecular biology information system', ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' nucleic acid structure', ' prokaryote', ' technology /technique development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2003,377162,0.024464093270553097
"Evolutionary Computation for Gene Expression Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research seeks to develop software that can classify cancers reliably and accurately using gene expression profiling.

The current effort will train and design multilayer feed forward and artificial neural networks using evolutionary optimization techniques for cancer cell class prediction and discovery as well as understanding of the dynamics of gene interaction in a cell. These methods for training and designing neural networks will provide an effective computer-based automatic system that can be used for gene expression profiling.

This will increase the efficiency and efficacy of methods used for screening and diagnosing cancers and increase the likelihood of successful treatment.

"Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma, the second most common cancer in the world, and of its precancerous precursor lesions has become much better elucidated in recent years, but much remains to be discovered. For example, tumor suppressor gene mutation, DNA hypermethylation, microsatellite instability (MSI), and altered gene expression have been shown to occur frequently during the origin and progression of this cancer. However, a greater understanding of these mechanisms and their timing in gastric carcinogenesis could lead to the ultimate development of early detection and staging biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this deadly disease. Therefore, in order to deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gastric carcinogenesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare and contrast the global gene expression patterns of various subtypes and premalignant stages of gastric cancer, using cDNA microarrays and bioinformatics algorithms. 1a) cDNA microarrays will be produced and hybridized to amplified RNA from various histologic subtypes and premalignant stage precursor lesions of gastric cancer. 1b) The bioinformatics programs Cluster/Treeview, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) will be used to derive global gene expression patterns for each subtype of gastric cancer or precursor lesion. During this process, we will also identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed among the various subgroups. 2) To perform a limited methylotyping assay to ascertain epigenetic signatures of different types of gastric cancer and premalignant lesions, focusing on known as well as novel CpG islands in the promoter or upstream regions of genes. 2a) Known methylation targets will be analyzed, including E-cadherin (CDH 1), p 16, p 15, p 14-ARF, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), human mutL homolog 1 (hMLH1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), RASSFIA, deleted in colon carcinoma (DCC), and 14-3-3-sigma. 2b) Novel methylation target searches will be performed using CpG island microarrays, with alternative backup approaches to include methylation-sensitive genomic DNA digestion followed by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), as well as single-gene MSP. 3) To correlate the results of, aims (1) and (2) with each other as well as with other clinical and biologic parameters of these gastric lesions. n/a",Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer,6681360,R21CA098450,"['CpG islands', ' artificial intelligence', ' carcinogenesis', ' carcinoma', ' gene expression', ' human subject', ' informatics', ' methylation', ' microarray technology', ' molecular oncology', ' molecular pathology', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' nucleic acid hybridization', ' patient oriented research', ' stomach neoplasms']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2003,148500,-0.04627406034813484
"Multi-Agent Collaboration for AMD Subtype Classification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries and as such represents a very significant public health problem a number of specific genes, and the discovery, characterization, and eventual therapeutic control of these genes represent major goals of the vision research community. Although the strategies for gene discovery have become very powerful in recent years, there remains a major obstacle to the discovery of genes that underlie common, late-onset diseases like AMD. That obstacle is that clinicians cannot reliably sort patients with different molecular subtypes of late-onset disease into sufficiently homogeneous groups. The purpose of this project is to use the power of multi-agent systems computer technology in a novel way to aid clinicians in the collaborative development of a robust classification system based upon the ophthalmoscopic features of AMD. The result of this project will contribute to an NIH's Innovations in Biomedical Information and Science and Technology Program goal of speeding the progress of biomedical research through the development tools for electronic collaboration that will have impact on broader areas of biomedical research.   We hypothesize that a multi-agent approach to this problem will result in a classification system with greater reproducibility and discriminative power than a system developed by clinicians without such computer assistance. The availability of populations of AMD patients with lower molecular complexity will significantly increase the power of statistical techniques for AMD gene discovery. In addition to this immediate and specific benefit, the strategies we will develop during this project for objectively interfacing medical experts with each other as well as with computers will have applications in the search for other late-onset disease genes as well as in the development of multi-center and multidisciplinary clinical trials of new therapeutic approaches. The proposed system, the Intelligent Distributed Ontology Consensus system (IDOCS) goes beyond conventional groupware by addressing drawbacks to direct, synchronous interaction by providing an autonomously coordinated, asynchronous interaction and collaboration platform among clinicians through their representative intelligent agents.

"Predicting gene attributes from patterns of annotations. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gene Ontology Consortium produces a controlled vocabulary for annotation of gene functions, which has been adopted by many organism-specific gene annotation databases. This allows the prediction of gene function based on partial annotation: if two attributes are strongly correlated in a database, then the presence of one attribute is evidence for the presence of the other. Recent ideas from machine learning, such as dependency networks, may allow more complicated interdependencies between genes and their attributes to be modeled efficiently, which should enable better predictions to be made. Cross-validation will be used to assess the performance of these models, in comparison with linear models and baseline models in which attributes are assumed to be independent. This approach will also be integrated with a probabilistic model of annotation-transfer based on sequence similarity. n/a",Predicting gene attributes from patterns of annotations.,6626288,F32HG002552,"['computer data analysis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetic models', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' postdoctoral investigator']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY (MEDICAL SCHOOL),F32,2003,46420,0.022245901580680388

"CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER Dysfunction of apoptotic pathways plays a critical role in the development of cancer, and the identification and characterization of genes encoding regulators of apoptosis is therefore critical for understanding the pathophysiology of cancer and for developing novel therapeutic approaches. The laboratory has identified CIPER, a gene that regulates both apoptosis and the NF-kB signal transduction pathway, one which is associated with cell survival. Because of this dual function, CIPER appears to play an important role as the control point of a molecular decision-tree; under some circumstances, CIPER may promote apoptosis, while at other times CIPER may favor cell survival. Importantly, the CIPER gene has been found to be located at the chromosomal breakpoint region of t(1;14), a recurrent translocation associated with MALT B-cell lymphoma, and is frequently mutated in lymphomas of various other histologic types as well as some non-lymphoid neoplasms. Our hypothesis is that CIPER promotes tumor development through a combination of dysregulated apoptosis and NF-kB signaling which result from chromosomal mutations affecting the CIPER gene. We are proposing a series of aims to further define the molecular mechanisms by which CIPER controls these signaling pathways, to understand the cellular stimulae which influence CIPER function, and to explore how natural mutations in the CIPER gene affect its important role as a regulator of cell survival.  n/a",CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER,6463554,F32CA088470,"['B cell lymphoma', ' apoptosis', ' biological signal transduction', ' chromosome translocation', ' gene mutation', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplastic transformation', ' nuclear factor kappa beta', ' phosphoproteins', ' regulatory gene', ' tissue /cell culture']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2002,33997,0.00539488208960912
"Predicting gene attributes from patterns of annotations. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gene Ontology Consortium produces a controlled vocabulary for annotation of gene functions, which has been adopted by many organism-specific gene annotation databases. This allows the prediction of gene function based on partial annotation: if two attributes are strongly correlated in a database, then the presence of one attribute is evidence for the presence of the other. Recent ideas from machine learning, such as dependency networks, may allow more complicated interdependencies between genes and their attributes to be modeled efficiently, which should enable better predictions to be made. Cross-validation will be used to assess the performance of these models, in comparison with linear models and baseline models in which attributes are assumed to be independent. This approach will also be integrated with a probabilistic model of annotation-transfer based on sequence similarity. n/a",Predicting gene attributes from patterns of annotations.,6488035,F32HG002552,"['computer data analysis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetic models', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' postdoctoral investigator']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY (MEDICAL SCHOOL),F32,2002,38320,0.022245901580680388
"INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES As a step toward understanding the complex differences between normal and cancer cells, much research has been devoted to analyses of genes that are differentially expressed in particular cells.  Though recent technological advances have made it possible to conduct serial and/or simultaneous analysis of the expression patterns of thousands of genes, no comprehensive study has been reported on how many genes are expressed differentially and whether most differences are cell line-specific.  The long- term goal of this research is to develop intelligent data mapping and visual explanation technologies to improve information exploration and interpretation from high-throughput gene expression profiles for molecular analysis of cancer. Suggested by preliminary evidence from mRNA profiles of breast/prostate cancer cells that transcriptome patterns are rich in information about mechanisms that underlie cancer development, in the R21 research, multidisciplinary knowledge of molecular biology and computational intelligence are applied to (1) design cost effective molecular experiments to establish gene transcriptome distributions across cell lines, (2) pilot test the existence of transcriptome clusters in the molecular species space that correlate to cell phenotypes, and (3) identify key biomarkers that differentiate different cell lines with the highest prediction values.  Since new knowledge can only be further acquired by exploring all of the interesting aspects of complex transcriptome data in high-dimensional space, in this R33 application a statistically principled hierarchical visual exploration technique is proposed to effectively reveal and interpret the intrinsic but hidden characteristics of transcriptome clusters that should better define the nature of cancer biology and therapeutic targets.  A novel integration of information theory and computer graphics will permit (1) an automatic identification and modeling of biomarker clusters, (2) a probabilistic component analysis to form hierarchical visualization spaces allowing the complete data set to be analyzed at the top level with best separated sub-clusters analyzed at deeper levels, and (3) an interactive intelligent interface for task/hypothesis driven data mining and decision making.

"The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of preterm labor have been well documented, but the relative impact of genetic predisposition, as compared to environmental and behavioral factors is not known. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that differential gene expression contributes to disparity in infection-associated preterm labor. A second objective is the creation of two large and novel resources for studying preterm labor: (1) a database of candidate critical genes, and, (2) a human gene expression tissue bank. We suggest that elucidating the pathophysiology of preterm labor requires the power to perform analyses of the fetomaternal interactions required for parturition on a genomic scale. For practical and ethical reasons, a primary study of this type in humans would be severely limited. Therefore, in the first phase of this project, we will use a validated, tightly controlled murine model of infection-induced preterm labor to generate a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression over time in multiple tissues. Preterm pregnant mice will be randomized to treatment groups modeling one of clinical conditions: A. infection with labor; B. infection without labor; C. labor without infection; and D. no infection/no labor. RNA will then be collected from myometrium, ovaries, decidua, placentas and fetal membranes from each of the groups in a time series, and the relative expression of thousands of genes will be analyzed in these samples using DNA microarrays. A similarity metric and a clustering algorithm will be used to categorize individual genes by temporal expression patterns. A novel subtractive strategy will allow us to differentiate transcripts active specifically in infection-induced from those important for infection or labor alone. Inferences will be drawn regarding the involvement of genes not physic represented in the micro arrays by mapping into known functional pathways. The final result of this analysis will be a ""short list"" of candidate genes with potentially critical roles in infection-induced labor. In the second phase of the project, we analyze human tissues (myometrium, placenta, chorion, amnion, decidua, amniocytes and blood) collected from approximately 1360 patients presenting in term and preterm labor in a cross-sectional case-control study matching for race. Expression analysis in these tissues will be targeted to the human homologues of the enriched list of candidate critical genes identified in the mouse. Differential gene expression in pre term labor with or without infection and premature rupture membranes, as well as among different racial groups, will be characterized. A computational tool known as a support vector machine will be used to generate a rank order list predictive of preterm delivery, taking into account historical, clinical and laboratory variables. This tool will identify the subset(s) of genes most likely to form the genetic basis of preterm labor, and may provide a diagnostic molecular profiling instrument for predicting preterm delivery.

"GenePattern: Methodologies and Software Tools.  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years there have been exciting breakthroughs in the application of computational methods to problems in cancer genomics. Machine learning techniques applied to gene expression data have been used to address the questions of distinguishing tumor morphology, predicting post-treatment outcome, and finding molecular markers for disease. While these studies have been very promising, significant challenges remain. Extracting biological knowledge from microarray-based gene expression data is difficult. The development of robust and accurate expression-based classifiers of biological and clinical states is similarly problematic. Biologists do not have access to an integrated set of robust, sophisticated analytical tools.  Our goal is to develop, implement, and distribute computational genomics methods that address these challenges in the gene expression profiling field.  Aim 1: Capture the behavior of a set of genes representing a pathway or state of the cell to reduce a list of thousands of expressed genes into a few hundred metagenes. Metagenes should filter the noise, technical variation, and idiosyncrasies of the data, and capture the actual molecular logic or relevant biological correlations and structure in the data.  Aim 2: Develop a robust and validated computational methodology for using metagene markers for classification.  Aim 3: Develop and distribute an integrated software package, GenePattern, to put the power of sophisticated computational methods into the hands of the biomedical research community.  Our extensive experience developing methods, analyzing patient sample data, and creating and distributing software tools for this area of research makes us well suited to carry out this program. n/a",GenePattern: Methodologies and Software Tools.,6548915,R33CA097556,"['analytical method', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' form /pattern perception', ' functional /structural genomics', ' gene expression', ' genetic library', ' genetic screening', ' mathematical model', ' method development', ' microarray technology', ' molecular shape', ' phenotype', ' technology /technique development']",NCI,WHITEHEAD INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL RES,R33,2002,738248,0.032463192051699494
"FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Granule cell precursors of the cerebellum        undergo exuberant proliferation and subsequent differentiation during postnatal      days 1-21 (Pl-21) in the mouse. Granule cells are also thought, to give rise to      medulloblastoma, a brain tumor primarily affecting children. This proposal is        aimed at characterizing gene expression profiles during the highly                   proliferative phase of cerebellar development in the postnatal mouse. Existing       analytical methods for elucidating the functional relationships between genes        expressed in cells typically fall to account for significant sources of              variation (i.e., ""noise"") inherent in the data. This problem will only be            compounded as analysis progresses from unicellular organisms to complex tissues      such as the developing CNS. The hypothesis driving the proposed research plan        is that improved classification and clustering techniques in functional              genomics can be obtained by incorporating sources of variation/noise into the        analytic method. The proposed work will utilize a model system of the                developing mouse cerebellum, from which improved methods for the interpretation      of complex, DNA microarray-based gene expression data will be developed.                                                                                                  Aim 1 is to generate a gene expression data set (consisting of the analysis of       19,000 genes) from the newborn and neonatal mouse cerebellum at various              developmental stages (P1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 30). Math-1 is a basic               helix-loop-helix transcription factor with essential roles in cerebellar             granule cell development. We will utilize transgenic mice in which selectable        reporter genes (e.g., jellyfish green fluorescent protein, GFP) are expressed        under control of the granule precursor cell-specific Math-1 enhancer. This will      allow for further subdivision into proliferating, immature granule cell              (Math-1-positive) and other cell types (Math-1-negative) by fluorescent cell         activated sorting (FACS). Aim 2- The time series obtained in Aim 1 will be           analyzed in both the time and frequency domain, using Fourier transforms of the      expression data. Classification and clustering techniques that fully exploit         the ""noise models"" developed in Aim 1 will be applied to these time series. In       Aim 3 we will screen candidate genes/ESTs to confirm appropriate                     spatio-temporal-specific expression in developing cerebellar granule cells from      P0-P21 using a high throughput in situ hybridization protocol.

Evaluation of         the quality of data will be assessed through a combination of factors that           measure how well-known functional groupings are reflected in the output.             Efficiency and scalability will be measured through timed runs of MicroExplore       on a set of expression datasets of various sizes. Our study will focus on the        complex dataset of lymphoid gene expression belonging to an intramural NCI           laboratory. In the second phase, a novel hybrid approach will be designed to         utilize the results of multiple clustering algorithms and configurations to          achieve a ranked set of best overall clusters. Attempts to integrate external        data sources will add new dimensions to the analysis tool and provide for            powerful predictions.                                                                                                                                                     Improving the scientist's ability to accurately and efficiently identify which       candidate genes would make good therapeutics will be a fundamental step for          the advancement of cancer research and scientific discovery. MicroExplore will       be a valuable resource for the continuance of gene discovery and                     characterization. This platform will have strong potential for the enhancement       of clinical data analysis helping to characterize or profile the molecular           changes found in normal, precancerous and malignant tissue samples.                                                                                                       n/a",INNOVATIVE ALGORITHMS FOR MICROARRAY ANALYSIS,6070441,R21CA084739,"['artificial intelligence', ' gene expression', ' genetic mapping', ' information systems', ' mathematics', ' method development', ' microarray technology']",NCI,"SRA INTERNATIONAL, INC.",R21,2000,173501,0.019543285056059116

Recent genome-wide expression studies establish that cancerous            cells display global alterations in transcript abundance that i) determine           neoplastic behavior and ii) predict clinical course and outcome.

"CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER Dysfunction of apoptotic pathways plays a critical role in the development of cancer, and the identification and characterization of genes encoding regulators of apoptosis is therefore critical for understanding the pathophysiology of cancer and for developing novel therapeutic approaches. The laboratory has identified CIPER, a gene that regulates both apoptosis and the NF-kB signal transduction pathway, one which is associated with cell survival. Because of this dual function, CIPER appears to play an important role as the control point of a molecular decision-tree; under some circumstances, CIPER may promote apoptosis, while at other times CIPER may favor cell survival. Importantly, the CIPER gene has been found to be located at the chromosomal breakpoint region of t(1;14), a recurrent translocation associated with MALT B-cell lymphoma, and is frequently mutated in lymphomas of various other histologic types as well as some non-lymphoid neoplasms. Our hypothesis is that CIPER promotes tumor development through a combination of dysregulated apoptosis and NF-kB signaling which result from chromosomal mutations affecting the CIPER gene. We are proposing a series of aims to further define the molecular mechanisms by which CIPER controls these signaling pathways, to understand the cellular stimulae which influence CIPER function, and to explore how natural mutations in the CIPER gene affect its important role as a regulator of cell survival.  n/a",CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER,6208105,F32CA088470,"['B cell lymphoma', ' apoptosis', ' biological signal transduction', ' chromosome translocation', ' gene mutation', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplastic transformation', ' nuclear factor kappa beta', ' phosphoproteins', ' regulatory gene', ' tissue /cell culture']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2000,46300,0.00539488208960912
"INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES As a step toward understanding the complex differences between normal and cancer cells, much research has been devoted to analyses of genes that are differentially expressed in particular cells.  Though recent technological advances have made it possible to conduct serial and/or simultaneous analysis of the expression patterns of thousands of genes, no comprehensive study has been reported on how many genes are expressed differentially and whether most differences are cell line-specific.  The long- term goal of this research is to develop intelligent data mapping and visual explanation technologies to improve information exploration and interpretation from high-throughput gene expression profiles for molecular analysis of cancer. Suggested by preliminary evidence from mRNA profiles of breast/prostate cancer cells that transcriptome patterns are rich in information about mechanisms that underlie cancer development, in the R21 research, multidisciplinary knowledge of molecular biology and computational intelligence are applied to (1) design cost effective molecular experiments to establish gene transcriptome distributions across cell lines, (2) pilot test the existence of transcriptome clusters in the molecular species space that correlate to cell phenotypes, and (3) identify key biomarkers that differentiate different cell lines with the highest prediction values.  Since new knowledge can only be further acquired by exploring all of the interesting aspects of complex transcriptome data in high-dimensional space, in this R33 application a statistically principled hierarchical visual exploration technique is proposed to effectively reveal and interpret the intrinsic but hidden characteristics of transcriptome clusters that should better define the nature of cancer biology and therapeutic targets.  A novel integration of information theory and computer graphics will permit (1) an automatic identification and modeling of biomarker clusters, (2) a probabilistic component analysis to form hierarchical visualization spaces allowing the complete data set to be analyzed at the top level with best separated sub-clusters analyzed at deeper levels, and (3) an interactive intelligent interface for task/hypothesis driven data mining and decision making.  The innovative nature of the research relies on the concept of combining (1) a hybrid stepwise nonlinear discriminant analysis for biomarker identification and (2) a hierarchical visual exploration of multi-foci high-dimensional transcriptome distribution to interpret the complex relationships between molecular events and cell phenotypes.  n/a",INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES,6174109,R21CA083231,"['breast neoplasms', ' computer simulation', ' estrogen inhibitor', ' gene expression', ' genetic mapping', ' genetic markers', ' genetic screening', ' genetic transcription', ' information display', ' information theory', ' mathematical model', ' messenger RNA', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' phenotype', ' prostate neoplasms', ' statistics /biometry', ' structural biology', ' technology /technique development', ' transcription factor']",NCI,CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA,R21,2000,147648,-0.0031300600733419085
"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,9992249,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,30514,-0.02528236861021987
"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,10022122,F32GM134595,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Freedom', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human data', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical sciences', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,67446,0.009296891345181166
"Causal Effect Estimation of Regulatory Molecules Project Summary/Abstract Transcription factors and microRNAs are essential regulatory molecules (RM) that control messenger RNAs (mRNA) and are known to be dysregulated in human diseases. Each RM may affect multiple pathways of the cell which is both a blessing and a curse. If a therapy targets the proper RM, it can attack the disease from multiple fronts and increase efficacy. On the other hand, targeted therapy may result in serious adverse effects due to our limited knowledge of the downstream causal effect of RM manipulation. Although the local bindings between single RMs and their targets have been studied computationally and experimentally, the intensity of functional consequences of such bindings on the transcriptome is unclear. Here, I propose statistical machine learning techniques and causal inference methods to predict the observed variability of gene expression using only regulatory molecules and estimate their downstream causal effect on the entire transcriptome. To achieve this goal, I start in Aim 1 by building a multi-response predictive model to predict the whole transcriptome using only RMs. This goal is challenging because the dimension of the response vector is more than the number of samples and I will use techniques from high-dimensional statistics to address this issue. In Aim 2, I will go beyond predictive modeling by estimating the causal effect of RMs on the transcriptome using invariant causal prediction. I will leverage the rapidly growing literature which connects causal inference to invariant prediction accuracy across heterogeneous data sources to infer the causal effect of RMs on mRNA. Having developed both predictive and causal models of RMs contribution to gene regulation, in Aim 3 during the R00 phase, I will focus on the most recent advances in double/debiased machine learning which allows the use of scalable machine learning methods for reliable estimation of causal effect of RMs on transcription. My proposed research will bring the most advanced statistical machine learning and causal inference techniques to genomics research and help design more effective targeted therapies by providing insights into the global role of RMs in gene expression regulation. During the training phase of the award, with the support of my outstanding mentoring team and scientific advisory committee, I will gain expertise in molecular biology and genomics while perfecting my knowledge of causal inference and machine learning. The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Hospital and the Mathematical Biosciences Institute will provide me with the ideal interdisciplinary environment to bridge data science and genomics and will help me achieve my career development goals and transition to a tenure-track faculty position. Project Narrative Targeting regulatory elements has the advantage of concurrently attacking multiple damaged pathways, with the possible pitfall of toxicity due to adverse unintended effects. Understanding the functional global impact of therapy on the entire transcriptome will guide us in designing drugs with higher efficacy and lower toxicity.

"Systems Biology of Shape and Size Regulation Abstract The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes. This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology, which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays. Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine. Project Narrative The genetic regulation of the shape and size of internal organs and whole body is crucial during development, regeneration, and homeostasis.

"Algorithmic approaches to systems biology, data integration, and evolution My group continued to develop and apply computational methods that utilize and integrate large data sets to study gene regulation and diseases. We also develop methods to analyze data produced My group continued to develop and apply computational methods that utilize and integrate large data sets with a focus on gene regulation and diseases. We also developed new methods to analyze data produced by new, high throughput, technologies and experimental techniques such as single cell gene expression and HT-SELEX data. In our studies we use variety of algorithmic techniques including Integer Linear Programming (ILP) among other optimization strategies as well as Machine Learning approaches, including Hidden Markov Models and Deep Learning. Within this general area, the main focus of my group is on developing new computational methods allowing to utilize large cancer-related datasets (e.g. TCGA and ICGC) to obtain insists into etiology of cancer. Together with our experimental collaborators we also utilize new experimental data to obtain novel insights  into fundamental biological processes.    Much of the effort of the group during this reporting period has been devoted to studying of mutational patterns in cancer genomes. Specifically, through their lifetime, individuals acquire somatic mutations which might eventually led to cancer.  These mutations often display characteristic patterns known as mutational signatures. Understanding relation between these patterns and their causes can provide important insights to  into tumorigenesis in general and environmental contributions to cancer in particular. The two fundamental question in this area are  (i) what is the best way to characterize these mutation patterns and (ii)  leveraging  such patterns of somatic mutations for understanding of mutagenic processes shaping   human genome.  One of the most challenging obstacles to a full characterization of mutational patterns comes from the fact that these patterns are the end-effect of several interplaying factors including carcinogenic exposures and potential deficiencies of the DNA repair mechanism. Separating these factors in nontrivial and thus the current methods typically do not attempt such separation assuming linear  combination model.  Yet, to fully understand the nature of each signature, it is important to disambiguate the atomic components that contribute to the final signature. As the first step in this direction   we recently  introduced a new descriptor of mutational signatures, DNA Repair FootPrint (RePrint) (1).   Our work demonstrated, for the first time, that it is possible to identify signatures that include common DNA repair deficiency independent on the other mutagenic processes that contribute to the composite signature.   We validated the method with published mutational signatures from cell lines targeted with CRISPR-Cas9-based knockouts of DNA repair genes.  The second line of research related to mutational signatures is the identification of mutagenic processes underlying mutational signatures.  To investigate the genetic aberrations associated with mutational signatures, we took a network-based approach considering mutational signatures as cancer phenotypes. Specifically, our analysis aimed to answer the following two complementary questions: (i) what are functional pathways whose gene expression activities correlate with the strengths of mutational signatures, and (ii) are there pathways whose genetic alterations might have led to specific mutational signatures? To identify mutated pathways, we adopted a recently developed optimization method based on integer linear programming. Analyzing a breast cancer dataset, we identified pathways associated with mutational signatures on both expression and mutation levels. Our analysis captured important differences in the etiology of the APOBEC-related signatures and the two clock-like signatures. In particular, it revealed that clustered and dispersed APOBEC mutations may be caused by different mutagenic processes. In addition, our analysis elucidated differences between two age-related signatures-one of the signatures is correlated with the expression of cell cycle genes while the other has no such correlation but shows patterns consistent with the exposure to environmental/external processes. This work investigated, for the first time, a network-level association of mutational signatures and dysregulated pathways. The identified pathways and subnetworks provide novel insights into mutagenic processes that the cancer genomes might have undergone and important clues for developing personalized drug therapies (2). In addition, we collaborated with Roded Sharans group  from TAU, to   provide a first probabilistic model of mutational signatures that accounts for context dependency and strand coordination (3).  Finally, we started a research leveraging the concept mutational to study the relationship of smoking and expression ACE2 and other proteins  known to be involved in the  entrance the Coronavirus 2s (SARS-CoV-2) into the host cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We also continued our research on methods to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs). These networks describe regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes. Following the development of NetREX (Network Reprogramming using EXpression) technique to for constructing  context-specific GRN given context-specific expression data and a context-agnostic prior network (reported last year), we developed  NetREX-CF. The important novelty of NetREX-CF is the ability to deal with missing data.  Specifically, NetREX-CF reconstruction approach that brings together a modern machine learning strategy (Collaborative Filtering model) and a biologically justified model of gene expression (sparse Network Component Analysis based model). The Collaborative Filtering (CF) is able to overcome the incompleteness of the prior knowledge and make edge recommends for building the GRN. Complementing CF, we use the sparse Network Component Analysis (NCA) to validate the recommended edges. Finally,  we combine these two approaches using a novel data integration method and show that the new approach outperforms the currently leading GRN reconstruction methods. Our preliminary results show that this method drastically outperform previous approaches. This work has been selected for oral presentation RECOMB 2020  and the manuscript in preparation.   My group also continues to develop software for public use including AptaBlocks Online -- a web-based toolkit for the In silico design of RNA complexes (4)  and  JUDY  a flexible bioinformatics pipeline for diverse types of bioinformatics analysis (5). nWe also provided computational expertise and analysis of the specialized sequencing data,    mRNA display, that our collaborators  used for comparison of the performance of Linear, Monocyclic, and Bicyclic Libraries (6). n/a","Algorithmic approaches to systems biology, data integration, and evolution",10268080,ZIALM200887,"['2019-nCoV', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronavirus', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Disorder', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Growth Factor Gene', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuscripts', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Oral', 'Pathologic Mutagenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rod', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biological systems', 'cancer genome', 'carcinogenicity', 'cdc Genes', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'gene function', 'graph theory', 'heterogenous data', 'high throughput technology', 'in silico', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'markov model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision drugs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumorigenesis']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2020,1385188,-0.005250288652129514
"A next-generation morbid map of the human genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on gene discovery and molecular diagnostics for Mendelian conditions (MCs) is hard to overstate. However, to provide affected individuals with precise natural history, recurrence risk, and prognosis in clinical settings, identification of pathogenic variant(s)/genotypes alone is often insufficient. This is a challenge most notably for genes that cause more than one MC or ~25% of all genes that underlie MCs. In such an instance, even with a known genotype a patient's phenotype has to be compared to that of all MCs caused by variants in a gene to determine which MC, if any, is the likely diagnosis or whether patient instead has a novel condition. This comparison is increasingly difficult because delineation of the ~5,100 MCs currently known has typically been based on subjective grouping of affected individuals by phenotypic similarity. We propose to develop a quantitative framework for assessing overlap among the distributions of phenotypes due to pathogenic genotypes the same gene and apply this framework genome-wide. NGS has enabled identification of causal genotypes in hundreds of thousands of individuals with MCs, providing a sufficiently large dataset that it is now feasible to use machine learning to quantitatively and systematically identify “clusters” of co-occurring genotypes and phenotypic features for each known gene. We will refine and validate our approach by comparing differences between conventionally-delineated and quantitatively-delineated MCs and by assessing the similarity of individuals with well-studied atypical phenotypes/genotypes to quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will then apply the optimal strategy across the genome to generate a “next- generation morbid map” based on quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will also apply machine learning approaches to identify genomic properties associated with the propensity for each gene to underlie multiple MCs (i.e., the numeric contribution of each gene to the morbid map or phenotropy). This will enable a more precise and complete understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of each MC, enable more objective diagnosis of individuals with atypical phenotypes, and more robustly identify the existence of multiple MCs among individuals with non-specific “class” phenotypes (e.g., developmental delay, autism, hearing impairment). We will make all newly developed methods publicly available via interactive and programmatic web-based tools to facilitate extension of this work to other human and model organism datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of this project are to develop a quantitative framework that enables objective delineation of Mendelian conditions, apply the framework to systematically delineate conditions across all genes known to underlie a Mendelian condition, and predict the number of conditions due to each gene. This framework will provide a fuller, unbiased characterization of the genotypic/phenotypic spectrum for all Mendelian conditions, enable more precise diagnoses and counseling of individuals with difficult to diagnose phenotypes, and accelerate the detection of new Mendelian conditions.",A next-generation morbid map of the human genome,10047366,R35HG011297,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'hearing impairment', 'large datasets', 'molecular diagnostics', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2020,466172,0.003210340243209568
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9995573,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,480000,0.027487916304933642
"Functional annotation of new genes aided by deep learning New genes (NGs) are generated by multiple mechanisms and their end-piece sequences are identified as the chimeric transcript sequence from multiple human sources including healthy and disease tissues. Therefore, NGs have been recognized as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision medicine. Many efforts have been made to study individual NG function and to identify relevant drug targets. However, the current in-depth research and achievements are mainly concentrated on several driver NGs, and classical cancer drugs have been directly used to target the NG domains, such as the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 fusion protein in leukemia. Some of the fusion proteins with retaining DNA-binding domains such as transcription factors can directly bind their target genes, such as the EWSR1-FLI fusion actively recruiting BAF complex. Recently, the downstream effectors of driver FGs have emerged as therapeutic targets. For example, targeting the downstream CCND2 inhibited RUNX1/ETO-driven leukemic expansion in vitro and in vivo and inhibition of STAT5, the downstream factor of NUP214-ABL1 led to the induction of leukemia cell death. However, the functions of most identified FGs have not been systematically investigated. This is mainly due to the limitations of traditional tools and the high cost of experimental procedures. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new tools for analyzing NG breakpoint-specific features systemically in the human genome and predict their originating and regulatory mechanisms, such as upstream and downstream effectors. In-depth annotation based on NG structure is important for understanding the cellular mechanisms of NGs. Effective use of systematic bioinformatics tools for functional annotation can provide a deeper insight into the role of NGs in the development and progression of diseases such as cancers to find direct and indirect therapeutic targets. In this study, we will develop five bioinformatics tools for the functional annotation and feature analysis of NGs, a predictive pipeline for automatic analysis of downstream effects of NGs, and a predictive method for tracing the origin of NGs. This project will be a substantial contribution to public health by systematicallydeep annotating thefunction of new genes (NGs) in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. These systematic annotation results will be performed through ChimerAnno (a tool for functional annotation of human chimeric genes), FGviewer (a tool for visualizing multi-tiered functional features of fusion genes), NGeffector with DeepChIP (a tool for predicting NG downstream effectors with enhanced transcription factor binding site prediction with deep learning), DeepCLIP (a tool for providing evidence of origin of NGs for trans-splicing mechanism) and hBPAI (a tool for feature extraction of human new genes' breakpoint (BP)). The application of these approaches on all kinds of human BPs of new genes will be integrated into NewGeneDB, New Gene annotation Database. This study will advance our knowledge in NG regulatory mechanisms in diseases and open up the possibility of novel treatments of cancer tools and platforms for analyzing NGs. and other diseases in the future by providing powerful",Functional annotation of new genes aided by deep learning,10029297,R35GM138184,"['ABL1 gene', 'Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Markers', 'CCND2 gene', 'Cell Death', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'EWSR1 gene', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'NUP214 gene', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'RUNX1 gene', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stat5 protein', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Splicing', 'Transcript', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'chimeric gene', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'feature extraction', 'fusion gene', 'gene function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R35,2020,334778,-0.022174105128056707

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery.

"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling,10016780,K99HG010910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Biological Transport', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterochromatin', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Motors', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Outer Mitochondrial Membrane', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'active control', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell fixation', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education resources', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genomic tools', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanometer', 'neuropathology', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'ribosome profiling', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,81284,0.028104233632479804
"Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo. ABSTRACT: “Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo”  microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small regulatory RNAs involved in repression of gene expression. They recognize their target mRNAs though base pairing and upon binding, trigger translational repression, deadenylation and decay of the target mRNAs. Given that each miRNA has the potential to regulate hundreds of genes, and several dozens of miRNAs are expressed in each cell type, miRNAs are one of the master regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and virus. Thus, the elucidation of the miRNA complement is essential to understand gene regulation and mRNA turnover. The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method for miRNA discovery and experimental validation in vivo.  Current miRNA discovery methods heavily rely on providing sequencing evidence of a small RNA that fits into a hairpin-like structure predicted bioinformatically. The problem is that sample availability or the abundance of a specific cell type in a tissue may be limited and hamper the number of miRNAs that can be backed-up with sequencing support. In these situations, the current solution is to sequence deeper, increasing overall costs. On the other hand, the presence of a small RNA of ~22-nt does not guarantee the belonging to the miRNA family, as random degradation of cellular RNAs also will produce small RNAs of this size and only tedious experimental validation of their processing into intermediate species and mature miRNA can confirm their identity.  A recent curation work found that of the over ~7,000 metazoan miRNAs in miRBase, the reference miRNA database, only 1,175 fulfilled the features necessary to pass as miRNAs, directly rejected 3,470 as false positives and lacked enough sequencing evidence to call another 2,105 miRNAs. Therefore, there is an unmet technological need to develop a miRNA validation method that boosts the access to the miRNA candidates even from limited samples and that allows rigorous multiplexed experimental validation of their processing.  With the synergy of an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in microRNAs and zebrafish manipulation (Dr. Cifuentes, PI) and bioinformatics (Dr. Moxon, co-I), we will develop miRAGe (miRNA Analysis Genome wide), a high-throughput method to integrate miRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. The fundamental concept behind miRAGe is the use of living cells as “organic computers” to analyze miRNA processing. We will use massively parallel oligo pool synthesis to prepare the miRNA candidate precursors and test their processing in injected zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing will determine which candidates are true microRNA by detecting their ~22-nucleotide mature product and their stereotypic intermediates.  Overall, the results from this project will transform the access of the scientific community to high quality, experimentally validated miRNA data from any organism with genomic data available, thus enhancing future transversal studies on post-transcriptional regulation. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method to integrate microRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. We will take advantage of oligo pool synthesis to prepare the microRNA candidate precursors and test their processing after injection in zebrafish embryos.

"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear. In this project, we propose that by combining information about the gene activity and epigenetic landscapes of interneurons across multiple species we will generate an integrated, multi-layered portrait of interneuron diversity which we can use to understand brain",Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity,9898481,K99MH120050,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Lateral Geniculate Body', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental neurobiology', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'methylome', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills training', 'student mentoring', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,K99,2020,118421,-0.0004992866794076064
"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggset that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcripition in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields. Project Narrative Diaphragmatic hernias and cardiovascular malformations are serious birth defects. In this study, we will use bioinformatics and mouse models to identify genes that cause these birth defects and to learn how they work. These experiments will help us to understand how the diaphragm and heart form prior to birth and may ultimately lead to new ways of treating or preventing these birth defects.",Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development,9972190,R01HD098458,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Association Learning', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital diaphragmatic hernia', 'Cytogenetics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diaphragmatic Hernia', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Encyclopedias', 'Endocardium', 'Endothelium', 'Foundations', 'GATA4 gene', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Hernia', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Mesenchymal', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Role', 'SOX7 gene', 'Source', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'WNT4 gene', 'Work', 'biochip', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cardiogenesis', 'congenital anomaly', 'data modeling', 'dosage', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'genome database', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'microdeletion', 'molecular sequence database', 'mortality', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'research study', 'septal defect', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web based interface']",NICHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,457528,0.01927367998252688
"Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases Project Summary/Abstract Many diseases are understudied because they are rare or of little public interest. The effect of each understudied disease may be limited, but the cumulative effects of all these diseases could be profound. One common research challenge for these diseases is that the resources allocated to each is often limited. For instance, large- scale screening of drugs is often challenging, if not possible, in small labs. The decreasing costs of next generation sequencing make possible the generation of gene expression profiles of understudied disease samples. Integrating these expression profiles with other open data provides tremendous opportunities to gain insights into disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutics for understudied diseases. We have utilized a systems-based approach that employs gene expression profiles of disease samples and drug-induced gene expression profiles from cancer cell lines to predict new therapeutic candidates for hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma and basal cell carcinoma. All these candidates were successfully validated in preclinical models. The success of this approach relies on multiscale procedures, such as quality control of disease samples, selection of appropriate reference tissues, evaluation of disease signatures, and weighting cell lines. There is a plethora of relevant datasets and analysis modules that are publicly available, yet are isolated in distinct silos, making it tedious to implement this approach in translational research. A centralized informatics system that allows prediction of therapeutics for further experimental validation is thus of great interest to researchers working on understudied diseases. Accordingly, we propose four specific aims: 1) developing novel deep learning methods to select precise reference normal tissues for disease signature creation, 2) developing computational methods to reuse drug profiles from other disease models for drug prediction, 3) integrating open efficacy data to identify new targets from the systems-based approach, and 4) developing a centralized platform and promoting the platform in the scientific community. This proposal will reuse several big open databases (e.g., TCGA, TARGET, GTEx, GEO, LINCS, CTRP, GDSC) and employ cutting-edge informatics methods (e.g., deep learning). To demonstrate the scalability of the system, we will investigate three representative understudied diseases: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Aim 1), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (Aim 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Aim 3). Successful implementation of the systems-based approach can be used as a model for using other large open omics (proteins, metabolites) to discover therapeutics for diseases with unmet needs. This proposal will bring together experts in informatics, statistics, computer science, and physicians from Michigan State University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Spectrum Health. All data and code will be released to the public for continuing development. The system will be deployed to our OCTAD portal (http://octad.org), an open workplace for therapeutic discovery. Project Narrative About 25 million people are living with understudied diseases in the U.S. Although there are voluminous high dimensional molecular datasets that could be leveraged for research, individual labs have limited computational capacity to translate these molecular features into therapeutic hits. We propose to build a centralized information system that allows individual labs to easily harness open gene expression datasets and generate new therapeutic targets or drug candidates for further experimental validation.",Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases,9998976,R01GM134307,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Asia', 'Basal Cell', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Cancer cell line', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evaluation', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Ramp', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cancer gene expression', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'disorder control', 'drug candidate', 'drug mechanism', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'overexpression', 'pill', 'protein metabolite', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,413916,0.019718953706267778
"Genomic and epigenomic mechanisms of pediatric ocular disorders The Medical Genetics and Ophthalmic Genomics Laboratory has advanced the goals and objectives of the research program as follows:  1. Modeling novel associations of ocular syndromes with coding gene variation in zebrafish, mouse, and in vitro using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and developmental, molecular, and cellular biology investigations to elucidate disease mechanisms. We are currently modeling several new human disease genes in animal and cellular models. One example is CSDE1, a cold-shock domain containing RNA-binding program. We have shown that haploinsufficiency of this gene in humans causes a novel neurodevelopemntal disorder with autistic like features, short stature, relative microcephaly, and in some cases iris coloboma. This is consistent with contiguous gene deletions in humans, framing CSDE1 as the critical gene for 1p13.2 microdeletion syndrome. This manuscript is currently in press (Science Advances, 2019). Our group has also acted in collaboration to define multiple additional new disease-gene associations, including SMPD4, BMPR1A, and MYRF (see bibliography).  2. Defining disease-associations in the noncoding genome and in eye tissues using functional genomics techniques. Using RNAseq, ATACseq, and Hi-C, along with single-cell sequencing technologies, we are mapping the active genome in human ocular cells derived from induced pluripotent cell lines for variant prioritization from human sequencing data.

"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions. The results from the project will lead to novel computational tools for understanding disease mechanism at molecular level and for the rational design of RNA-based therapeutics. !",New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures,9851572,R35GM134919,"['Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hybrids', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Physics', 'Play', 'RNA', 'RNA Computations', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene therapy', 'genomic RNA', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'polyanion', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2020,240392,0.041422548770082085
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,9898392,R35GM131845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth', 'Hermaphroditism', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'autosome', 'chromatin modification', 'condensin', 'dosage', 'histone demethylase', 'male', 'man', 'neural network', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'sex', 'sex determination', 'single molecule', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2020,466290,-0.0007778859390104767
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands.

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9979887,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,400001,0.013110703909161634
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases.

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9983714,R01GM123037,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'structured data', 'support vector machine', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,302225,-0.017270856911642325
"Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are a cause of premature deaths, responsible for up to 8% of sudden deaths in industrialized countries. Identifying individuals at risk for TAAD allows for medical management that prevents deaths due to dissections. We determined that up to 20% of TAAD patients without a known genetic syndrome have a family history of TAAD, which is inherited primarily in an autosomal dominant manner (termed heritable thoracic aortic disease, HTAD). We established a cohort of HTAD families (842 families with two or more members with TAAD) and used this cohort to identify novel HTAD genes. Positional cloning and candidate gene approaches by our lab and others have successfully identified 18 genes for HTAD. We hypothesize that there are multiple altered genes yet to be identified, disrupting known and novel molecular pathways responsible for thoracic aortic disease, and responsible for disease in the unsolved HTAD families. The overarching goal of the project is to identify the remaining genes for HTAD, characterize the phenotype associated with these novel genes, perform initial molecular studies linking the mutant gene to aortic disease, and rapidly translate these findings into improved clinical care and prevention of premature deaths due to aortic dissection in HTAD families. The proposed aims are: (1) Recruit and characterize additional HTAD families to be used to identify novel genes, and delineate the clinical features and mutation spectrum associated with new genes; (2) Pursue exome/genome sequencing on HTAD cases and use the genetic strategies to identify novel genes, including segregation of rare variants in affected relatives and trios (affected proband and unaffected parents) and burden analyses; (3) Pursue a machine-learning approach using exome data from HTAD families and controls to identify novel disease genes; (4) Perform initial molecular and cellular biology studies of novel HTAD genes to confirm a link between the mutant gene and thoracic aortic disease. In summary, we are uniquely poised to identify novel HTAD genes using our assembled cohort and are proposing both proven and novel strategies to identify additional HTAD genes. Uncovering HTAD genes is crucial for identifying individuals at risk for aortic dissections and initiating gene-specific clinical management to prevent premature death due to dissections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute aortic dissections are a common cause of premature death in the United States. The goal of the proposed research is to prevent premature deaths due to dissections by identifying individuals who are predisposed by uncovering all the genetic variants in the human genome that trigger dissection.",Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections,10053081,R01HL109942,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Survival', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dissection', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'FOXE3 gene', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'LOX gene', 'LTBP2 gene', 'Link', 'MADH4 gene', 'MYH11 gene', 'MYLK gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Medical', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Sudden Death', 'Surgical Management', 'Syndrome', 'TGFB2 gene', 'TGFBR1 gene', 'TGFBR2 gene', 'Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'family management', 'gene discovery', 'genetic approach', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'premature', 'prevent', 'proband', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'segregation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,653552,0.0032454007345982085
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,9894766,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'progenitor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'stem cells', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,491199,-0.03145501640744959
"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9937764,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2020,550000,0.023758605861321214
"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way. While there has been great progress so far, current methods based on assembling the short reads into transcript annotations have reached a plateau. We propose two innovations that can help overcome the limits. The first is one-step simultaneous analyses of multiple samples in an RNA-seq collection, in contrast with the current two-step approach that analyzes each sample separately and then merges the results. The second is to create and interrogate assembly-free representations of AS. The project will design a suite of tools that will leverage the latent information in large collections of samples and from heterogeneous data types to build complete and accurate AS signatures of tissues and cell types, and to elucidate the regulatory circuitry of AS and its functional implications. Aim 1 will develop a high- performance multi-sample transcript assembly tool, combining subexon graph representations of genes and AS variations, statistical methods for improved feature detection, and search space reduction techniques for efficient sample processing. Aim 2 will build highly efficient and accurate feature selection tools to detect and characterize assembly-free AS variations (subexons and introns), simultaneously from collections of RNA-seq samples. It will combine novel regularized programs with complex models of intronic `noise' and other RNA-seq confounders, and enable analyses of differential splicing and to identify individual and group-specific variations. Lastly, Aim 3 will develop a system to comprehensively model the regulatory and functional circuitry of AS and the effects of mutations, starting from deep learning models of sequences and alignments and integrating expression, sequence, epigenetic and mutation data across tissues, cell types and conditions. We will rigorously test and evaluate all tools in simulations and on large public data sets, as well as on thyroid and head and neck cancer data provided by our collaborators, and we will experimentally validate random subsets of predictions with capillary electrophoresis and qRT-PCR. Collectively, the concepts, methods and tools will establish a new framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that can efficiently tackle the `big data' challenges, leading to more complete discovery and annotation of AS structure and function in human health and disease.   NARRATIVE Alternative splicing is a fundamental gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human physiology and disease. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is making it possible to characterize alternative splicing in great detail, however, current bioinformatics analysis tools miss important variations. The project will design a suite of innovative tools that criss-cross information across multiple RNA-seq samples, and across heterogeneous sequence, epigenetic and expression data, to more comprehensively and more accurately determine the structure, function and regulation of alternative splicing in human biology and disease.",Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data,10021689,R01GM129085,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Bypass', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Charge', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Farming environment', 'Follicular thyroid carcinoma', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Graph', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'International', 'Introns', 'Learning Module', 'Length', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliced Genes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'prototype', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'simulation', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,363164,-0.026535720401625006
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm. Interestingly, I have developed new tools to study the controllers mediating this essential transfer of information. The objective of this work is to discover all the regulators and the ways they interact one with each other to generate a fully-grown organism because it will ultimately help to understand human development and disease.",Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development,10081285,R00HD093873,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Appointment', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fertilization', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Messenger RNA', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Oocytes', 'Organism', 'Play', 'Polyribosomes', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Prothrombin', 'RNA', 'RNA Conformation', 'RNA Helicase', 'RNA Probes', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'career', 'egg', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Stability', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R00,2020,249000,0.01418841357952995
"Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity Project Summary In a well-received preprint, the investigator identified through unbiased analysis of own and published datasets that during aging, and infection of the lung with influenza A, there is a progressive imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. Failure of gene expression homeostasis impacts the rheostatic ability of almost all cellular processes implicated in aging impairing organ function, particularly in response to systemic stress. Transcriptome imbalance could account for manifestations of aging through several potential mechanisms, including: 1) The dysregulation of individual genes, 2) A dysregulation of the stoichiometry of macromolecular complexes, 3) A relative upregulation of short early-response inflammatory genes, 4) A breakdown of the coordination between molecular pathways and processes encoded by genes of different lengths and 5) A reduction in the capacity of protein homeostasis and cell stress responses to respond towards external stimuli by sequestering its activity toward a buffering of transcriptome imbalance. The investigator will test the hypothesis that during aging transcriptome imbalance globally interferes with the functions encoded by the genome and contributes to the loss of resilience in older individuals. To address this fundamental question, he will focus on innovative mammalian ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo models of age-dependent transcriptome imbalance, and machine-learning approaches. Reflecting the interdisciplinary character, he will work under the supervision of his main mentor Dr. Amaral, a network scientist and data- scientist, and his co-mentor Dr. Morimoto, a molecular biologist studying protein homeostasis and aging. Further marking his transition to independence, he will be mentored by Dr. Budinger, an immunologist studying changes in immune aging, and Dr. McNally, a geneticist and bioinformatician, which is not part of a project grant of his mentors. Aim 1 (K99): To determine whether SFPQ regulates transcriptome imbalance in aging. Aim 2 (K99): To determine whether adaptive changes in proteostasis buffer transcriptome imbalance during aging after influenza A pneumonia. Aim 3 (R00): To causally link transcriptome imbalance to the age-related susceptibility to influenza A pneumonia. Importantly, the investigator’s mentoring committee has a very strong track record of training postdoctoral fellows in transitioning into independent investigators. He will engage in seminars and learn recent experimental techniques, grant writing, bioethics training, and training on running a laboratory, and obtain additional off-site training on the biology of aging in mice with the purpose to facilitate collaborations. Combining the new skills learned during his K99 mentored phase with his prior expertise in data science and transcriptomics will ensure a strong technical foundation to launch an independent laboratory on gene expression homeostasis in aging and the mechanisms underlying multi-system dysfunction. Project Narrative The ability to sustain gene expression homeostasis, is one of the most integral parts of cellular biology but declines with age. In a well-received preprint, the project investigator discovered that most organs of 24 months old mice, and lungs infected with influenza A, display a genome-wide imbalance in the transcript levels encoded by short genes relative to those encoded by long genes. This project will address the regulation of this transcriptome imbalance and its impact on the functional health of the proteome and the multi-morbidity in aged individuals.",Integrative Multi-Scale Systems Analysis of Gene-Expression-Driven Aging Morbidity,10040210,K99AG068544,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Bioethics', 'Biology of Aging', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Stress', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Geroscience', 'Global Change', 'Glutamine', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune', 'Immunologist', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung infections', 'Machine Learning', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Polymerase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA metabolism', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'Writing', 'age related', 'aged', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell age', 'genome-wide', 'healthspan', 'immune function', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'influenza A pneumonia', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pneumonia model', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'proteostasis', 'resilience', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'stoichiometry', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,122861,0.016651107349044708
"Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology There is now incontrovertible evidence from sophisticated lineage tracing studies that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) de-differentiation contributes substantively to a number of vascular diseases. A major manifesta- tion of such phenotypic change is attenuated expression of a battery of VSMC-restricted genes, including the enigmatic smooth muscle calponin (Cnn1) gene. The function of Cnn1 has been studied primarily in vitro or in a single knockout mouse wherein several exons and introns were replaced with a neo cassette which, as detailed below, obfuscates accurate interpretation of phenotypes. We have championed the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in mice to engineer subtle substitutions within regulatory elements of many genes, leaving intact all coding sequences. We report here a remarkable phenotype wherein a single base change of a single CArG box in the Cnn1 locus abolishes expression of CNN1 in vascular (but not visceral) SMC. Full expression of CNN1 is restored with a BAC carrying human CNN1 or CRISPR-mediated activation of the en- dogenous Cnn1 promoter. Cnn1 CArG mutant mice, representing the first animal models of regulatory element edits, also show elevation in VSMC DNA synthesis and defective contractile competence. Conversely, over- expression of BAC-CNN1 suppresses VSMC growth, antagonizes neointimal formation, reduces VSMC lipid uptake, and enhances contractile gene expression. Interestingly, CNN1-Ser175 appears to be a critical residue for some of these effects making it an attractive amino acid for CRISPR-mediated editing in mice. Additional data support CNN1 as a scaffold for ERK signaling and effector of the immotile state of differentiated VSMC. Importantly, a complete understanding of CNN1 function is complicated by robust expression of two related genes (Cnn2 and Cnn3) in VSMC. We hypothesize that CNN1 functions in concert with other CNN isoforms to maintain a mature VSMC differentiated state. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims using state-of-the-art tools in genetics, animal models of disease, and molecular physiology assays of VSMC function. Aim 1 will exploit the single base edit in Cnn1 as a novel loss-of-function mouse in context of acute and chronic vascular disease models; complementation studies will be carried out in vitro and in vivo to rigorously ascribe pheno- typic changes to the specific loss of CNN1. Aim 2 will exploit a well-characterized BAC mouse to elucidate functions associated with Cnn1 gain-of-function in models of vascular disease used in Aim 1. Complementary CRISPR editing of the BAC mouse, in background of Cnn1 KO, will afford exquisite insight into functional residues that mediate CNN1 function. Aim 3 will exploit new floxed Cnn2 and Cnn3 mice with an exciting VSMC-specific Cre driver we have developed to address, for the first time, triple Cnn KO mouse models at baseline and in acute or chronic vascular disease models. These studies, based on paradigm-shifting approaches to gene KOs, serve as a template for the study of other gene families linked to VSMC differen- tiation and will inform future studies targeting CNN1 in diseases where VSMC differentiation is compromised. Diseases of blood vessels involve radical changes in the normal program of gene expression and function, the underlying nature of which is poorly understood. We have used the revolutionary CRISPR system of genome editing to study a gene called CNN1, which is specific for smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. We will study this gene, along with related genes, in both cells and blood vessels to gain new insights into vascular diseases.",Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology,10053587,R01HL136224,"['Actins', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Injury', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Cre driver', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Introns', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'LoxP-flanked allele', 'MAPK3 gene', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'base', 'calponin', 'cell growth', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'myocardin', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vascular injury', 'vascular smooth muscle cell migration']",NHLBI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,571166,0.007128867388280321
"Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline Project Summary Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction and delivery across all cell types remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as meganucleases, Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR- Cas9, rely on recruiting the DNA repair machinery, either using error-prone, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for gene knockout, or homology directed repair (HDR) for precise correction. However, HDR is inactive in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, and is often inefficient, achieving 50% correction at most. Genome editing still lacks efficient, robust tools that can insert, delete, and recombine large stretches of DNA sequence. Moreover, delivery tools are a significant barrier to deploying tissue-specific genomic engineering technologies as current vehicles, including widely-used viral vectors and liposomal approaches, have limited capacity, offer variable efficiency, and lack precise tissue tropism. The proposed work involves computationally mining bacteria for new classes of gene editing enzymes and delivery vectors. We know that natural recombinases and transposases can mediate programmed DNA rearrangement and insertion, and these classes of enzymes are present in phage defense and mobile islands in bacteria, which largely remain uncharacterized. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that retroviral/retrotransposon gag-like proteins can self-assemble and encapsulate nucleic acid in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs) for cell-to-cell communication. As with defense islands, these proteins can also be systematically catalogued via a bioinformatic pipeline and experimentally characterized. The proposed work will focus on three main goals: 1) signatures for phage defense, mobile genetic activity, or VLP-forming activity will be mined to build a machine learning pipeline for comprehensively discovering novel gene clusters from novel metagenomic sequences with a focus for proteins that can manipulate nucleic acid or self-assemble, 2) candidate gene clusters will be cloned from metagenomic samples and undergo high-throughput screening using biochemical and bacterial assays for gene editing and capsid formation, as well as engineering to hone activity, and 3) the most promising candidates will be evaluated for activity in mammalian systems with assays for highly efficient gene insertion and VLP formation. The work will elucidate novel bacterial phage defense and VLP biology, and result in the development of new technologies for more efficient genetic manipulation and gene delivery. Moreover, this gene exploration and engineering framework will serve as a model for discovering diverse bacterial gene clusters and defense systems, evaluating biochemical activity across a range of assays, and converting these findings into high impact biotechnologies. The developed technologies will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Project Narrative There are more than 5,000 human diseases caused by known genetic variation, including mutations, insertions, and deletions, but programmable tools and delivery vectors to reliably study and model these diseases are lacking. We propose a two-pronged approach to discovering novel gene editing and delivery strategies by (1) mining bacterial and archaeal systems to identify novel defense systems and enzymes that have activities useful for genome editing and (2) identifying gene clusters linked to extracellular vesicle or viral-like particle formation that will allow development of better gene delivery systems. The technologies developed from this work will accelerate the study and modeling of disease biology and provide a framework for general prokaryotic gene discovery across many biotechnological areas.","Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline",9873379,R21AI149694,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacterial Model', 'Bacteriophages', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Capsid', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Transfer', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Island', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liposomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Mining', 'Mitotic', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stretching', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Transposase', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'cell regeneration', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental adaptation', 'enzyme activity', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene delivery system', 'gene discovery', 'gene repair', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knockout gene', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein profiling', 'recombinase', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'restraint', 'screening', 'technology development', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'vector genome', 'zinc finger nuclease']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,188250,-0.00156059191550053
"Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation Abstract Macrophages in Greek means “big eaters"" are powerful cellular components of innate immunity. They play a pivotal role in immune defense by ‘eating’ pathogens, dead or cancerous cells. They also contribute to tissue homeostasis, development and repair. When doing their job, macrophages react to their surroundings and trigger acute inflammation to resolve the problems. They do so by assuming one of the two states that have been widely recognized, i.e., immunoreactive (proinflammatory) and immunotolerant (a.k.a, M1 and M2, respectively). While finite degrees of reactivity and tolerance are desirable in physiology, excess of either state is undesirable and invariably associated with disease pathogenesis (i.e., the Goldilocks conundrum). For example, hyperreactivity is recognized as the root cause of tissue injury in a wide array of diseases (colitis, sepsis, NASH) and hypertolerance is a common determinant that drives most, if not all chronic diseases that are incurable, e.g., cancers. Consensus on the definition of these physiologic and pathologic macrophage states has not been reached, perhaps because of 4 major challenges: heterogeneity, biological robustness, the temporal evolution of the network, and artifacts (tremendous plasticity of macrophages as they drift rapidly when isolated from tissues). We have used a novel computational methodology, Boolean Implication Network [Sahoo 2008], to analyze pooled human macrophage gene expression datasets. This method, which identifies asymmetric gene expression patterns, blurs noise (heterogeneity/artifacts) but reveals a temporal model of events that is invariably seen across all datasets. The analysis revealed hitherto unknown continuum transition states between reactive to tolerant states along five paths; machine-learning identified one of them as the major path which subsequently stood the rigorous test/validation on multiple publicly available transcriptomic datasets, across species (mouse and human), macrophage subtypes and disease states. Most importantly, unlike other commonly used gene cluster signatures, the Boolean path can prognosticate outcomes across diverse diseases. Preliminary validation studies on a genetic model confirm that the path could be exploited for modulating macrophage polarization by altering LPS/TLR4 responses. We will now interrogate the impact of these discoveries using an iterative approach, i.e., model-driven experimentation and experiment-driven model refinement, through three aims: Unravel the importance of novel molecular drivers in the newly identified gene signatures of macrophage polarization using semi-HTP chemical/genetic screens on murine and human monocyte-derived macrophages (Aim 1), in murine disease models of hyperreactivity and hypertolerance (Aim 2) and in “Humanoids”, i.e., human organoid-based microbe/immune cells co-culture models (“gut-in-a-dish”; Aim 3). Although our focus is gastrointestinal infection and inflammation, the findings will define macrophage transition states in multiple organs/disease contexts and therefore, impact many fields. We expect to identify high-value therapeutic targets that can restrict and/or reset macrophage responses to infections and inflammation within the “Goldilocks zone.” Narrative Macrophages are powerful cellular components of innate immunity; on the one hand they play a pivotal role in defending against pathogens, cancerous cells and other harmful stimuli by being immunoreactive, and on the other hand, they contribute to tissue homeostasis by being immunotolerant to harmless antigens and beneficial microbes. Too much or too little of either of these two states (immunoreactive vs. tolerant) can serve as triggers and perpetuate diverse human diseases. Using novel computational approaches, we have charted a formal model for macrophage response to infections, and revealed hitherto unknown important genes that regulate the process of macrophage polarization; we plan to identify potential therapeutic targets that can reprogram macrophage response in disease states.",Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation,10100201,R01AI155696,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cancerous', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Eating', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Immunity', 'Noise', 'Nomenclature', 'Occupations', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TLR4 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'beneficial microorganism', 'body system', 'bone', 'cell type', 'chemical genetics', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gastrointestinal infection', 'genetic signature', 'human disease', 'human model', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,1000214,0.009058973571273917
"Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to build mathematical models of human innate immune responses to the global pathogen influenza virus A (IAV). To ensure successful replication, viral pathogens must simultaneously hijack several components of the host cell machinery while either evading or disabling innate cellular defenses. The host genetic background and subsequent viral and host signaling interactions dictate disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to mortality. Recent studies of IAV in genetically diverse murine models confirm the critical role of genotype in host response and outcome. Both molecular targets as well as key proteins involved in IAV pathogenesis could be therapeutically exploited to attenuate or prevent disease. Thus, we construct models of the molecular networks driving early innate IAV response that can be used to model genetic effects. Our experimental system is human lung epithelium, the first-line of defense against and target of IAV.  Aim 1. Genetic predictions from the gene regulatory network (GRN) governing human epithelial IAV response. GRNs describe the control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). We showed that integrating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq improves GRN accuracy. To construct a dynamic GRN in our heterogeneous lung tissue model, we propose scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements of IAV infection and IFNβ stimulation time courses. Our group recently discovered new mechanisms by which the IAV protein Ns1 drives promoter-independent transcriptional “read-through” and alters 3D-chromatin architecture. Thus, for modeling, we also measure genomic transcription initiation and promoter-capture Hi-C. Following experimental testing and GRN refinement, we will use a deep-learning model trained on DNA sequence and epigenetic data to provide inputs that enable dynamic GRN simulations for thousands of human genotypes. We will identify genetic risk loci and molecular mechanisms driving difference in gene expression responses across individuals.  Aim 2. Model the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and cellular signaling networks driving the innate immune response to IAV. We developed mutant influenza viruses, each encoding a FLAG-tagged viral protein, while maintaining virulence in vivo. We will use the mutant IAV to map host-virus PPIs in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung in vivo. Integrating with diverse ‘omics datasets, we will construct a molecular network model connecting virus-host PPIs through cellular signaling pathways to IAV-dependent TFs. We will test pathway reconstruction with epistasis mapping.  Completion of both aims will lead to a GRN spanning virus-host PPIs and cellular signaling to TF control of gene expression in an innate-immune cell type. Our experimental-computational design is widely applicable. This model, and its future adaptation to other cells, will help identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving diverse human IAV responses and the network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human response to Influenza virus infection varies dramatically between individuals, from mildly symptomatic to death. We will systematically measure and model the innate immune response to IAV at the molecular network level: from host-virus protein-protein interactions through cellular signal transduction to changes in gene expression in human cells. The resulting mathematical model will help identify network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy and help predict differences in IAV response in the human population.",Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus,9950738,U01AI150748,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza A virus', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon-beta', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Population', 'Prize', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Training', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immune response', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu', 'forest', 'global health', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'mathematical model', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk variant', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF', 'transcription termination', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,1202266,-0.01273812223791035
"Computational Approaches for RNA Structure and Function Determination In collaboration with Shuo Gu we studied the nuanced functionalities of Drosha in cellular systems due to its importance for understanding the processing of microRNAs and how they relate to normal cellular activity as well as diseases such as cancer. Here we studied Drosha targeted stem-loop structures and the types of microRNA isoforms that were produced by these Drosha/RNA interactions. Experimental and computational approaches were applied to determine how the produced isoforms varied as a function of the RNA sequence and structure. Results indicate that bent, distorted and/or flexible structures in the targeted Drosha stem seem to facilitate the production of alternate forms of microRNAs. Structural predictions and experimental results were compared and correlated. Specifically, cleavage of pri-miR-9-1, but not pri-miR-9-2 or pri-miR-9-3, generated an alternative miR-9 with a shifted seed sequence that exapands the scope of its target RNAs. Interestingly, analysis of low-grade glioma patient samples indicate that alternative pri-miR-9 has a potential for tumor progression.Other pri-miRs were also studied and they also produced isoforms as a function of the targeted RNA's shape and flexibility --- In cell SHAPE prediction provides a new level of detail for determining RNA structure within cells. These results may vary from the more standard SHAPE techniques that do not take the cellular environment into account when producing potential structural predictions. We developed a method for the computational prediction of in cell SHAPE by training a neural network (which was optimized by hyper-paramaterization techniques) based on known in cell SHAPE measurements obtained from an E. coli database. Predictions, given a sequence, produce reasonably accurate results with a Pearson coefficient with experimental shape scores better than thermodynamic folding. As an example, we predicted the SHAPE scores around translation start sites in mRNAs. The method indicates that nucleotides immediately upstream of the translation start sites to be relatively unstructured. These results were found to be statistically significant, while in contrast, results based on thermodynamic folding were not. This is the first time that computational methods have been applied to the prediction of RNA structure within cells based on machine learning. ---In another project in collaboration with Mikhail Kashlev we determining motifs that during transcription are responsible for transcriptional termination. These motifs appear to go beyond the standard RNA hairpin that is normally involved in termination. The approach involves the use of MPGAFOLD, a massively parallel genetic algorithm the includes capabilities to predict RNA secondary structures that form during transcription, i.e. co-transcriptional folding as the RNA strand elongates. As it does local structures form. These structures in turn have the ability to form tertiary interactions which can influence the formation of termination motifs. These sequential secondary structure motifs are also modeled in 3D further verifying their potential formation and tertiary influence. A new paradigm for termination control may be indicated by these results.---Another project in collaboration with Stuart Le Grice involves the development of a computational approach to determined binding sites and affinities of small molecules targeting various RNA structural motifs. The goal of this project is to aid in the screening of small molecules for their potential to be therapeutically beneficial in targeting viral RNAs or cancer causing genes. The small molecules are initially derived from sets found by binding to experimental screening methods using small molecule microarrays. The pipeline as it currently stands is able to determine to a reasonable level of accuracy ligand poses as well as the conformation of the binding pockets. It also seem able to discriminate between different levels of binding affinities for different ligands. The pipe-line is currently being applied to the epsilon region of the hepatitis delta virus and to the triple stranded PAN. We are able to get good agreement with NMR and X-ray structure data respectively to these two significantly different sites. This methodology is opening the door to computational prediction of small molecule binding the RNA motifs for potential therapeutics purposes, a domain of research that has not been extensively explored.---In collaboration with Anne Simon, University of Maryland a new RNA structure drawing algorithm was developed, RNA2Drawer. RNA structure prediction programs remain imperfect and many substructures are still identified by manual exploration, which is most efficiently conducted within an RNA structure drawing program. RNA2Drawer was developed to allow for graphical structure editing while maintaining the geometry of a drawing (e.g., ellipsoid loops, stems with evenly stacked base pairs) throughout structural changes and manual adjustments to the layout by the user. In addition, the program allows for annotations such as colouring and circling of bases and drawing of tertiary interactions (e.g., pseudoknots). RNA2Drawer can also draw commonly desired elements such as an optionally flattened outermost loop and assists structure editing by automatically highlighting complementary subsequences, which facilitates the discovery of potentially new and alternative pairings, particularly tertiary pairings over long-distances, which are biologically critical in the genomes of many RNA viruses. RNA2Drawer outputs drawings either as PNG files, or as PPTX and SVG files, such that every object of a drawing (e.g., bases, bonds) is an individual PPTX or SVG object, allowing for further manipulation in Microsoft PowerPoint or a vector graphics editor such as Adobe Illustrator. --Also in collaboration with Anne Simon, University of Maryland, we have been exploring the RNA motifs that are involved in alternative modes of translation in eukaryotic systems. Specifically we have been concentrating on those that do not contain 5' cap sites and lack a poly A tail, cap Independent translation elements (CITE, or PTE), which is not the normal mode of translation, but is a mechanism found in several RNA viruses. We have found elements, via computational 3D modeling and experimental verification such as site directed mutagenesis and SHAPE, that seem to be common for example, in Carmoviruses that stabilize structures beyond pseudoknot motifs that are conducive for translation factor binding and thus mimic 5' cap sites. n/a",Computational Approaches for RNA Structure and Function Determination,10262024,ZIABC008382,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affinity', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carmovirus', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hepatitis Delta Virus', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Poly(A) Tail', 'Production', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Viruses', 'RNA analysis', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Cancer', 'Virus', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'neural network', 'programs', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'structured data', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'transcription termination', 'translation factor', 'tumor progression', 'vector', 'viral RNA', 'web site']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2020,460420,0.009836648241310768
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9938688,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,480000,0.031156755419136112
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9987332,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'structured data', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2020,585552,0.04096028814147634
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9817679,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2020,229500,0.008811160300581291
"Comparative genomic analysis of bacteria species In the past decade, the amount of microbiome data has grown considerably. These enormous datasets present new challenges and opportunities to understand, and even manipulate, the human microbiome for human health. One of the key challenges is that while metagenomic sequence data can be used to identify correlations between microbiome composition and disease states, they should be analyzed in conjunction with microbiology experiments to reveal the underlying mechanism for the causal relationship. However, microbiologists have generally focused on model species or a few pathogens when they study a function. Therefore, many functions are known in only one or a few species. In this project, we used straightforward comparative genomics to identify these functions across a broad range of species of the gut microbiome.  We focused on disease-relevant functions in gut bacteria. We have identified a list of features including presence of certain genes and operons or pathways for investigation. We curated a database of human gut metagenomes by manually examining phenotype information and associated all possible related metadata to the metagenomic sequence data. We also identified a comprehensive collection of gut microbial reference genomes. These resources gathered are the fundamental material for the project.  We developed a tool named GutFunFind, a pipeline wrapped in python to infer the functional capability of a species based on detecting related genes/gene clusters in the genome. GutFunFind allows for customized query databases and tailored detection methods to identify orthologs of characterized genes in a given genome. Currently, GutFunFind supports detection methods including blast, Hmmer, interproscan. We are working on integrating more methods such as HHpred, protein structure prediction, and machining learning-based classifiers to the detection module of GutFunFind. The current version of GutFunFind reports genes in the same neighborhood to assist manual curation. We have implemented GutFunFind to identify several disease-relevant functions including histamine production, mucic and saccharic acid metabolism, and cysteine degradation. We are in the process of reporting these results for publications.  Taking advantage of the curated metagenomic dataset and the bacteria genomes, we worked with Dr. Hall (University of Maryland) to computationally predict novel gene function in gut bacteria. We identified genes of interest by comparative analysis of metagenomic samples with differential metabolite abundance. We further characterized the putative function by additional analysis including searching for protein domains, phylogeny-based clustering, taxonomy association and structural modeling. The computational predicted function will be experimentally validated by Dr. Hall.   In collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Gisela Storz (NICHD/DIR), we identified and characterized rpn, a gene that encodes both toxin protein and an in-frame C-terminal antitoxin protein. We performed comprehensive analysis of the phylogenies of the gene and showed that rpn is highly mobile and prevalent across both bacteria and archaea. We also observed that the generation of a second copy of the C-terminal small protein antitoxin downstream of the parent gene occurred independently multiple times during evolution. This finding not only described a new type of toxin-antitoxin system but also provided an evolutionary model explaining the origin of toxin-antitoxin system. n/a",Comparative genomic analysis of bacteria species,10268082,ZIALM202010,"['Acids', 'Archaea', 'Bacteria', 'C-terminal', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Custom', 'Cysteine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Gene Cluster', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Histamine Production', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neighborhoods', 'Operon', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Universities', 'Work', 'antitoxin', 'base', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'database query', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiome', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein structure prediction', 'reference genome', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2020,619689,-0.025402830689401995
"Hematopoietic Stem Cell And Cord Blood Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors, haploidentical related donors and cord blood units can cure life-threatening blood disorders; however, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and survivorship disparities across different ancestries remain the major obstacles. When matched donors are not available, the properties of HLA mismatches that govern (non)-permissivity are not well-defined. Furthermore, the role of KIR/HLA interactions in modulating relapse remain to be clarified. These deficiencies have important implications for a large fraction of patients who lack HLA-matched donors, and for all patients at risk for disease relapse. We have demonstrated that HLA class I leader peptides, HLA-DP expression, and HLA/KIR interactions each contribute to GVHD, relapse and mortality. The unmet needs are to understand the mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes modulate transplant risks, and a means to apply the research findings to clinical care. We propose to define the underlying mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes and proteins function in transplantation, and develop tools for using HLA and KIR in the selection of the optimal transplant donor and cord blood unit. The specific aims are to: define the role of HLA-DP expression and peptide-binding groove pocket in GVHD; define NKG2/HLA-E interactions and HLA-G in GVHD and relapse; define the role for KIR and HLA interaction in relapse after HCT for acute leukemia, and design tools to evaluate gene features in clinical practice. The goals will be achieved through systemic analysis of individual gene variation, haplotypes of genes, and receptor/ligand recognition in large ethnically diverse transplant populations with complete clinical data.

"Hematopoietic Stem Cell And Cord Blood Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors, haploidentical related donors and cord blood units can cure life-threatening blood disorders; however, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and survivorship disparities across different ancestries remain the major obstacles. When matched donors are not available, the properties of HLA mismatches that govern (non)-permissivity are not well-defined. Furthermore, the role of KIR/HLA interactions in modulating relapse remain to be clarified. These deficiencies have important implications for a large fraction of patients who lack HLA-matched donors, and for all patients at risk for disease relapse. We have demonstrated that HLA class I leader peptides, HLA-DP expression, and HLA/KIR interactions each contribute to GVHD, relapse and mortality. The unmet needs are to understand the mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes modulate transplant risks, and a means to apply the research findings to clinical care. We propose to define the underlying mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes and proteins function in transplantation, and develop tools for using HLA and KIR in the selection of the optimal transplant donor and cord blood unit. The specific aims are to: define the role of HLA-DP expression and peptide-binding groove pocket in GVHD; define NKG2/HLA-E interactions and HLA-G in GVHD and relapse; define the role for KIR and HLA interaction in relapse after HCT for acute leukemia, and design tools to evaluate gene features in clinical practice. The goals will be achieved through systemic analysis of individual gene variation, haplotypes of genes, and receptor/ligand recognition in large ethnically diverse transplant populations with complete clinical data. This proposal will fill the knowledge gap in the immunobiological basis of GVHD, relapse and survivorship disparities in transplantation. The information will increase the safety, efficacy and availability of transplantation for all patients in need of this life-saving therapy.

"Development of methods for transcript quantification and differential expression analysis using long-read sequencing technologies. The rapid development of Third Generation, Long Read Sequencing (LRS) platforms such as Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have enabled increasing precision and higher-throughput sequencing of transcripts. Long reads can produce full-length transcript sequences, overcoming much of the uncertainty of short-read methods to accurately define transcripts, particularity for those genes with alternative splicing (more than 90% of human genes), for which short read sequencing has thus far proved difficult. LRS is therefore the natural choice for the study of the expression of transcript variants and of the role of alternative isoforms in disease and development. While the first iterations of the long-read technologies did not produce enough reads to quantify more than the highest expressed transcripts, the current sequencing depth of up to 8 million reads per SMRT cells on the Sequel 2 platforms promises reliable quantifiability for more modestly expressed genes. Also significant yield increases have been reported for Nanopore. This suggests that LRS may have reached sufficient throughput to enable accurate quantification of gene expression and differential expression analyses. LRS transcriptomics data have, however, specific properties that are absent in other transcriptomics technologies, such are partial matches of reference transcript models. Therefore specific methods for quantification and statistical analysis need to be developed. In this Project, we aim to characterize in detail the data distribution in long reads data, propose strategies to deal with their particular read uncertainty issues and develop new strategies for differential expression analysis. The overarching goal is to create the analytical framework to fully leverage LRS technologies for the study of isoform dynamics in relation of biomedical relevant questions. The goal of this project is to develop the SQANTI-QDE software, the first integral framework for the management of long read sequencing Iso-seq experiments. SQANTI-QDE will provide, in one tool, functionalities for the annotation and processing of multiple samples, improved definition of bona-fide transcripts, quantification of transcript expression, flexible creation of count matrices, data normalization, and differential expression and isoform usage analysis. Highly replicated, deep sequenced long read sequencing transcriptomics datasets will be created as part of this project.",Development of methods for transcript quantification and differential expression analysis using long-read sequencing technologies.,10041221,R21HG011280,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Ataxia', 'Awareness', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Heart', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Linear Models', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Orphan', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polyadenylation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'method development', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'preservation', 'sequencing platform', 'software development', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,405007,0.01818618121318399
"RNA dynamics and co-translational decay in aging and aging-related disease While genomes encapsulate the information for the development and function of cells most of the biological complexity lies on high-order interactions that manifest at the DNA, RNA and protein level. The understanding of these multifaceted regulatory mechanisms is of paramount importance for the understanding of complex, polygenic processes such as ageing.  In previous works we described a co-translational pathway of mRNA decay that is mediated by ribosome-phased cleavage of the mRNA (Ibrahim et al., 2018). We developed a new protocol, Akron-Seq, and integrated orthogonal large-scale genomic datasets to identify that the process is initiated by a ribosome stall that triggers an endonucleolytic cleavage and results in propagating cleavages by upstream ribosomes. Published protocols such as 5P-Seq or Akron-Seq are able to capture native mRNA ends but not both ends on the same molecule, therefore limiting our ability to probe mRNA properties and molecular pathways that affect both ends of the mRNA molecules. Our group is developing and using new, combined experimental/computational approaches to capture the native ends of mRNA molecules in cells and tissues to profile RNA in unprecedented detail.  We have initially successfully applied these techniques involving long-read sequencing in HeLa cells to establish and optimize the protocols. We have also developed new computational tools for the analysis of the novel datasets. One of our computational tools (SamQL) has been packaged and offered as an open-source library and executable program for intuitive and complex queries on high-throughput data stored in SAM/BAM files. By analyzing our novel long-read sequencing data and integrating orthogonal CLIP-Seq datasets we have discovered a group of RNA-binding proteins that are potentially associated with the control of co-translational RNA decay and that have been implicated with cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Similar to our previous work, where we identify the effect of an ALS-associated mutation in gene translation and mitochondria morphology (Nakaya and Maragkakis, 2018), we are following up on these discoveries to dissect the molecular mechanisms guided by the identified proteins. Additionally, we are analyzing, computationally, large-scale transcriptomic data from studies such as the GESTALT to discover age-associated changes in RNA dynamics and the ratio between RNA transcription and decay. Moreover, we have initiated a pilot analysis of the transcriptomic profile of aging APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Finally, by using long-read transcriptome sequencing we have found that the retention of intron 2 in CD19 contributes to CART-19 resistance in leukemias with CD19 subclonal frameshift mutations (Asnani et al., 2020). n/a",RNA dynamics and co-translational decay in aging and aging-related disease,10252559,ZIAAG000696,"['APP-PS1', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'CD19 gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hela Cells', 'Homeostasis', 'Introns', 'Intuition', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Presenile Alzheimer Dementia', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Decay', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomes', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translations', 'Work', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human RNA sequencing', 'leukemia', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,ZIA,2020,1684788,0.008121487762642461
"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,9873543,R01AR045192,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Future', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Ichthyoses', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-in', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'design', 'gene induction', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'keratinocyte differentiation', 'neural network algorithm', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'skin barrier', 'skin disorder', 'skin squamous cell carcinoma', 'transcription factor', 'tumor progression']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,504604,-0.027567282723395158

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9995511,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,302789,-0.022772469410671833
"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,9912024,F31HG010999,"['Address', 'Adenosine', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acids', 'Atlases', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breast', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enzymes', 'Exons', 'Functional disorder', 'Guanosine', 'Human', 'Inosine', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurons', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Poly(A) Tail', 'Polyadenylation', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'career', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional outcomes', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'machine learning method', 'nanopore', 'neuron loss', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2020,38613,0.014394719344826116
"Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches Aortic valve stenosis is the major cause of valve disease in the Western world, and the third leading cause of adult heart disease. It is a progressive disorder that worsens with age. Thickening of the aortic valve is followed by calcification that results in further stenosis that ultimately necessitates surgical replacement. A major risk factor for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which is present in 1–2% of the population, and involves formation of a two- rather than three-valve leaflet. ~35% of individuals with BAV will develop CAVD with age, but some with BAV have thickening even in childhood, requiring intervention. There are no medical treatments available for CAVD patients, and the only clinical option is surgical valve replacement. We reported that heterozygous nonsense mutations in the NOTCH1 (N1) transcription factor cause congenital biscuspid aortic valve (BAV) and severe CAVD and evidence suggests N1 is haploinsufficient in valve endothelial cells (ECs). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs from several patients with CAVD and N1 haploinsufficiency showed increased expression of pro-osteogenic and inflammatory signaling. Network analysis revealed key nodes that were responsible for much of the gene dysregulation. A chemical screen for the ability to restore expression of 120 dysregulated genes by targeted RNA-sequencing revealed several drugs that restored the network close to the N1+/+ state in human iPSC-ECs, with one, XCT790, showing efficacy in vivo for aortic valve thickening, calcification and stenosis in a mouse model. XCT790 is annotated to function as an inhibitor of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα). We now propose to test the hypotheses that XCT790 prevents aortic valve disease by inhibiting ERRα activity, can treat established disease, and can function in a subset of CAVD patient cells without N1 mutations. The aims are 1) to determine the mechanism of action by which XCT790 corrects disease-associated gene expression and prevents aortic valve disease; 2) to determine if XCT790 can treat established CAVD or prevent neonatal valve stenosis; and 3) to determine if gene dysregulation in primary aortic valve endothelial cells from sporadic CAVD patients with or without genetic variants in NOTCH1 pathway genes is responsive to XCT790. These studies will advance a potential therapeutic to treat a disease that represents an enormous unmet medical need, is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, and for which the only current remedy is a highly invasive surgery. Aortic valve disease is the third most common form of heart disease and one of the most difficult to treat pediatric diseases. In adults, calcification and thickening lead to need for surgical replacement, with no medical therapy available. In this proposal we test the mechanism by which a novel small molecule therapeutic prevents aortic valve calcification in mice, test the clinical scenarios in which it may be efficacious and determine the range of patients who may benefit from this therapy by examining the response of cells derived from individuals with valve disease.",Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,9867301,R01HL150100,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'ERR1 protein', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NOTCH1 gene', 'Neonatal', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Valve Stenosis', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Surgical Valves', 'Telomerase RNA Component', 'Telomere Shortening', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Western World', 'aging population', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'calcification', 'cell type', 'drug testing', 'endothelial stem cell ', 'exome sequencing', 'gene correction', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'malformation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'osteogenic', 'prevent', 'response', 'shear stress', 'small molecule libraries', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'telomere', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,J.

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Predictable control of gene regulation through epigenetic engineering PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Recent landmark discoveries have revealed that in addition to DNA lesions, epigenetic mechanisms also play a major role in cancer. Epigenetics is mediated in part by interactions of proteins and DNA that confer heritable gene expression states. Drugging the cancer epigenome is a burgeoning medical technology that currently uses small molecule inhibitors and small RNAs to disrupt hyperactive epigenetic enzymes. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that a new modality, fusion proteins that interact with the chromatin fiber, will activate therapeutic genes at sites that bear a specific pattern of cancer-related biochemical marks. The specific aims are to (2) use bioinformatic analyses to discover chromosome features that support inducible changes in gene expression states and (2) to use protein engineering to identify determinants of nuclear protein engagement.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods to reactivate dormant therapeutic genes in cancer cells are limited to inhibitors that bind epigenetic enzymes and other proteins.

"Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals ABSTRACT While multidrug-resistance transporters including P-gp and MRP2 are generally studied for their role in exporting drugs and foreign compounds from the cell, our studies indicate that these efflux pumps expressed at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells provide a critical link in communication between sentinel functions of mucosal barriers and the immune system. Understanding how this P-gp/eCB anti-inflammatory arm is regulated will provide crucial insight into how dysfunction may promote intestinal inflammation and help identify potential new therapeutic targets. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the central hypothesis we aim to test is whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to prevent unnecessary inflammation. Our pilot studies indicate that the microbiota does influence P-gp expression and function, providing a unique foundation for further cause-effect studies. No data have previously demonstrated a link between the microbiota and eCBs or any other epithelial lipid signals, and may well provide great insight into a novel system. Bridging this gap could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To begin addressing these questions, in Aim 1 of this application will combine in vitro (including human colonoids) and in vivo murine model systems, as well as use healthy and UC patient stool, to more deeply understand the microbial consortia that collectively maximize P-gp expression and function. Aim 2 is designed to identify the microbial metabolites that drive activation of P-gp expression and eCB secretion to maintain an anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses will be performed to provide new information regarding microbial genes, gene clusters, and their metabolic products implicated in maintaining an anti- inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium through regulation of the P-gp/eCB axis. In Aim 3 we will employ novel computational methods will to uncover the inter-microbial network responses and the ecological structure of a stable community that is able to induce P-gp expression. Collectively, knowledge of the pathways that coordinate the maintenance of the P-gp/eCB axis will require a comprehensive understanding of distinct signals regulating intestinal homeostasis, how multiple signals are integrated in the complex intestinal environment, and pathways that modulate host-microbe interactions. Consequently, this proposal will directly advance novel biological principles with guidance of new therapeutic intervention strategies. Public Health Narrative Regulated recruitment and migration of acute inflammatory cells termed neutrophils (PMN) into the intestine and across the specialized epithelium that lines it is critical for host defense, yet dysregulation of this process is associated with disease. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the goal of this proposal will examine whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to maintain a homeostatic anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Understanding this process could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals,10029718,R01DK125407,"['ABCB1 gene', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Apical', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Colitis', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethanolamines', 'Eubacterium', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Knowledge', 'Lactobacillus', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'P-Glycoprotein', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Submucosa', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Work', 'Xenobiotic Metabolism', 'arm', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'commensal bacteria', 'design', 'efflux pump', 'first responder', 'healing', 'host colonization', 'host-microbe interactions', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innate immune mechanisms', 'insight', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal homeostasis', 'mathematical model', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'normal microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'nuclear factor 1', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'theories', 'transcriptomics']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,560048,0.002014171432355481
"Drosophila Functional Genomics Genome sequences contain the information needed for the development and function of a given species.  Exploring conservation of DNA sequence between species is a tool for identifying critical code that is likely to be important for functions shared between species.  Genomic information is deployed by transcription and differential expression may well be important for phenotypic distinctions among closely related species.  Comparative transcription has not been extensively explored. We are working on a genus-wide expression atlas of adult tissues and much of the raw data for this project have been deposited at GEO and the SRA for public consumption.  We have also begun a project to capture and reprocess all Drosophila data from public repositories world-wide, as well as defining the expression range for genes within a species.  These are valuable resources for our work and for the community in general.  How gene interact in networks is an important underpinning for understanding development, physiology, and disease.  We are looking at the transcriptional response to altered gene dose in aneuploid tissue culture cells, during X chromosome dosage compensation, and in a series of flies heterozygous for a tiling path of deletions (DrosDel).  We are mapping the coherent propagation of dosage effects elsewhere in the genome, and using the data to machine-learn network models to explain the observed patterns of gene expression.  We have developed several new approaches to network learning and we are beginning to test predictions with additional expression profiles following directed perturbation by RNAi.  We continue to pilot the use of small compounds and FDA approved drugs, RNAi reagents, Crispr, and genetic background, as tools to perturb gene expression networks. These data are providing important validation of connectivity maps and will allow us to add directionality to network edges, as well as help us understand how different individuals respond to common internal and/or external challenges.  DMRT transcription factors direct gonadal development in essentially all animals, but little is known about the gene networks they regulate. We are working on the function of the Drosophila DMRT (DSX) and are particularly interested in the identification of functional DSX transcription factor target genes.  We have previously used ChIP-Seq and DamID-Seq to determine the in vivo occupancy of DSX using tagged and native proteins in tissue culture cells and in Drosophila tissues and examined expression profiles in wild type and mutant conditions (especially those where we change the isoform of Dsx being expressed and measure the response over time) by RNA-Seq.  We are also performing knockdown experiments to test for the function of candidate DSX targets using RNAi (UAS-shRNAs driven by Dsx-Gal4 and other Gal4 lines).  We continue to work on selected potential DSX targets for detailed phenotypic follow-up to determine the function of these genes in the cells that are in direct contact with the germ line cells in the female and male gonads.   We have initiated new work on understanding the autonomous and non-autonomous effects (including non-autonomous blocked differentiation and/or stem cell tumors) of switching cell identity in gonads from testis to ovary and the reciprocal in specific cell types identified using single cell expression profiling. We have also begun a project to identify host factors involved in corona virus infection and induced cell death. n/a",Drosophila Functional Genomics,10248118,ZIADK015600,"['Adult', 'Aging', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Coronavirus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Dose', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Expression Profiling', 'FDA approved', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ Cells', 'Gonadal structure', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Ovary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Testis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Stem Cells', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'differential expression', 'dosage', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic information', 'genome-wide', 'gonad development', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'learning network', 'literacy', 'male', 'mutant', 'network models', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'public repository', 'response', 'small hairpin RNA', 'sperm cell', 'stem cell model', 'success', 'tissue/cell culture', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,ZIA,2020,1445968,-0.010015861849722491
"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology. Results have the potential to lead to novel targeted therapy for atherosclerosis.",Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis,10004164,R01HL148109,"['Alanine', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Iowa', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Null Lymphocytes', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Threonine', 'Translating', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'calcification', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary plaque', 'dimer', 'genome editing', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oxidized low density lipoprotein', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,671017,0.0015084334350978805
"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10010298,R43NS117234,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dominant Genetic Conditions', 'Drug Screening', 'ELK1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Luciferases', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modification', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Obese Mice', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Regimen', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'Supravalvular aortic stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcend', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Williams Syndrome', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'gene expression database', 'gene therapy', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Expression', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'phase 2 testing', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,"INFIXION BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2020,299503,0.0012063181758102729
