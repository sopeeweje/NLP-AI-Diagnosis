"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,9583421,K99DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,K99,2019,92213,0.03667085759548141
"Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk ABSTRACT Whereas the majority of smokers will quit in any given year, the majority of quit attempts result in relapse. One reason interventions may fail is that they teach smokers strategies for coping with craving in response to environmental triggers, but do not provide smokers with just-in-time information about their risk of smoking lapse. Such risk information could be used to alert smokers to engage in relevant coping strategies including avoidance or use of quick acting pharmacotherapies (e.g. nicotine inhaler). The overarching premise of the proposed research is that prediction of lapse risk can be enhanced by using computer vision to analyze images of everyday life. Recent findings by our team suggest that environments associated with lapse risk can be detected in real-time by coupling deep learning-based object detection with an appropriate classification model. In preliminary research, images taken by smokers of smoking and nonsmoking environments (80 subjects, 2870 images) were used to train such a model, resulting in 77.5% accuracy (0.826 AUC) distinguishing these environments on a separate test set (16 subjects, 516 images). Encouraged by this preliminary finding, we propose to refine and scale up this system by a) creating a larger and more representative image database that includes a sample of everyday environments acquired from smokers (n=60) and b) testing novel, personalized approaches for increasing smoking environment classification accuracy and assessing smoking risk across three aims. In Aim 1, we will improve smoking environment classification accuracy and prediction of smoking risk by re-training an existing deep learning model to recognize a broad set of smoking-related objects (e.g. packs of cigarettes/ashtrays). In Aim 2, we will further improve performance by fitting personalized models that account for individual differences in preferred or typical smoking environments. In Exploratory Aim 3, we will predict craving and negative affect/stress using a similar approach. The proposed research represents an innovative and critical next step in the development of a system that identifies smoking risk and/or its antecedents in real-time to support a just-in-time adaptive intervention for smoking cessation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of smokers relapse within one month of quitting smoking. Environments (e.g. park) and their related objects (e.g. park bench) are associated with smoking and urges to smoke and can serve as triggers to lapse and relapse. The proposed research will use state-of-the-art computer vision and object detection to identify smoking risk environments and objects with the goal of eventually developing systems that alert smokers to such risks from everyday images acquired with cameras worn by smokers. Such a system can be incorporated into more comprehensive and effective smoking cessation programs.",Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk,9774018,R21DA047131,"['Adult', 'Behavior', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nicotine Inhaler', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Shelter facility', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'coping', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'negative affect', 'non-smoking', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'time use']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,201250,0.01725620255917209
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9688867,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,416786,0.041920915537251524
"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,9835007,F31MH121039,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sweden', 'Techniques', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'World Health Organization', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational pipeline']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2019,45016,-0.009568285859526342
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9613247,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2019,165108,0.029131218524017972
"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9696008,R01MH111916,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breeding', 'Callithrix', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'feeding', 'gaze', 'human disease', 'human model', 'learning strategy', 'limb movement', 'microphone', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'speech processing', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'vibration', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,521954,-0.020709324803463897
"Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Advances in health care have been dramatic since the beginning of the millennium. As a result, people are living longer with age-related diseases, and the number of older individuals unable to live independently is rising rapidly. Mobile computing offers an unprecedented opportunity to unobtrusively monitor behavior and use the large amount of collected data to automate analysis of functional health in a person's everyday settings. This project focuses on evaluating the performance and commercial viability of technologies that will meet some of the needs that this coming age wave introduces by automating assessment of a person's functional performance. The primary objective of this Phase I STTR application is to evaluate the feasibility of assessing an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health using behavior patterns as sensed by a smart watch. Achieving this objective will provide a foundation for the Phase II application goal of using multiple information sources to automatically-generate activity scores and functional health measures from sensor data. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach creates a profile of a person's routine behavior through automated real-time recognition of complex activities from mobile sensor data (Aim 1). We will evaluate the use of machine learning techniques to map behavior features onto cognitive and mobility health scores provided through app and in-person neuropsychological assessment (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate an interactive visual tool for displaying behavior patterns to provide individuals and their caregivers with insights on their routines and relationship with their health status (Aim 3). This work has important health care implications as functional impairment has been associated with negative outcomes including increased health care utilization, falls, and conversion to dementia. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, it is imperative to commercialize technologies that increase functional independence while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to evaluate the performance and commercial viability of an application that can predict an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health based on patterns that are sensed by a smart watch, and effectively and efficiently present this information to the caregiver. This work will lay the foundation for a commercial tool to analyze behavior routines and automate assessment of functional health. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden, and improve quality of life.",Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities,9842127,R41EB029774,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Commercial Sectors', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'care costs', 'commercialization', 'commercially viable technology', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'family support', 'functional disability', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized care', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIBIB,"ADAPTELLIGENCE, LLC",R41,2019,347739,-0.03147190093824455
"Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome There is an essential gap in understanding the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior of adults with Down syndrome (DS): objective assessment of these behaviors with accelerometers has not been developed for this population. If this gap remains unfilled, it may impede efforts to objectively quantify the problem of inactivity in adults with DS and to develop effective interventions for improving physical activity and reducing health disparities in this population. Objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior for adults with DS will advance by considering their pathologically low aerobic fitness. It may also improve by applying to accelerometer output innovative machine-learning modes. The long-term goals of the present applicants are to understand the determinants of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS and develop effective interventions for improving their physical activity and health. The objective of this application, in pursuit of the long-term goals, is to calibrate accelerometer output for measuring physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with DS. The central hypothesis is that machine learning applied to accelerometer output will permit accurate prediction of physical activity type and intensity in adults with DS. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data and previous work that has successfully developed machine learning models for individuals without disabilities. The rationale for the proposed research is that accurate measurement of physical activity and sedentariness will lead to better monitoring of these behaviors in adults with DS and to more precise quantification of the effects of interventions for improving their health. Guided by the applicants’ preliminary data and previous work, and a critical review of the empirical knowledge-base, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) compare the relationship between accelerometer output and energy expenditure across various physical activities and sedentary behaviors between adults with and without DS; and (2) develop machine learning models from accelerometer output and evaluate their accuracy for predicting physical activity type and energy expenditure in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 1, output from hip- and wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers and energy expenditure expressed relative to aerobic fitness will be measured during physical activities and sedentary behaviors in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 2, machine learning models for predicting physical activity type and intensity will be developed in samples of adults with and without DS, and their prediction accuracy will be tested in two additional samples. The approach is innovative, because: (a) it will calibrate accelerometer output while accounting for aerobic fitness; (b) it will refine calibration by utilizing machine learning models. The proposed research is significant because it will allow researchers and public health agencies to more precisely monitor the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS. Such knowledge is critical for the development of interventions for improving physical activity, health, and quality of life in adults with DS. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing valid objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with Down syndrome is an essential step towards designing effective interventions for improving physical activity, fitness, health, and quality of life in these persons.

"Application of Machine Vision to Determine the Influence of Sleep States and Social Interactions on Vulnerability to Drug Addiction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this project is to develop a technology that will allow addiction researchers to measure the influence of social and sleep behaviors on drug intake behavior in large-scale genomic experiments to discover genes that regulate vulnerability to addiction. To accomplish this we will develop and make publicly available a highly innovative technology that, for the first time, will allow researchers to continuously monitor complex sleep and social behaviors in groups of mice, using low-cost and easily scaled video equipment. While drug-addiction behaviors have well-established bidirectional relationships with these behaviors, the genetic etiologies have not been fully elucidated. This critical gap is primarily due to technological barriers that prevent reliable phenotyping of large numbers of animals for specific sleep states and social behaviors. Currently available methods for assessing different sleep states are designed to be used with isolated animals and do not measure multiple individuals in a group. Although social context is known to be an influence on addiction vulnerability, it has been largely studied by changing the housing environment and testing isolated animals. We will exploit techniques of artificial intelligence to develop a neural network-based machine-vision method of video analysis of these behaviors, designed to be used in an ethologically-relevant group setting, over long periods of time. This non-invasive method will be a significant advance in behavioral phenotyping, fulfilling the demands of the high-throughput genetic studies necessary for optimizing the mouse as model of addiction. Our first specific aim is to develop a machine-vision method to measure rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, nonREM (NREM) sleep and waking behaviors of all individuals, for use in either single or group housed conditions. We will train and validate our machine-vision networks using EEG and EMG recordings. To demonstrate the utility and assess the performance of our method we will compare two different mouse lines (the control mouse C57Bl/6J and a genetically altered strain, B6.129P2-Nos2 tm1Lau/J) that are known to differ in these sleep parameters. We will compare the sleep of these two mouse strains in both group and single housing. Our second specific aim is to extend our method to enable assessment of group social dynamics and to record all social and active behaviors over multiple days. This will allow us to test the bidirectional effects of social and sleep behaviors with the consumption of self-administered methamphetamine. We will assess the effect of initial social status and sleep quality on drug consumption and also measure how the social interactions and sleep patterns are changed after the drug is available. Successful completion of these aims will yield a validated technology with the capacity to provide detailed measurements of sleep and social behaviors in mice for use in large scale genetic studies, thereby significantly enhancing researchers' ability to identify genes associated with addiction susceptibility. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Despite the urgency to find better treatments for substance abuse disorders, it has been difficult to map the complex interactions between factors contributing to the differences among individuals in vulnerability to addiction. A key issue underlying this knowledge gap is the lack of a technology that can be used to analyze the behaviors of mice—which are the preeminent animal model of addiction—in groups and over long periods of time in experiments testing responses to drug consumption. In the proposed project we will develop and make publicly available an innovative, non-invasive technology incorporating advanced computational and image- analysis approaches that will enable assessment of detailed behavioral activities of genetically diverse, group- housed mice in long-term addiction-susceptibility experiments, laying the groundwork for future studies to identify genes underlying differences among individuals in susceptibility.",Application of Machine Vision to Determine the Influence of Sleep States and Social Interactions on Vulnerability to Drug Addiction,9766801,R21DA048634,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Heritability', 'House mice', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Implant', 'Inbred C57BL Mice', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methamphetamine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polysomnography', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'REM Sleep', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Self Administration', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'limb movement', 'machine vision', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neural network', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid eye movement', 'response', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'social', 'social group', 'substance abuse treatment', 'tool']",NIDA,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2019,255000,-0.020656940964958084
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9701324,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,613809,-0.023837070748483843
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,9796542,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Comorbidity', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,488645,0.00796708612167888
"Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Unhealthy eating increases the risk of developing several kinds of cancer. This occurs directly through consumption of carcinogenic food, and indirectly through overweight and obesity. Because nearly 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, it is critical to develop effective interventions to alter eating behavior. One key factor that influences eating behavior and weight gain is cue-induced food craving. Craving stimulates appetitive motivation to eat, but can be regulated via cognitive strategies such as reappraisal, or the reconstrual of a stimulus to change its affective meaning. Reappraisal increases the salience of consumption- related costs and reduces food craving for unhealthy food. Craving reappraisal is therefore a promising target for interventions designed to reduce unhealthy eating and risk for diet-related cancers. However, individual differences in treatment efficacy remain a persistent problem with interventions. To understand why an intervention works for some individuals and not for others requires clearly defined neurobiological mechanisms of change, as well as sensitive and specific tools to evaluate individual differences in psychological targets. To fill this gap, the goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and multivariate neuroimaging methods to develop and validate a sensitive and specific neural signature of craving reappraisal that can be used as a neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability. To achieve this goal, this project will pursue the following Aims: 1) develop and validate a neural signature of craving reappraisal in an independent sample of existing data, and 2) establish the predictive and incremental validity the neural signature in the context of an ongoing randomized control trial of cognitive reappraisal training to reduce unhealthy eating in overweight and obese adults. Specifically, after development, I will test the construct validity of the neural signature by assessing whether expression of the signature is greater while participants reappraise their desire for craved food than while they simply view these foods (Aim 1). I will also test the predictive and incremental validity of the neural signature by assessing the extent to which individual differences the neural signature change predict intervention outcomes, such as the value of unhealthy food and eating behavior, above and beyond standard methods (Aim 2). Upon completion of this project, I will have developed and validated a sensitive and specific neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be readily used by other researchers to evaluate intervention efficacy and individual differences in responsivity to treatment. I will also receive in-depth training in translational neuroscience interventions for cancer control, and multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning. This work will facilitate the refinement of reappraisal-based interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity and risk for diet-related cancers. Further, by documenting my analysis process and sharing my analysis code, the results of this work can readily be adopted by others to study a variety of psychological processes relevant to eating behavior and cancer risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive reappraisal can be used to reduce food craving and unhealthy eating (a key risk factor for several kinds of cancer), but interventions to train reappraisal ability are not equally effective for all individuals. This project aims to leverage multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning techniques to develop an objective, neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be used to assess individual differences in treatment responsivity. The knowledge and research training gained from this project will prepare the trainee to build and refine interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and risk for diet-related cancers.",Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging,9756118,F31CA232357,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenicity', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'control trial', 'cost', 'craving', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'food craving', 'increased appetite', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'open source', 'parent grant', 'post intervention', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2019,39535,-0.011716729985532607
"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms.

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9768419,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,606526,0.0266030232635443
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones. This sensing platform will provide a fundamentally new method of obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders.",LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology,9720954,R01MH111610,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Psychologist', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Translating', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'health application', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microphone', 'mortality', 'negative mood', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment response', 'wearable device', 'wireless fidelity']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,800196,0.0035001222315065423
"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age.

"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9722990,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'sleep pattern', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,260797,0.008088792426735858
"Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY People vary in both the quantity and the quality of their sleep. Traditional sleep “stages” (for example, slow- wave sleep or REM sleep) can exhibit different neural correlates (as measured by electroencephalography, EEG) in different people and at different times during the night. Standard approaches for characterizing sleep (“staging”) do not take this variability into account, however. Here we suggest that attempts to use EEG and other data to infer sleep stages should in fact tackle the heterogeneity between and within individuals explicitly, to yield more accurate classification not just of an individual’s minute-by-minute sleep, but of the sleeper’s typical characteristics more generally. Quantitative, data-driven individual sleep profiles will be important prerequisites for emerging large-scale molecular genetics and other ‘omics studies of sleep, and for driving personalized sleep medicine more generally. Specifically, we propose to leverage more than ten thousand whole-night polysomnography (PSG) studies from the demographically diverse National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), in order to optimally apply machine-learning methods to sleep signals. Most importantly, the NSRR dataset will enable approaches that take the fundamental heterogeneity of sleep into account: this is a rate-limiting step that has not been tackled by previous approaches. We hypothesize that it is not the large training set per se, but rather the increased prospects for better-matched training data, combined with the methods developed here, that will be beneficial. To this end, we will build and disseminate a novel, multi-level automated sleep classifier based on the world’s largest dataset of sleep signals. PROJECT NARRATIVE People vary considerably not just in how much they sleep, but also in the types of sleep they typically have. Standard approaches to describing sleep, primarily developed in the 1960s, only partially capture this variability: we propose to use a range of measures, including brain activity, on over ten thousand sleeping individuals to generate more accurate, data-driven, personalized profiles of how a person's sleep varies over a night. Sleep factors are associated with multiple physical and neuropsychiatric illnesses, and so better measurement of the underlying processes will be critical for future genetic and biomarker studies aimed at understanding the links between sleep, health and disease.",Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling,9687195,R01HL146339,"['Adult', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mythology', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Polysomnography', 'Process', 'Property', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stage I Sleep', 'Stage II Sleep', 'Staging', 'Stretching', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'heuristics', 'implicit bias', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'molecular scale', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'sleep health', 'sleep onset', 'tool', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,451078,0.06952018717730009
"Smartband/smartphone-based automatic smoking detection and real time mindfulness intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US. Effective smoking cessation interventions are available but underutilized. Smoking cessation interventions delivered by smartphone apps are a promising tool for helping smokers quit. Delivery of treatments via smartphone apps may maximize the likelihood of use by smokers and the potential impact on smoking behavior. However, currently available smartphone apps for smoking cessation have not exploited their unique potential advantages to aid quitting. Notably, no available apps utilize wearable technologies; all current apps require users to self-report their smoking; and no apps deliver treatment automatically contingent upon smoking. Therefore, this pilot trial will test the feasibility of using a smartband to detect and track smoking and deliver brief smoking cessation interventions by smartphone app in real time. The interventions to be delivered will be brief mindfulness exercises that have been previously shown to reduce craving and smoking. This trial uses SmokeBeat, a novel mobile technology platform that uses multimodal data from wristband sensors to monitor and detect smoking, notify smokers about their smoking in real time and deliver real time interventions triggered by detected smoking episodes. SmokeBeat also applies machine learning to smoking tracking data to identify individual smoking patterns and deliver real time interventions targeted at predicted smoking episodes. This trial tests a three-step intervention to reduce smoking, in which smokers first become aware of their smoking and triggers by tracking smoking; then gain a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking by “mindful smoking”; and finally learn to work mindfully with cravings rather than smoke. Briefly, daily smokers (N=200, ≥5 cig/day) will wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a “mindful smoking” exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness exercise (“RAIN”: recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profile for 30 days post-quit. Aim 1 will be to determine treatment fidelity. Fidelity measures will be: (1) percent of smoking episodes correctly detected; (2) percent of “mindful smoking” exercises correctly triggered by smoking; and (3) users’ real time ratings of how timely “RAIN” was delivered to predicted smoking episodes. Aim 2 will be to determine adherence to treatment. Adherence measures will be: (1) percent of time spent wearing the smartband; (2) percent of smoking notifications answered; (3) percent of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings (e.g., timeliness and others) answered; and (4) percent of mindfulness exercises completed. Aim 3 will be to determine the acceptability of treatment. Acceptability measures will be: (1) average helpfulness ratings after each mindfulness exercise; (2) feedback on user experience surveys. Overall: this project tests a highly innovative technology-based mindfulness intervention for smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent developments in mobile technology suggest new and innovative ways to deliver effective smoking cessation treatments. This project will test the feasibility of using a smartband to automatically monitor and detect smoking and deliver real time mindfulness interventions via smartphone app to reduce smoking.

"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience.

Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time. The information provided by the AIM will be used to implement and test personalized, adaptable behavioral interventions aimed at the reduction of energy intake.",Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,9818246,R01DK122473,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Eating Disorders', 'Elderly', 'Energy Intake', 'Feedback', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthy Eating', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mastication', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'healthy weight', 'increased appetite', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'success', 'sucking', 'synergism', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'weight maintenance']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2019,663683,0.041091771033433463
"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs.

"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,9778822,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,660041,-0.01735831031178623
"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative network of leading behavioral scientists from multiple disciplines who conduct the experimental interventions, share research activities and findings, collaborate on joint projects, and brainstorm new intervention opportunities, building from findings in basic science. This application renews the NBER Roybal Center for the next five years. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Health is a foundational source of wellbeing for people of all ages. As resilient as human physiology may be, and as random and unexpected as health events may be to any particular person at any particular time, health is also affected by the lifestyle decisions that we make, our behavioral interactions with the medical care system, and how we respond to adverse health events when they occur.

"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. However, engaging in these healthy behaviors peaks during the childhood and adolescent years, and steeply deteriorates into emerging adulthood. Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions.

"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day. The findings of the study about healthy eating patterns will also improve dietary recommendations by adding messages on when and how often to eat during a day.",TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS,9659103,R01CA226937,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anthropometry', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calories', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Evaluation', 'Fasting', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'dietary guidelines', 'doubly-labeled water', 'epidemiology study', 'food consumption', 'good diet', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'prudent diet', 'tool', 'vector', 'waist circumference', 'western diet']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,347716,0.00848861664178355
"Enhanced Measurement and Modeling of Sleep Electrophysiology to Better Understand Sleep Disparities Project Summary Health disparities associated with race and ethnicity are a major public health issue in the United States. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that differences in people's quality and quantity of sleep may account for part of this problem. Here we wish to study patterns of sleep, using full polysomnography data in a large and diverse cohort, to better understand what causes some individuals and groups to differ in their typical sleep, and to link this variation in sleep to relevant health outcomes. In order to study sleep as a mediator of health disparities associated with race/ethnicity, we propose to first unpack the “sleep” term into profiles of quantitative traits (Aim 1). Second, we will test for demographic moderators of the associations between race/ethnicity and sleep traits, which can point to likely socioeconomic and social/environmental contextual mediators (Aim 2). Finally, we will demonstrate the relevance of these findings by testing for association with health outcomes – primarily cardiovascular disease risk and measures of allostatic load – and estimating the extent to which sleep accounts for racial/ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will apply a targeted array of data-driven analytic methods, from data science, machine learning, computational neuroscience and causal modeling, to characterize individual differences in patterns of sleep. A more nuanced understanding of what constitutes “poor sleep” is important because different aspects of sleep are likely to have qualitatively different links to demographic and biomedical factors, including age, sex, lifestyle factors, inherited genetic makeup, circadian rhythms, medication effects and current state of physical and mental health. By disentangling this network of inter-related variables, we will be better positioned to understand – and ameliorate – the effects of the numerous factors that can induce racial/ethnic disparities in sleep, and consequently, in health too. Project Narrative Health disparities associated with race and ethnicity are a major public health issue in the United States.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"From Cells to Societies: Mechanisms by Which Microbial Parasites Control Host Phenotypes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbes can be social. In some groups of microbes that have parasitic lifecycles the social behavior of the many microbial cells can lead to the precise control of the animal they infect. The microbes orchestrate within the body and coordinate to form interactions that are as impressive as any other collective behavior from fish shoals to flocks of birds to ant trails. In some biological systems the manipulated animal is an ant and therefore belongs to its own collective, the colony. In our system we study the `zombie-ant' fungi (Ophiocordyceps) of tropical and temperate forests, which precisely control ants to leave their nest and bite into vegetation directly over the foraging trails of the colony. The function of such altered behavior becomes apparent when the fungus kills the ant and grows a stalk from its head that shoots out spores that infect other ants. The goal of this application is o develop models of such complex collective behavior by fungi controlling ants. We will develop computational and physical diffusion models of the development of the fungal collective, within its ant host. We will use high throughput Scanning Electron Microscopy of ant muscles and computer vision algorithms to develop 3D computational models and accurate networks of cells. We will perform micro-acoustic fluidic experiments to measure fungal behavior and develop physical diffusion models of the emergence of collective behavior. At the macroscopic scale we will measure infected ant behavior in the forest and build agent-based models to determine the rules explaining the effective targeting of ant trails by the fungal collective using the ant as a vehicle. Finally, we will perform experiments to understand the role of competition for the social behavior of microbes. This work is a collaboration among David Hughes, an expert of animal behavior and parasites, Ephraim Hanks, an expert on models of animal behavior, Danny Chen, a computer scientist expert in 3D models of cells, Francesco Costanzo, a theoretical mechanical expert in physical diffusion models and Tony Huang, an engineer expert in micro-acoustic fluidic experiments. Extensive collaboration already exists among the five researchers and four of the five occupy the same building at Penn State, ensuring an easy collaboration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Fungal parasites can act as a group to control the behavior of ants to increase transmission to the next host. We will use a diversity of modeling approaches to study parasite social behavior across scales.

"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers.

"The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, course work, mentored laboratory training (practicum), and attendance to targeted conferences and seminars, with the common goal of supporting his transition to being an independent scientist. Project Narrative The overarching objective of this K01 career development award is to foster the transition of Dr. Azizi Seixas into an independent scientist in the area of sleep and cardiovascular disease and health disparities. The proposed study will investigate a novel mechanism underlying associations between insufficient sleep, obesity, and disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Findings from the study will be the basis of sleep and obesity interventions to reduce CVD risk, especially among diverse groups burdened by cardiovascular disease.",The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites,9618589,K01HL135452,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cholesterol', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Intolerance', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleeplessness', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'laboratory experience', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pedagogical content', 'post stroke', 'prevent', 'racial disparity', 'secondary analysis', 'sleep physiology', 'social health determinants', 'stroke survivor', 'symposium']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2019,179820,0.047131880375656014
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8.

We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9920544,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,86955,-0.013608341764188778

"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9701986,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2019,362004,0.038425226576229515
"The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored. In short, while poor sleep could be an important contributor to health disparities and accelerated aging, we know relatively little about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This K01 application will provide key training for career advancement and begin to close this gap in knowledge. To accomplish this goal, a randomized field experiment with 400 participants, each enrolled for over one month, in Chennai, India, will (1) objectively measure sleep and key environmental factors to provide preliminary evidence on the role of environmental causes of sleep deprivation in an urban environment, (2) rigorously evaluate two simple scalable interventions to reduce sleep deprivation among low-income adults in their natural environments, (3) estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision- making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, alcohol consumption), and earnings, and (4) utilizing questions regarding sleep asked of both RCT participants and a 50,000 person nationally-representative sample, estimate the extent of sleep deprivation and its impacts more broadly in urban India. The training aims underpinning the research aims and the applicant's long-term research goals are to expand knowledge and skills in: (1) cognitive psychology and the measurement of cognitive function, (2) aging, and (3) machine learning and predictive modeling. This training, accomplished through multiple avenues including coursework, directed study, and mentorship, will directly facilitate the proposed research and extend the scope and impact of the applicant's long-term research career studying health disparities and interactions between health and decision-making which may impact both cognitive and physical health as individuals age. Notably, while this application focuses on the impacts of sleep deprivation, the potential for health to shape decision-making is much broader. Constant exposure to other aspects of poor health associated with poverty, such as pain, also have the potential to exert a mental tax, leading to impaired cognition and poor decisions. Such a negative feedback loop between these factors and decision-making has the potential to further exacerbate health disparities. The far-reaching applicability of this idea beyond the direct scope of this proposal opens the door to high public-health significance through a wide variety of channels. Project narrative Although sleep has significant potential to impair cognition and impede health, relatively little is known about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This research will begin to close this gap in knowledge through a 400 person randomized trial in Chennai, India, which will objectively and rigorously measure sleep and key environmental factors impacting sleep, evaluate the impact of two simple and scalable interventions to improve sleep, and estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision-making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, tobacco consumption), and earnings. Providing rigorous evidence on these relationships and improving our collective understanding of the causes and costs to sleep deprivation, including not just direct health outcomes, but also shifts in preferences and decision-making directly relevant to health, will provide policy-relevant information important to improving health and healthy behaviors as well as promoting heathy and economically-secure aging.",The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India,9614849,K01AG055691,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Career Mobility', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Cost Measures', 'Decision Making', 'Developing Countries', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impaired health', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adverse outcome', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure reduction', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'diarrheal disease', 'disadvantaged population', 'discount', 'econometrics', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sleep health']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2019,127872,0.05003899586750168
"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans. In particular, social-environmental factors at the US-Mexico border may play an important role in sleep health disparities. This project will not only allow for increased understanding of the complex relationship among sleep, health, and social-environmental pressures, but through a community partnership it can maximize our ability to reduce these disparities. Also, this project has the added benefit of providing information about the role of sleep as a potentially modifiable factor in cardiovascular disease and diabetes disparities as well.",Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study,9672598,R01MD011600,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Metabolic', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'caucasian American', 'community partnership', 'diaries', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'food security', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'low density lipoprotein triglyceride', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'perceived stress', 'pressure', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'sample collection', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep health', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,717643,0.06223861452042683
"Administrative Supplement for Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT This application is in response to NOT-MD-19-023, which calls for proposals for expanding recruitment of projects to include Native Hawaiians / Other Pacific Islanders (NH/OPIs). Sleep disturbances, including short sleep duration, sleep apnea, and insomnia disorder, are highly prevalent among adults in the US and are associated with an increased risk for mental and physical health consequences including cardiometabolic disease. Comparative research studies indicate that sleep disparities are present in some minority populations; however, the extent to which sleep disparities exist across different racial/ethnic groups is not well known. Both Mexican-Americans and individuals from Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) populations are at an increased risk for adverse sleep and corresponding cardiometabolic health outcomes, yet the role of potential mechanisms linking such deficiencies in these comparative minority groups is understudied. Factors that impact sleep functioning in one population may differentially impact another population. The overall goal of this project is to support and strengthen two aims of the parent grant by specifically including NH/OPI into the Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep study to further evaluate how acculturation, psychosocial stressors, and other social, environmental, and behavioral factors impact relationships between sleep disturbances and cardiometabolic disease risk similarly and uniquely, as compared to Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border. This project aims to determine how acculturation, economic hardship, psychosocial stress, and unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking) are related to sleep disturbance by type in NH/OPI and in comparison to these relationships in Mexican-Americans. The second goal of this project is to determine how sleep and/or social-behavioral factors predict cardiometabolic disease risk among NH/OPI, as well as determine how these same factors are different in NH/OPI when compared to Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border. To accomplish these goals, this project will partner with researchers at the University of Hawaii to recruit and enroll N=100 NH/OPI to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry, collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. Inclusion of NH/OPI into the larger dataset will facilitate a better understanding of sleep disturbances and the impact of factors that regulate sleep, including duration, insomnia symptoms, and obstructive sleep apnea, in relation to cardiometabolic disease risk within this population and in comparison to Mexican-Americans. The analytic plan will utilize a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will further address efforts at reducing sleep-cardiometabolic health disparities in minority populations by identifying potentially modifiable areas associated with community-based intervention programs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are common and related to important health outcomes. This project expands the parent project by adding additional information regarding how sleep plays an important role in linking social/ environmental factors such as acculturation, stress, and health behaviors to cardiometabolic risk factors. Specifically, by expanding this project to include Native Hawaiians / Other Pacific Islanders, we can obtain new information about these relationships.",Administrative Supplement for Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study,9978525,R01MD011600,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic Visits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusion', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Hawaii', 'Hawaiian population', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'comparative', 'design', 'diaries', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic identity', 'experience', 'food security', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health disparity', 'intervention program', 'low density lipoprotein triglyceride', 'mortality', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'perceived stress', 'physical conditioning', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'sleep health', 'social', 'stressor']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,124869,0.0692407572829929
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9671858,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2019,613264,0.0326218066490456
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9702773,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,156798,0.03664802651602678

"Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders PROJECT SUMMARY Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a leading cause of injury and psychological distress among middle school-aged adolescents, and occurs at higher rates in youth exposed to harsh parenting. Tradi- tional intervention programs that target those at risk for perpetrating aggression due to harsh parenting have had only limited success. This lack of success may be due to the fact that aggression is the product of complex decision-making processes that are influenced by current states of attention, arousal, and affect. A different approach is to prevent aggression before it happens by interceding when nonverbal indices signal a shift in these critical states. An essential first step towards establishing this prevention-based approach is to isolate nonverbal behavior that reliably predicts forthcoming aggression in high-risk adolescents. Eye gaze, pupillary dilation, and facial expressions are strong nonverbal behavioral candidates given that they are well-established indices of attention, arousal, and affective states. The current proposal uses computational modeling to test the predictive link between these nonverbal behaviors elicited during an ecologically valid social rejection paradigm and subsequent expression of peer-based aggression in adolescents (11-14 years; N=80) with high and low exposure to harsh parenting. Results will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective, to develop next gen- eration interventions aimed at preventing aggression the moment its behavioral precursors are detected. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a costly public health problem that is inadequately addressed by existing interventions. The goal of this project is to implement computational modeling to predict aggression in low and high-risk youth using nonverbal behavior elicited during social rejection and aggression- related decision-making. Next generation interventions can then be designed to prevent aggression when these nonverbal indices are detected.",Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders,9755465,R21HD093912,"['14 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anger', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eyelid structure', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Testing', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aggression prevention', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'junior high school', 'male', 'next generation', 'novel', 'peer', 'physical model', 'predictive test', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'success', 'virtual']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2019,192906,-0.01752999948483009
"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will clarify why the majority of smokers relapse quickly following a quit attempt.",Neural basis of smoking relapse,9625742,R01DA041402,"['Abstinence', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Counseling', 'Cues', 'Economic Burden', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Investigation', 'Left', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Status', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral response', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'nicotine patch', 'nicotine replacement', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relapse risk', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking abstinence', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking cue', 'smoking relapse', 'stress reactivity', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,613163,0.01863332165772093
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9754578,R01CA190329,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Breathing', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Cigarette', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Geography', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inhalation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'arm movement', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cigarette smoke', 'cigarette smoking', 'cigarette user', 'data to knowledge', 'experience', 'field study', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'population health', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'uptake', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,581251,0.026148257450143906

"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9771304,F32HL143954,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Energy Intake', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'dietary adherence', 'digital', 'experience', 'falls', 'food consumption', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity treatment', 'prevent', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'sleep pattern', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment program', 'weight loss program', 'weight maintenance', 'willingness']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2019,60552,0.023984137806644632
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9712868,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2019,1612047,0.016900457370497345
"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis.

"VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems in the United States. A healthy dietary pattern is paramount in disease risk reduction. Since 2010, the dietary pattern approach has been recommended to examine the relation of the totality of diet and health outcomes by U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees; meanwhile longitudinal dietary data have become increasingly available. Yet, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing longitudinal diet-quality variations and even rudimentary for validating diet- quality patterns that describe these dynamic variations, therefore, leading to unclear evidence for assessing diet-health/disease relationships and formulating dietary guidelines. A noticeable gap exists between dietary pattern literature and the fast-growing statistical learning field. We propose to develop an innovative statistical learning tool for diet-quality trajectory pattern-recognition based on rich and highly-comparable longitudinal dietary datasets from randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies (OS) pertaining to a variety of individuals, race/ethnicities, and geographical locations, and spanning up to 30 years, collected across 4 NIH- funded RCTs in Massachusetts, and 2 large-scale multi-site national RCT and OS studies as well as simulated dietary data based on these trials. Our project builds on PI Fang’s NIH-funded behavioral trajectory pattern-recognition tool (Multiple-Imputation based Fuzzy Clustering, MIFuzzy) which processes longitudinal trial data with missing and zero-inflated values, and identifies latent trajectory patterns that characterize patients’ complex engagement and cognitive response variations during multi-component RCTs and better explains the heterogeneity of treatment effects. This project will enhance and expand MIFuzzy to a Visual- Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition tool (VIP), adapted to diet-quality trajectory pattern analyses and chronic disease risk assessment. Our goal is to provide a new multi-view of diet-quality trajectory patterns and associated outcomes from longitudinal studies. Based upon high-quality and comparable RCT and OS longitudinal dietary data from NIDDK-, NHLBI-, and NIMH-funded studies, this VIP project will help grow more valid evidence for developing dietary guidelines and clarify our understanding of diet-disease relationships for a range of patient/individual types, potentially enabling better personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Developing this evidence-based VIP tool will also contribute to the infrastructure for diet-related studies, advance pattern- recognition methods, help scientific communities and the lay public compare with local and national diet-quality guidelines, and assess dietary health risks. In the long run, this VIP project will contribute to creating a data management platform that support near-real-time pattern analyses and adaptive interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Evaluating diet quality and encouraging healthful dietary change is paramount for preventing, or managing, many chronic conditions and diseases, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our innovative Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern-recognition (VIP) method will identify clusters of distinct diet-quality patterns in multiple longitudinal dietary datasets from local and national NIH-funded randomized controlled trials and observational studies. This work will help formulate stronger evidence for national dietary guidelines, deepen our understanding of diet quality trajectory patterns, and elucidate relationships between these patterns and chronic diseases for a range of patient/individual types; it can potentially enable personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Open-access dissemination of our diet quality pattern recognition tool will contribute to the infrastructure of dietary-intervention studies, advance pattern recognition methodology, and help the scientific community and the public to compare individual dietary behaviors with local and national diet-quality patterns and associated health risks.",VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials,9907572,R56DK114514,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eating', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Reduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'dietary guidelines', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'field study', 'good diet', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH,R56,2019,452178,0.007948715654751588
"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will take existing research software and significantly enhance it so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",9882671,U24EB028990,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Budgets', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SMART health', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoking', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief intervention', 'burden of illness', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'good diet', 'handheld mobile device', 'healthy weight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'open data', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reduced substance use', 'repository', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'software development', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIBIB,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,399297,-0.006641574294859463
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes. n/a",Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry,9903672,R01GM135927,"['Accelerometer', 'Activity Cycles', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Big Data', 'Body Temperature', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Dust', 'Encapsulated', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Geometry', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'circadian', 'design', 'diaries', 'health related quality of life', 'heart rate monitor', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'metastatic colorectal', 'multimodality', 'personalized intervention', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,316425,0.007600092023939783
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Determinants of insufficient sleep among blacks and effects on disparities in health outcomes Project Summary Insufficient sleep (IS), stemming from sleep apnea, shift work, insomnia, working over 40 hr./week, unfavorable sleep environments and/or volitional reduction of bedtime, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers (elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and arterial stiffness), inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein) as well as with brain injury. Compelling evidence shows racial/ethnic disparities in insufficient sleep (IS), with blacks exhibiting a three-fold greater risk of IS relative to whites. Disparities might arise from physiologic and genetic factors, but recent evidence suggests environmental and psychosocial factors are also critical determinants. This study will utilize innovative dynamic modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants (associative factors) of actigraphic IS and its putative associations with adverse health outcomes among blacks. Individual- and contextual-level data will be captured using novel home-based recordings and GIS data to model the environmental context where sleep occurs. The proposed study will leverage success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup led by Dr. Jean- Louis (PI), who has been conducting community-engaged sleep research for over 10 years. The workgroup comprises outstanding investigators with expertise in sleep and circadian rhythm, CVD, brain health, health disparities, translational behavioral medicine, and multi-level dynamic modeling. The study will benefit from experience of our standing Community Steering Committee, enabling recruitment of 560 blacks in various venues to participate in weeklong home studies to achieve proposed study aims. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify psychosocial (social support, discrimination, and attitudes/beliefs) and environmental (household [density, noise, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, and neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with IS; ascertain effects of IS on (a) markers of CVD (obesity, BP, lipid profile, and glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and on (b) markers of brain injury (tau, amyloid-β, neurofilament light, homocysteine, and glial fibrillary acidic protein; and develop profiles of blacks with IS-related adverse health outcomes using individual- and environmental-level data applying innovative multi-level dynamic modeling tools (Bayesia Belief Network and Agent-Based Simulation). This study will provide evidence to delineate factors underlying greater rates of IS among blacks and explain putative associations with markers of CVD, inflammation, and brain injury. These data will provide the foundation for longitudinal studies assessing causal effects of IS on these novel markers and interventions to mitigate adverse effects of IS on health outcomes. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that blacks exhibit a three-fold greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and brain injury. It will provide multi-level evidence on the impact of the psychosocial and environmental factors on insufficient sleep among blacks.

"CRCNS: Unsupervised Learning of Hippocampal Sequence Dynamic in Sleep   In unit recordings from large populations of neurons, fast compressed sequential firing of neurons during rest and early sleep have been found to replay patterns first observed in active awake experience. These remarkable patterns have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community and beyond. Sequence  replay is now considered to play a critical role in the long-term stabilization and storage of mnemonically  important information. However, despite the general acknowledgement of the importance of the sequential structure, very little is known about the null background against which replay is compared. Specifically, are apparently 'non-replaying' spike patterns, as seen in late sleep, just simply noise? Because replay is typically assessed by comparison against a fixed known template, most methods can only determine whether the resemblance to the template is more than what might be expected from  random spike trains. But these methods cannot appraise whether other patterns remain in the nonsignificant events. Recently, the Diba and Kemere labs successfully collaborated to address precisely  this issue. We developed methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) to uncover temporal structure in spike trains of neurons in an unsupervised template-free manner. In this proposal, we aim to further improve these methods and to evaluate the hidden structure of spike trains in hippocampal  neuronal populations during sleep. In our second specific aim, we will use HMMs to determine both co-active ensemble (""contextual"") and temporal patterns (""sequential"") structure in hippocampal spike trains in both pre- and post-task sleep. In the third specific aim, we will probe the essence of sleep replay further, by exposing animals to multiple novel and familiar maze environments prior to long durations of sleep. In the fourth specific aim, we will perform closed-loop disruption of neuronal population patterns to  examine the causal interplay and reverberation of these patterns from early to late sleep. In summary, our  proposal is designed to provide strongest characterization to date of the structure of ""noise"" in replay events. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This study will provide an opening to evaluate the role of sleep in reorganizing information in the brain and  help to identify critical time windows and neuronal activities during sleep which are particularly important  for information storage and stabilization. Our assumptions and deductions about the nature and purpose  of sleep implicitly inform all manner of public policy, from the durations of shifts for hospital and relief  workers, to morning start times of public schools.

"Mentorship in the Endocrinology of Sleep The overarching goal of this application for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to foster training of promising junior investigators in cutting edge patient-oriented research related to how sleep biology influences cardiometabolic health. It capitalizes on the established network and resources of the recently renewed UCLA CTSI that includes a highly successful KL2 program. Dr. Liu led a competitively- funded Endocrine and Cardiometabolic Program in Sleep Biology at the University of Sydney, and since 2012, he has led a similar interdisciplinary research program in Los Angeles supported by a 5 year NHLBI R01 “Hormonal mechanisms of sleep restriction” that is currently in its 3rd year. During his 10 years of mentoring, he has trained 16 individuals: 10 remaining in academic medicine and 2 others in industry-related patient orientated research. Three of his trainees won major US young investigator awards under his supervision. He continues to support, mentor, and publish with former trainees, often long after they left his laboratory.  Disturbed sleep causes insulin resistance, promotes poor food choices, and curtails fat loss while dieting, thereby reducing the effectiveness of standard weight loss programs. However, the cardiometabolic consequences of disturbed sleep are not well recognized by the community, and the evidential bases to justify widespread changes to community sleeping patterns for cardiometabolic health reasons are evolving. Showing the mechanisms by which sleep restriction leads to cardiometabolic ill-health, particularly in older adults according to sex, are critical steps in providing these data. Dr. Liu's goal is to mentor the next cadre of independent clinical scientists focused on placing sleep alongside diet and exercise as part of healthy lifestyle, by understanding hormonal mechanisms and consequences of disrupted, inadequate or misaligned sleep.  The work proposed in this application fulfill these goals. Aim 1 will reveal the hypothalmo-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal mechanisms that cause testosterone-cortisol imbalance when sleep is restricted in older men and women (20 in each group). In doing so, trainees will learn endocrine physiology and chronobiological study design, IRB processes, recruitment skills, and hands-on study management. Aim 2 will identify sex differences in these mechanisms, trainees will learn statistical methods and abstract/presentation/ manuscript preparation. Aim 3 requires trainees to discover new mechanisms by which sleep restriction causes insulin resistance and alters appetite or food intake. Certain inflammatory mediators, hormones, or factors related to ethnicity or age could be studied. Aim 3 fulfils broader expectations for trainees to have a second project that is faster to accomplish, more exploratory, and driven by their interests and available resources, to develop a line of research that complements and is separate from that of the mentors. Taken together, these experiments will generate new knowledge of the relationship between sleep and hormonal cardiometabolic and reproductive health, provide wide-ranging training opportunities, and generate future R and K proposals. Narrative Insufficient sleep is common, and leads to insulin resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This proposal attempts to reveal the hormonal mechanisms underlying the link between insufficient sleep with insulin resistance in older adults, the population at greatest risk for disordered sleep and metabolic disorders as a vehicle to provide outstanding mentorship opportunities.",Mentorship in the Endocrinology of Sleep,9692343,K24HL138632,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Award', 'Biology', 'Carbohydrates', 'Catabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corticotropin', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Cosyntropin', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gonadal structure', 'Gonadotropin Hormone Releasing Hormone', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone imbalance', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Hunger', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ketoconazole', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Osteoporosis', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Sex Differences', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroid biosynthesis', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virulence Factors', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'bone age', 'cardiometabolism', 'diabetes risk', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'ganirelix', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hormonal signals', 'insulin sensitivity', 'interest', 'male', 'men', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'older men', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sex', 'skills', 'sleep pattern', 'targeted treatment', 'training opportunity', 'weight loss program', 'young adult']",NHLBI,LUNDQUIST INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION AT HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER,K24,2019,119586,0.019847322295964382
"Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias This fast track SBIR application submitted by Advanced Medical Electronics Corp. requests funds to develop a software system that helps people living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and other dementia to age in place and give them the choice whether and when to move. Staying at home is both preferred and less expensive, but there are a number of challenges to overcome. The proposed social interactive interface (SII), which uses augmented intelligence to both converse with the target demographic in natural language and analyze data from “Internet of Things” devices, will address these challenges by relieving problem behaviors and caregiver burden; increasing medication adherence; and reducing depression, social isolation, hospitalizations due to dehydration and urinary tract infections, thereby reducing the overall cost of care. The SII will learn behavioral trends and determine whether activities of daily living are completed. When unusual behavior is detected, it will alert the caregiver. If the SII determines a behavior problem may occur, then it will provide a just-in-time psychosocial intervention (e.g., reminisce therapy). Finally, the SII will keep schedules, provide reminders of upcoming events, and alerts when events are missed. AME will partner with SimpleC. In phase 1, we will prototype the social interactive interface and evaluate its feasibility. In phase 2, we will develop the social interactive interface, integrate it with the SimpleC platform, and evaluate its efficacy. Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases, and they cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed. Exploiting aspects of Cloud-based computing, SimpleC has developed an assistive technology tool based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver a non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and QOL in persons living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s, and other dementia. To help these people age in place, AME is partnering with SimpleC to create a software solution that will address the needs of those aging in place.","Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias",9977329,R44AG057364,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Calendar', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive aging', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'care costs', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'prevent', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychoeducational', 'psychosocial', 'sensor', 'social', 'software systems', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2019,788082,-0.034183620733492986
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,9838650,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2019,225000,-0.008362839923397382
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,9782867,R01CA234539,"['12 year old', '17 year old', '18 year old', '20 year old', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diffusion', 'Education', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Escalator', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Smoke-free home', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Status', 'Structural Models', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'aged', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparison group', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nicotine use', 'nicotine user', 'peer', 'prognostic', 'rate of change', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco user', 'young adult']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,432923,0.013451117178010617
"Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk ABSTRACT Whereas the majority of smokers will quit in any given year, the majority of quit attempts result in relapse. One reason interventions may fail is that they teach smokers strategies for coping with craving in response to environmental triggers, but do not provide smokers with just-in-time information about their risk of smoking lapse. Such risk information could be used to alert smokers to engage in relevant coping strategies including avoidance or use of quick acting pharmacotherapies (e.g. nicotine inhaler). The overarching premise of the proposed research is that prediction of lapse risk can be enhanced by using computer vision to analyze images of everyday life. Recent findings by our team suggest that environments associated with lapse risk can be detected in real-time by coupling deep learning-based object detection with an appropriate classification model. In preliminary research, images taken by smokers of smoking and nonsmoking environments (80 subjects, 2870 images) were used to train such a model, resulting in 77.5% accuracy (0.826 AUC) distinguishing these environments on a separate test set (16 subjects, 516 images). Encouraged by this preliminary finding, we propose to refine and scale up this system by a) creating a larger and more representative image database that includes a sample of everyday environments acquired from smokers (n=60) and b) testing novel, personalized approaches for increasing smoking environment classification accuracy and assessing smoking risk across three aims. In Aim 1, we will improve smoking environment classification accuracy and prediction of smoking risk by re-training an existing deep learning model to recognize a broad set of smoking-related objects (e.g. packs of cigarettes/ashtrays). In Aim 2, we will further improve performance by fitting personalized models that account for individual differences in preferred or typical smoking environments. In Exploratory Aim 3, we will predict craving and negative affect/stress using a similar approach. The proposed research represents an innovative and critical next step in the development of a system that identifies smoking risk and/or its antecedents in real-time to support a just-in-time adaptive intervention for smoking cessation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of smokers relapse within one month of quitting smoking. Environments (e.g. park) and their related objects (e.g. park bench) are associated with smoking and urges to smoke and can serve as triggers to lapse and relapse. The proposed research will use state-of-the-art computer vision and object detection to identify smoking risk environments and objects with the goal of eventually developing systems that alert smokers to such risks from everyday images acquired with cameras worn by smokers. Such a system can be incorporated into more comprehensive and effective smoking cessation programs.",Deep learning-based image analysis for assessing real-time smoking risk,9617141,R21DA047131,"['Adult', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nicotine Inhaler', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Shelter facility', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'coping', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'negative affect', 'non-smoking', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'time use']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,200208,0.01725620255917209
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9464374,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2018,470142,0.041920915537251524
"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9520535,R01MH111916,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breeding', 'Callithrix', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'feeding', 'gaze', 'human disease', 'human model', 'learning strategy', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'social communication', 'speech processing', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'vibration', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,549425,-0.020709324803463897
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9453227,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2018,166481,0.029131218524017972
"Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior  Using a Smart Wearable Device  Lifestyle and behavioral factors, such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, play important roles in human health. A recent report in Lancet has found that, globally, among the top-17 risk factors of human diseases, “diet risks”, “child and maternal malnutrition” and “low physical activity” ranked No.1, No. 3 and No. 14, respectively. Due to the increased adoption of unhealthy lifestyle, such as high-calorie, low-nutrient diet and decreased physical activity, chronic diseases are rising rapidly. For example, from 1980 to 2014, worldwide diabetic cases increased from 108 million to 422 million, and Americans’ life expectancy declined in 2015 for the first time since 1993. In order to assist the research community to study people’s lifestyle and develop effective interventional strategies, especially for chronic diseases such as diabetes to control their diet and increase physical activity, we have developed the eButton. The eButton is a miniature wearable computer pinned on the chest region to assess diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior. After several generations of redesigns, the eButton has now been shrunk to the size of an Oreo cookie while its functionality has greatly increased. We have conducted several studies evaluating the eButton with both adults and children. Our studies have shown that this device is well accepted by human subjects, and is suitable for collecting passively and conveniently large amounts of lifestyle data in real-life. However, post processing of field-collected data has been time-consuming, mainly due to required manual procedures to review thousands of images for identification of eating and other events of research interest. Privacy concerns were also expressed by some participants on recording images in their living and working environments and manual review of the recorded images. These significant problems must be solved before this important tool is utilized for large-scale clinical studies.  Powerful solution to solve these problems can be found in the most recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By equipping the eButton with the AI capacity, we can effectively transform this passive data collection device to a mini-robot that travels with the human subject, observes the world around it, takes quick notes (in English text) at an astonishing speed, stores these notes in a compact form within the eButton, and discards raw images immediately except for food images which may need a dietitian to analyze. If this new concept can be successfully implemented, there will be no need to review thousands of images, and the risk of privacy breach is avoided because sensitive images are no longer stored within the device. Since the eButton will only be taught to recognize a limited number of dietary activities, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, this device will produce the desired information of research interest, but will never cross the privacy intrusion boundary.  In this application, our team of experienced engineers and lifestyle scientists proposes to implement this new concept. We will develop an efficient human activity recognition algorithm personalized for each human subject. This algorithm utilizes both the subject’s daily routine information and the information extracted from selected sensors. The data from these sensors will be examined sequentially to test the validity of a number of candidate activities. We will develop miniature electronic circuits to implement a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within the eButton. This field- programmable gate array (FPGA) based implementation will enable real-time robotic reading of images and integrate the textual notes produced by the CNN with the personalized human activity recognition algorithm. Finally, we will perform a thorough evaluation study using human subjects to determine the accuracy of our activity recognition approach. This application aims to develop a personalized human activity recognition algorithm and to implement this algorithm using electronic hardware within a wearable device for the assessment of diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device",9717583,R56DK113819,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calories', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Descriptor', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietitian', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Malnutrition', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Wearable Computer', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'digital models', 'disorder risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'healthy lifestyle', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle factors', 'mathematical model', 'negative affect', 'programs', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,489821,0.03793067563456899
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9534747,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,663541,-0.023837070748483843
"From Cells to Societies: Mechanisms by Which Microbial Parasites Control Host Phenotypes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbes can be social. In some groups of microbes that have parasitic lifecycles the social behavior of the many microbial cells can lead to the precise control of the animal they infect. The microbes orchestrate within the body and coordinate to form interactions that are as impressive as any other collective behavior from fish shoals to flocks of birds to ant trails. In some biological systems the manipulated animal is an ant and therefore belongs to its own collective, the colony. In our system we study the `zombie-ant' fungi (Ophiocordyceps) of tropical and temperate forests, which precisely control ants to leave their nest and bite into vegetation directly over the foraging trails of the colony. The function of such altered behavior becomes apparent when the fungus kills the ant and grows a stalk from its head that shoots out spores that infect other ants. The goal of this application is o develop models of such complex collective behavior by fungi controlling ants. We will develop computational and physical diffusion models of the development of the fungal collective, within its ant host. We will use high throughput Scanning Electron Microscopy of ant muscles and computer vision algorithms to develop 3D computational models and accurate networks of cells. We will perform micro-acoustic fluidic experiments to measure fungal behavior and develop physical diffusion models of the emergence of collective behavior. At the macroscopic scale we will measure infected ant behavior in the forest and build agent-based models to determine the rules explaining the effective targeting of ant trails by the fungal collective using the ant as a vehicle. Finally, we will perform experiments to understand the role of competition for the social behavior of microbes. This work is a collaboration among David Hughes, an expert of animal behavior and parasites, Ephraim Hanks, an expert on models of animal behavior, Danny Chen, a computer scientist expert in 3D models of cells, Francesco Costanzo, a theoretical mechanical expert in physical diffusion models and Tony Huang, an engineer expert in micro-acoustic fluidic experiments. Extensive collaboration already exists among the five researchers and four of the five occupy the same building at Penn State, ensuring an easy collaboration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Fungal parasites can act as a group to control the behavior of ants to increase transmission to the next host. We will use a diversity of modeling approaches to study parasite social behavior across scales.

"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones. This sensing platform will provide a fundamentally new method of obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders.",LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology,9515970,R01MH111610,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Psychologist', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Translating', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'health application', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'negative mood', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment response', 'wearable device', 'wireless fidelity']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,802874,0.0035001222315065423
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9576355,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,672594,0.0266030232635443
"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms.

"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth.

"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. Findings have the potential to significantly impact research in this area and inform the further development of technology-enhanced observation methods for widespread, practical applications that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.",A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets,9586309,R21HL143553,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Error Sources', 'Expenditure', 'Eyeglasses', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Social Environment', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Trees', 'Walking', 'advanced system', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'national surveillance', 'novel strategies', 'physical inactivity', 'physical science', 'practical application', 'success', 'technology development', 'walkability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2018,232214,0.04332880919054198
"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9390493,R01MD010362,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Distal', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'behavior change', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cohesion', 'contextual factors', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'disability', 'distress tolerance', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'smoking abstinence', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,740378,0.013989959927575384
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,9524533,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,712358,-0.01735831031178623
"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9470193,F31HL140943,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alexithymias', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Anger', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Common Core', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'alcohol risk', 'allostasis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'graph theory', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,38124,-0.03858166315251866
"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. However, engaging in these healthy behaviors peaks during the childhood and adolescent years, and steeply deteriorates into emerging adulthood. Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life.

The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults. Results will be used to build more predictive health behavior theories and inform personalized behavior interventions to reduce obesity and improve public health.",Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance,9576883,U01HL146327,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Sleep', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Voice', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'demographics', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'emerging adulthood', 'ethnic diversity', 'improved', 'lifetime risk', 'mobile computing', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'theories', 'trend', 'weight gain prevention']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2018,100000,0.08415219700831163
"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9534484,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'men', 'mortality', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,298548,0.008088792426735858
"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies. Project Narrative Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper brain development and is linked to a variety of neurological and behavioral disorders. In particular, how animals correct for interrupted sleep cycles in future cycles could lead to therapeutic targets, but apart from a few implicated neuropeptides, little is known about the mechanisms behind this aspect of sleep. The objective of this proposal is to identify the roles of neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis by screening C. elegans mutants for behavioral defects.",An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics,9545566,F31GM123662,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drug Screening', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproduction', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Study models', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'age related', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cost', 'developmental genetics', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,44524,0.05418889540811658
"Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Fronto-temporal dementia and Vascular dementia. Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage day and night assessment technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer's and other dementias. The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated intially for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea but has more recently been applied to assess Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The AMP is unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real- time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine- learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud- based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for Alzheimer's and other neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need, Advanced Brain Monitoring (Carlsbad, CA) is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS), which will provide an inexpensive, non-invasive solution combining neurocognitive, electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EMG), and sleep-behavior assessment into a single, integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms.

"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9682871,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,40644,0.03211705840307496
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9577994,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2018,755313,-0.013608341764188778
"The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, course work, mentored laboratory training (practicum), and attendance to targeted conferences and seminars, with the common goal of supporting his transition to being an independent scientist. Project Narrative The overarching objective of this K01 career development award is to foster the transition of Dr. Azizi Seixas into an independent scientist in the area of sleep and cardiovascular disease and health disparities. The proposed study will investigate a novel mechanism underlying associations between insufficient sleep, obesity, and disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Findings from the study will be the basis of sleep and obesity interventions to reduce CVD risk, especially among diverse groups burdened by cardiovascular disease.",The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites,9412518,K01HL135452,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cholesterol', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Intolerance', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleeplessness', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'laboratory experience', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pedagogical content', 'post stroke', 'prevent', 'racial disparity', 'secondary analysis', 'social health determinants', 'stroke survivor', 'symposium']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2018,179820,0.047131880375656014
"Sensory Science and Metabolism; Molecular and Neuronal Mechanisms The  Sensory Science and Metabolism (SenSMet) laboratory under the leadership of Dr. Paule Joseph conducts translation and clinical inpatient and outpatient studies. Chemosensory perception (taste and smell) is determined by genetic, hormonal and metabolic factors. Both smell and taste information are sent to the feeding and reward system of the brain, playing a significant part in regulating eating behavior. Understanding the driving factors behind food choices is important for the dietary management of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The SenSMet laboratory had its inception in FY2018. Active collaborations to investigate areas of common interest in nutrition, taste, and obesity have been undertaken.  Specifically, two double-blind clinical protocols for which sensory phenotyping measures have been implemented.   Genetic and metabolic translational applications in obesity research include our recent investigation of microRNA (miR) signaling pathways in metabolic syndrome and fatty liver disease (MetS-FL) pathogenesis. Based on the previously reported MetS-FL miR trio of hsa-miR-142-3p, hsa-miR-18b, and hsa-miR-890, we examined an epithelial-focused miR network in colorectal cell models. Transfection of CRL-1790 cells with MetS-FL miR mimics led to global changes in cellular miRNome profiles, such as altered miR expression. Colon-specific changes in epithelial barriers, cell junction structure, and a miRNome signaling network are described in this study of a MetS-FL miR trio signature (Joseph et al., 2018).  Given that accurate prediction of obesity risk utilizing genetic data remains challenging, we reported a new mathematical method to predict obesity genetic risk through computational biology approaches from collaborative intramural clinical studies.  Genetic risk score was computed by adding body mass index (BMI)-increasing alleles. The genetic risk score was significantly correlated with BMI when an optimization algorithm was used that excluded some SNPs. Linear regression and support vector machine models were built to predict obesity risk using gene expression profiles and the genetic risk score. Our computational framework serves as an example for bioinformatic utility with genetic information to predict obesity risk for specific cohorts (Joseph et al., 2018). In a linked cohort of patients, we found discordance between perception and physiology as it relates to eating behavior, stress and adiposity. The purpose of the study was to examine the interrelationships among stress, eating behavior, and adiposity in a cohort of normal- and overweight individuals.  Following a cross-sectional and descriptive analysis, significant correlations were found between Disinhibition and Hunger eating behavior subscales and measures of adiposity including BMI and percent body fat. Disinhibition and Hunger correlated positively with perceived stress. Future studies are warranted to better understand the effects of perceived and physiological stress on eating behavior (Joseph et al., 2018).  We conducted a State of the Science of Childhood Obesity review to examine literature regarding the determinants of food choice and genetic markers influencing adolescent obesity over the past decade. The results highlighted the research gap within this specific cohort, including merging adolescent participants with younger children. Also, the results demonstrated the importance of several factors, such as genetics/genomics and socioeconomic status on adolescent obesity. In addition, future studies that focus on adolescent obesity are warranted as well as the implication of precision health in obesity treatment and interventions (Campbell, Franks and Joseph, 2018). n/a",Sensory Science and Metabolism; Molecular and Neuronal Mechanisms,9784517,ZIANR000035,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent obesity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colon', 'Colorectal', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Epithelial', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fatty Liver', 'Food', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hunger', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intercellular Junctions', 'Intervention', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Precision Health', 'Prevention', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smell Perception', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Transfection', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'collaborative approach', 'computer framework', 'feeding', 'genetic information', 'improved', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome research', 'multiple omics', 'neuromechanism', 'nutrition', 'obesity genetics', 'obesity in children', 'obesity management', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'operation', 'satisfaction', 'sensory system', 'transcriptomics']",NINR,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH,ZIA,2018,367156,-0.014852813916832927
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9513489,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2018,705027,-0.008114796562635192
"The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored. In short, while poor sleep could be an important contributor to health disparities and accelerated aging, we know relatively little about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This K01 application will provide key training for career advancement and begin to close this gap in knowledge. To accomplish this goal, a randomized field experiment with 400 participants, each enrolled for over one month, in Chennai, India, will (1) objectively measure sleep and key environmental factors to provide preliminary evidence on the role of environmental causes of sleep deprivation in an urban environment, (2) rigorously evaluate two simple scalable interventions to reduce sleep deprivation among low-income adults in their natural environments, (3) estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision- making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, alcohol consumption), and earnings, and (4) utilizing questions regarding sleep asked of both RCT participants and a 50,000 person nationally-representative sample, estimate the extent of sleep deprivation and its impacts more broadly in urban India. The training aims underpinning the research aims and the applicant's long-term research goals are to expand knowledge and skills in: (1) cognitive psychology and the measurement of cognitive function, (2) aging, and (3) machine learning and predictive modeling. This training, accomplished through multiple avenues including coursework, directed study, and mentorship, will directly facilitate the proposed research and extend the scope and impact of the applicant's long-term research career studying health disparities and interactions between health and decision-making which may impact both cognitive and physical health as individuals age. Notably, while this application focuses on the impacts of sleep deprivation, the potential for health to shape decision-making is much broader. Constant exposure to other aspects of poor health associated with poverty, such as pain, also have the potential to exert a mental tax, leading to impaired cognition and poor decisions. Such a negative feedback loop between these factors and decision-making has the potential to further exacerbate health disparities. The far-reaching applicability of this idea beyond the direct scope of this proposal opens the door to high public-health significance through a wide variety of channels. Project narrative Although sleep has significant potential to impair cognition and impede health, relatively little is known about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This research will begin to close this gap in knowledge through a 400 person randomized trial in Chennai, India, which will objectively and rigorously measure sleep and key environmental factors impacting sleep, evaluate the impact of two simple and scalable interventions to improve sleep, and estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision-making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, tobacco consumption), and earnings. Providing rigorous evidence on these relationships and improving our collective understanding of the causes and costs to sleep deprivation, including not just direct health outcomes, but also shifts in preferences and decision-making directly relevant to health, will provide policy-relevant information important to improving health and healthy behaviors as well as promoting heathy and economically-secure aging.",The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India,9452529,K01AG055691,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Career Mobility', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Cost Measures', 'Decision Making', 'Developing Countries', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impaired health', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adverse outcome', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure reduction', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'disadvantaged population', 'discount', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sleep health']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2018,127872,0.05003899586750168
"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans. In particular, social-environmental factors at the US-Mexico border may play an important role in sleep health disparities. This project will not only allow for increased understanding of the complex relationship among sleep, health, and social-environmental pressures, but through a community partnership it can maximize our ability to reduce these disparities. Also, this project has the added benefit of providing information about the role of sleep as a potentially modifiable factor in cardiovascular disease and diabetes disparities as well.",Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study,9523633,R01MD011600,"['Acculturation', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Health Centers', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Metabolic', 'Mexican', 'Mexican Americans', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'caucasian American', 'community partnership', 'diaries', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'food security', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'low density lipoprotein triglyceride', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'pressure', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'sample collection', 'sleep health', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,772060,0.06223861452042683
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9470866,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2018,345436,0.038425226576229515
"Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Title: Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Abstract  Chronic disease management is largely dependent upon individuals’ engagement in adoption and modification of one or more health behaviors (e.g. medication adherence, daily exercise, smoking cessation) over long term. Despite prevalence of theory-guided behavior change interventions, behavior modification is oftentimes a chronic, relapsing effort in and of itself. The effect of social relationships and behavior change has been well documented, nonetheless, rarely infused into health interventions. Our understanding of (a) the mechanisms through which such influence affects human behaviors, and (b) how such influence can be harnessed to improve the effectiveness of theory-guided behavioral interventions is limited. In the proposed research, we will develop a set of semi-automated methods to characterize the interrelation between theory driven stages of behavior change and social influence models of human behavior in group settings, as embedded in user generated interactions on a health-related online community. While generally applicable, the methods will be developed based on communications among individuals attempting to quit smoking in an online community, QuitNet, the first online social network for smoking cessation. Advanced text analytics will be used to identify and extract the stages and processes of behavior change. Stage-oriented network affiliation models will then be used to characterize the interdependencies among social actors, behavioral processes, and behavioral states. This research proposal will result in 1) novel methods to incorporate behavioral stages and processes into network models of social influence; 2) scalable techniques to automate identification of behavioral stage through text annotation of user interactions; and 3) new proposals for the development of digital interventions and technology features that harness social ties and theoretical roots to support individuals engaging in health behavior change and chronic disease management.     This project investigates the manifestation of behavior change processes and stages in online social discourse focusing smoking cessation. As a component of the proposed research we will integrate automated text analysis and network models to understand social mechanisms and influence patterns underlying electronically captured peer-to-peer communication related to behavior modification.

"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9601212,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,195600,0.03664802651602678

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9394010,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual response', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2018,1639153,0.042331081978737396
"Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders PROJECT SUMMARY Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a leading cause of injury and psychological distress among middle school-aged adolescents, and occurs at higher rates in youth exposed to harsh parenting. Tradi- tional intervention programs that target those at risk for perpetrating aggression due to harsh parenting have had only limited success. This lack of success may be due to the fact that aggression is the product of complex decision-making processes that are influenced by current states of attention, arousal, and affect. A different approach is to prevent aggression before it happens by interceding when nonverbal indices signal a shift in these critical states. An essential first step towards establishing this prevention-based approach is to isolate nonverbal behavior that reliably predicts forthcoming aggression in high-risk adolescents. Eye gaze, pupillary dilation, and facial expressions are strong nonverbal behavioral candidates given that they are well-established indices of attention, arousal, and affective states. The current proposal uses computational modeling to test the predictive link between these nonverbal behaviors elicited during an ecologically valid social rejection paradigm and subsequent expression of peer-based aggression in adolescents (11-14 years; N=80) with high and low exposure to harsh parenting. Results will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective, to develop next gen- eration interventions aimed at preventing aggression the moment its behavioral precursors are detected. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a costly public health problem that is inadequately addressed by existing interventions. The goal of this project is to implement computational modeling to predict aggression in low and high-risk youth using nonverbal behavior elicited during social rejection and aggression- related decision-making. Next generation interventions can then be designed to prevent aggression when these nonverbal indices are detected.",Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders,9791513,R21HD093912,"['14 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anger', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eyelid structure', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Testing', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aggression prevention', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'junior high school', 'male', 'next generation', 'novel', 'peer', 'physical model', 'predictive test', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'success', 'virtual']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2018,232781,-0.01752999948483009
"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9442751,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2018,673206,0.0326218066490456
"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,9647728,R01CA234539,"['12 year old', '17 year old', '18 year old', '20 year old', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diffusion', 'Education', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Escalator', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Smoke-free home', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Status', 'Structural Models', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'aged', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparison group', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'nicotine use', 'nicotine user', 'peer', 'prognostic', 'rate of change', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco user', 'young adult']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,446068,0.013451117178010617
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9547313,R01CA190329,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Breathing', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Cigarette', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Geography', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inhalation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'arm movement', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cigarette smoke', 'cigarette smoking', 'cigarette user', 'data to knowledge', 'experience', 'field study', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'population health', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'uptake', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,1,0.026148257450143906
"Pre-clinic model for sleep deprivation-induced obesity and hedonic intake due to noise exposure Easy access to calories and poor sleep independently increase eating and weight gain. Sleep deprivation (SD) increases hedonic intake (eating palatable food for pleasure) and in humans environmental noise exposure causes SD, is detrimental to health and increases obesity risk. We have shown that noise (pre-recorded random city sounds) causes SD, hyperphagia and weight gain in male rats, which is novel and replicates human data. Yet this methodology must be established in female rodents as sex is a critical biological variable. The overall goal is to establish the method of SD by noise to induce obesity in female rodents, use the model to define the contribution of hedonic intake to SD-induced obesity and use these data to develop a non- invasive method to distinguish types of sleep (REM vs. non-REM). Aim 1 will use statistical learning methods and data mining to quantify REM and non-REM based on data collected from studies in this proposal (food intake, physical activity energy expenditure, EEG, EMG) and will establish SD by noise in females as a pre- clinical model for obesity due to SD. We will compare sleep disruption caused by noise exposure and the gentle handling technique; test whether sex moderates the effect of noise exposure on sleep, weight gain and food intake and whether Suvorexant (used clinically for insomnia) normalizes sleep in noise-exposed rats. Finally, data mining will be completed to address a critical need in the sleep field: to develop a high-throughput, non-invasive technique to distinguish REM vs. non-REM in rats. In humans, SD increases hedonic intake, which promotes obesity. Taste preference is highly variable and may modulate hedonic intake caused by SD. We show clear individual taste preferences for snacks using a cafeteria (CAF) diet protocol (i.e. rotating selection of palatable human snacks plus rodent chow ad lib). We also show SD by noise increases chocolate intake in sated rats with low initial preference for chocolate and maintains intake in rats with high preference. Thus, SD by noise may increase intake of palatable foods that would normally be avoided during adequate sleep. Aim 2 will test if the effects of SD by noise on hedonic intake and obesity are dependent upon sex and individual taste preferences in rats. We will test whether SD increases binge chocolate intake and intake of CAF diet snacks. The scientific premise is: SD in increases hedonic intake and promotes obesity in humans; environmental noise promotes SD in humans; and our pre-clinical model mirrors the human response to SD. We hypothesize that like male rats, SD due to noise will cause obesity in females and increase hedonic intake despite individual preference to in turn worsen obesity. The innovation lies in establishing a simple method of SD that replicates human SD-induced obesity; developing a non-surgical method to measure sleep types; and identifying how individual preferences affects hedonic intake and obesity caused by SD. Its significance lies in establishing a translational model of SD independent of sex to identify mechanisms underlying reward behavior and obesity propensity due to SD, with the ultimate goal of developing novel anti-obesity therapies. The goal of these studies is to establish our method of sleep deprivation by environmental noise to induce obesity, and use this model to define the contribution of hedonic intake to obesity due to sleep deprivation in humans. Studies will employ a novel method of partial sleep deprivation by noise, which mimics weight gain in sleep deprived humans. We propose to establish sleep deprivation by noise in females rats, as we have shown in males, as a pre-clinical model for obesity due to sleep deprivation, develop a non-invasive method to distinguish REM from non-REM sleep based on food intake, physical activity, energy expenditure, EEG and EMG data, in lieu of EEG/EMG recordings, and define the effects of sleep deprivation by noise on hedonic intake and its influence on obesity in males and female rats. Completing these studies will provide a valid translational pre-clinical model of sleep deprivation to identify how sleep deprivation alters reward behavior, eating and obesity propensity, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies against obesity.",Pre-clinic model for sleep deprivation-induced obesity and hedonic intake due to noise exposure,9525441,R21NS099468,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Welfare', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Weight', 'Calories', 'Chocolate', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperphagia', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'REM Sleep', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleeplessness', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Study models', 'Taste preferences', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adequate sleep', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'data mining', 'defined contribution', 'experience', 'feeding', 'food consumption', 'hedonic', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'noise pollution', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'obesity risk', 'pleasure', 'preference', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep quality', 'sound', 'translational model', 'urban area']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2018,188446,0.031327776758841325
"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9609565,F32HL143954,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Energy Intake', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'falls', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity treatment', 'prevent', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment program', 'weight loss program', 'weight maintenance', 'willingness']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2018,58282,0.023984137806644632
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9464147,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2018,1524997,0.016900457370497345
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. To address our aims we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of approximately 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans.",Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race,9390802,K01HL127278,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Biometry', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Inflammation', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Modification', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'caucasian American', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'lifestyle factors', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'response']",NHLBI,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2018,136036,-0.009739216605663454
"Mentorship in the Endocrinology of Sleep The overarching goal of this application for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to foster training of promising junior investigators in cutting edge patient-oriented research related to how sleep biology influences cardiometabolic health. It capitalizes on the established network and resources of the recently renewed UCLA CTSI that includes a highly successful KL2 program. Dr. Liu led a competitively- funded Endocrine and Cardiometabolic Program in Sleep Biology at the University of Sydney, and since 2012, he has led a similar interdisciplinary research program in Los Angeles supported by a 5 year NHLBI R01 “Hormonal mechanisms of sleep restriction” that is currently in its 3rd year. During his 10 years of mentoring, he has trained 16 individuals: 10 remaining in academic medicine and 2 others in industry-related patient orientated research. Three of his trainees won major US young investigator awards under his supervision. He continues to support, mentor, and publish with former trainees, often long after they left his laboratory.  Disturbed sleep causes insulin resistance, promotes poor food choices, and curtails fat loss while dieting, thereby reducing the effectiveness of standard weight loss programs. However, the cardiometabolic consequences of disturbed sleep are not well recognized by the community, and the evidential bases to justify widespread changes to community sleeping patterns for cardiometabolic health reasons are evolving. Showing the mechanisms by which sleep restriction leads to cardiometabolic ill-health, particularly in older adults according to sex, are critical steps in providing these data. Dr. Liu's goal is to mentor the next cadre of independent clinical scientists focused on placing sleep alongside diet and exercise as part of healthy lifestyle, by understanding hormonal mechanisms and consequences of disrupted, inadequate or misaligned sleep.  The work proposed in this application fulfill these goals. Aim 1 will reveal the hypothalmo-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal mechanisms that cause testosterone-cortisol imbalance when sleep is restricted in older men and women (20 in each group). In doing so, trainees will learn endocrine physiology and chronobiological study design, IRB processes, recruitment skills, and hands-on study management. Aim 2 will identify sex differences in these mechanisms, trainees will learn statistical methods and abstract/presentation/ manuscript preparation. Aim 3 requires trainees to discover new mechanisms by which sleep restriction causes insulin resistance and alters appetite or food intake. Certain inflammatory mediators, hormones, or factors related to ethnicity or age could be studied. Aim 3 fulfils broader expectations for trainees to have a second project that is faster to accomplish, more exploratory, and driven by their interests and available resources, to develop a line of research that complements and is separate from that of the mentors. Taken together, these experiments will generate new knowledge of the relationship between sleep and hormonal cardiometabolic and reproductive health, provide wide-ranging training opportunities, and generate future R and K proposals. Narrative Insufficient sleep is common, and leads to insulin resistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This proposal attempts to reveal the hormonal mechanisms underlying the link between insufficient sleep with insulin resistance in older adults, the population at greatest risk for disordered sleep and metabolic disorders as a vehicle to provide outstanding mentorship opportunities.",Mentorship in the Endocrinology of Sleep,9522654,K24HL138632,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Award', 'Biology', 'Carbohydrates', 'Catabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corticotropin', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Cosyntropin', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Physiology', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gonadal structure', 'Gonadotropin Hormone Releasing Hormone', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone imbalance', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Hunger', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ketoconazole', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Osteoporosis', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroid biosynthesis', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virulence Factors', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'bone age', 'cardiometabolism', 'diabetes risk', 'diet and exercise', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'ganirelix', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hormonal signals', 'insulin sensitivity', 'interest', 'male', 'men', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'older men', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sex', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'training opportunity', 'weight loss program', 'young adult']",NHLBI,LUNDQUIST INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION AT HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER,K24,2018,119586,0.019847322295964382
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9519046,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'societal costs', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2018,620198,-0.0096707149780219
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9290961,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2017,441204,0.041920915537251524
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9346616,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,172086,-0.01305223966937244
"From Cells to Societies: Mechanisms by Which Microbial Parasites Control Host Phenotypes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbes can be social. In some groups of microbes that have parasitic lifecycles the social behavior of the many microbial cells can lead to the precise control of the animal they infect. The microbes orchestrate within the body and coordinate to form interactions that are as impressive as any other collective behavior from fish shoals to flocks of birds to ant trails. In some biological systems the manipulated animal is an ant and therefore belongs to its own collective, the colony. In our system we study the `zombie-ant' fungi (Ophiocordyceps) of tropical and temperate forests, which precisely control ants to leave their nest and bite into vegetation directly over the foraging trails of the colony. The function of such altered behavior becomes apparent when the fungus kills the ant and grows a stalk from its head that shoots out spores that infect other ants. The goal of this application is o develop models of such complex collective behavior by fungi controlling ants. We will develop computational and physical diffusion models of the development of the fungal collective, within its ant host. We will use high throughput Scanning Electron Microscopy of ant muscles and computer vision algorithms to develop 3D computational models and accurate networks of cells. We will perform micro-acoustic fluidic experiments to measure fungal behavior and develop physical diffusion models of the emergence of collective behavior. At the macroscopic scale we will measure infected ant behavior in the forest and build agent-based models to determine the rules explaining the effective targeting of ant trails by the fungal collective using the ant as a vehicle. Finally, we will perform experiments to understand the role of competition for the social behavior of microbes. This work is a collaboration among David Hughes, an expert of animal behavior and parasites, Ephraim Hanks, an expert on models of animal behavior, Danny Chen, a computer scientist expert in 3D models of cells, Francesco Costanzo, a theoretical mechanical expert in physical diffusion models and Tony Huang, an engineer expert in micro-acoustic fluidic experiments. Extensive collaboration already exists among the five researchers and four of the five occupy the same building at Penn State, ensuring an easy collaboration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Fungal parasites can act as a group to control the behavior of ants to increase transmission to the next host. We will use a diversity of modeling approaches to study parasite social behavior across scales.

"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group.

"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment.

"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9361299,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,706183,-0.018544863651213064
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9383530,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,666777,-0.023837070748483843
"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9537132,R01MD010362,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Distal', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'behavior change', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cohesion', 'contextual factors', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'disability', 'distress tolerance', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social health determinants', 'tool']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,810198,0.013989959927575384
"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9357585,UH2EB024407,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genetic makeup', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'surveillance study', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'ubiquitous computing', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,300665,-0.02084376574317179
"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9210068,R21CA194492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical Education', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Sports', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'population health', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'software systems', 'teacher', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2017,152937,0.042179538740304376
"Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS). The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), a recently developed Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH-funded SBIR Phase I/II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies. With integrated measures of submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements, the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine-learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to develop a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process.

"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9360318,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'men', 'mortality', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,353303,0.008088792426735858
"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies. Project Narrative Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper brain development and is linked to a variety of neurological and behavioral disorders. In particular, how animals correct for interrupted sleep cycles in future cycles could lead to therapeutic targets, but apart from a few implicated neuropeptides, little is known about the mechanisms behind this aspect of sleep. The objective of this proposal is to identify the roles of neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis by screening C. elegans mutants for behavioral defects.",An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics,9396432,F31GM123662,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproduction', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Study models', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'age related', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cost', 'developmental genetics', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2017,44044,0.05418889540811658
"Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Fronto-temporal dementia and Vascular dementia. Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage day and night assessment technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer's and other dementias. The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated intially for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea but has more recently been applied to assess Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The AMP is unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real- time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine- learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud- based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for Alzheimer's and other neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process.

"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9341673,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment effect', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2017,589358,-0.008114796562635192
"The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, course work, mentored laboratory training (practicum), and attendance to targeted conferences and seminars, with the common goal of supporting his transition to being an independent scientist. Project Narrative The overarching objective of this K01 career development award is to foster the transition of Dr. Azizi Seixas into an independent scientist in the area of sleep and cardiovascular disease and health disparities. The proposed study will investigate a novel mechanism underlying associations between insufficient sleep, obesity, and disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Findings from the study will be the basis of sleep and obesity interventions to reduce CVD risk, especially among diverse groups burdened by cardiovascular disease.",The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites,9228453,K01HL135452,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cholesterol', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Intolerance', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleeplessness', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'laboratory experience', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pedagogical content', 'post stroke', 'prevent', 'racial disparity', 'secondary analysis', 'social health determinants', 'stroke survivor', 'symposium']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2017,179820,0.047131880375656014
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Title: Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Abstract  Chronic disease management is largely dependent upon individuals’ engagement in adoption and modification of one or more health behaviors (e.g. medication adherence, daily exercise, smoking cessation) over long term. Despite prevalence of theory-guided behavior change interventions, behavior modification is oftentimes a chronic, relapsing effort in and of itself. The effect of social relationships and behavior change has been well documented, nonetheless, rarely infused into health interventions. Our understanding of (a) the mechanisms through which such influence affects human behaviors, and (b) how such influence can be harnessed to improve the effectiveness of theory-guided behavioral interventions is limited. In the proposed research, we will develop a set of semi-automated methods to characterize the interrelation between theory driven stages of behavior change and social influence models of human behavior in group settings, as embedded in user generated interactions on a health-related online community. While generally applicable, the methods will be developed based on communications among individuals attempting to quit smoking in an online community, QuitNet, the first online social network for smoking cessation. Advanced text analytics will be used to identify and extract the stages and processes of behavior change. Stage-oriented network affiliation models will then be used to characterize the interdependencies among social actors, behavioral processes, and behavioral states. This research proposal will result in 1) novel methods to incorporate behavioral stages and processes into network models of social influence; 2) scalable techniques to automate identification of behavioral stage through text annotation of user interactions; and 3) new proposals for the development of digital interventions and technology features that harness social ties and theoretical roots to support individuals engaging in health behavior change and chronic disease management.     This project investigates the manifestation of behavior change processes and stages in online social discourse focusing smoking cessation. As a component of the proposed research we will integrate automated text analysis and network models to understand social mechanisms and influence patterns underlying electronically captured peer-to-peer communication related to behavior modification. By enabling the study of content-specific communication events focusing on specific stages of change, the proposed research will provide actionable insights into the development of socio-behavioral interventions that target online communities and consider users’ behavioral state and stage.

The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9508669,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cost', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2017,162828,0.042331081978737396
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9308944,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2017,339155,0.038425226576229515
"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9284636,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2017,566219,0.0326218066490456
"Pre-clinic model for sleep deprivation-induced obesity and hedonic intake due to noise exposure Easy access to calories and poor sleep independently increase eating and weight gain. Sleep deprivation (SD) increases hedonic intake (eating palatable food for pleasure) and in humans environmental noise exposure causes SD, is detrimental to health and increases obesity risk. We have shown that noise (pre-recorded random city sounds) causes SD, hyperphagia and weight gain in male rats, which is novel and replicates human data. Yet this methodology must be established in female rodents as sex is a critical biological variable. The overall goal is to establish the method of SD by noise to induce obesity in female rodents, use the model to define the contribution of hedonic intake to SD-induced obesity and use these data to develop a non- invasive method to distinguish types of sleep (REM vs. non-REM). Aim 1 will use statistical learning methods and data mining to quantify REM and non-REM based on data collected from studies in this proposal (food intake, physical activity energy expenditure, EEG, EMG) and will establish SD by noise in females as a pre- clinical model for obesity due to SD. We will compare sleep disruption caused by noise exposure and the gentle handling technique; test whether sex moderates the effect of noise exposure on sleep, weight gain and food intake and whether Suvorexant (used clinically for insomnia) normalizes sleep in noise-exposed rats. Finally, data mining will be completed to address a critical need in the sleep field: to develop a high-throughput, non-invasive technique to distinguish REM vs. non-REM in rats. In humans, SD increases hedonic intake, which promotes obesity. Taste preference is highly variable and may modulate hedonic intake caused by SD. We show clear individual taste preferences for snacks using a cafeteria (CAF) diet protocol (i.e. rotating selection of palatable human snacks plus rodent chow ad lib). We also show SD by noise increases chocolate intake in sated rats with low initial preference for chocolate and maintains intake in rats with high preference. Thus, SD by noise may increase intake of palatable foods that would normally be avoided during adequate sleep. Aim 2 will test if the effects of SD by noise on hedonic intake and obesity are dependent upon sex and individual taste preferences in rats. We will test whether SD increases binge chocolate intake and intake of CAF diet snacks. The scientific premise is: SD in increases hedonic intake and promotes obesity in humans; environmental noise promotes SD in humans; and our pre-clinical model mirrors the human response to SD. We hypothesize that like male rats, SD due to noise will cause obesity in females and increase hedonic intake despite individual preference to in turn worsen obesity. The innovation lies in establishing a simple method of SD that replicates human SD-induced obesity; developing a non-surgical method to measure sleep types; and identifying how individual preferences affects hedonic intake and obesity caused by SD. Its significance lies in establishing a translational model of SD independent of sex to identify mechanisms underlying reward behavior and obesity propensity due to SD, with the ultimate goal of developing novel anti-obesity therapies. The goal of these studies is to establish our method of sleep deprivation by environmental noise to induce obesity, and use this model to define the contribution of hedonic intake to obesity due to sleep deprivation in humans. Studies will employ a novel method of partial sleep deprivation by noise, which mimics weight gain in sleep deprived humans. We propose to establish sleep deprivation by noise in females rats, as we have shown in males, as a pre-clinical model for obesity due to sleep deprivation, develop a non-invasive method to distinguish REM from non-REM sleep based on food intake, physical activity, energy expenditure, EEG and EMG data, in lieu of EEG/EMG recordings, and define the effects of sleep deprivation by noise on hedonic intake and its influence on obesity in males and female rats. Completing these studies will provide a valid translational pre-clinical model of sleep deprivation to identify how sleep deprivation alters reward behavior, eating and obesity propensity, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies against obesity.",Pre-clinic model for sleep deprivation-induced obesity and hedonic intake due to noise exposure,9386535,R21NS099468,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Welfare', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Weight', 'Calories', 'Chocolate', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperphagia', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'REM Sleep', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleeplessness', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Study models', 'Taste preferences', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'data mining', 'defined contribution', 'experience', 'feeding', 'food consumption', 'hedonic', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'noise pollution', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'obesity risk', 'pleasure', 'preference', 'response', 'sex', 'sound', 'urban area']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2017,227208,0.031327776758841325
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9490765,R01CA190329,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Breathing', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cereals', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Cigarette', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Geography', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'arm movement', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cigarette smoking', 'data to knowledge', 'experience', 'field study', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'population health', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'uptake', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,641479,0.026148257450143906
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias Project Summary/Abstract This fast track SBIR application submitted by Advanced Medical Electronics Corp. requests funds to develop a software system that helps people living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementia to age in place and give them the choice whether and when to move. Staying at home is both preferred and less expensive, but there are a number of challenges to overcome. The proposed social interactive interface (SII), which uses augmented intelligence to both converse with the target demographic in natural language and analyze data from “Internet of Things” devices, will address these challenges by relieving problem behaviors and caregiver burden; increasing medication adherence; and reducing depression, social isolation, hospitalizations due to dehydration and urinary tract infections, thereby reducing the overall cost of care. The SII will learn behavioral trends and determine whether activities of daily living are completed. When unusual behavior is detected, it will alert the caregiver. If the SII determines a behavior problem may occur, then it will provide a just-in-time psychosocial intervention (e.g., reminisce therapy). Finally, the SII will keep schedules, provide reminders of upcoming events, and alerts when events are missed. AME will partner with SimpleC. In phase 1, we will prototype the social interactive interface and evaluate its feasibility. In phase 2, we will develop the social interactive interface, integrate it with the SimpleC platform, and evaluate its efficacy. Project Narrative Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases, and they cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed. Exploiting aspects of Cloud-based computing, SimpleC has developed an assistive technology tool based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver a non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and QOL in persons living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's, and other dementia. To help these people age in place, AME is partnering with SimpleC to create a software solution that will address the needs of those aging in place.","Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias",9409961,R44AG057364,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Calendar', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive aging', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'prevent', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychoeducational', 'psychosocial', 'sensor', 'social', 'software systems', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2017,224986,-0.03702904975032933
"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although quitting smoking is the most important action a smoker can take to prevent cancer, cessation has proven difficult.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9285614,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2017,747607,-0.0096707149780219
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9030093,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,542228,0.041920915537251524
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9180261,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,221705,-0.01305223966937244
"From Cells to Societies: Mechanisms by Which Microbial Parasites Control Host Phenotypes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbes can be social. In some groups of microbes that have parasitic lifecycles the social behavior of the many microbial cells can lead to the precise control of the animal they infect. The microbes orchestrate within the body and coordinate to form interactions that are as impressive as any other collective behavior from fish shoals to flocks of birds to ant trails. In some biological systems the manipulated animal is an ant and therefore belongs to its own collective, the colony. In our system we study the `zombie-ant' fungi (Ophiocordyceps) of tropical and temperate forests, which precisely control ants to leave their nest and bite into vegetation directly over the foraging trails of the colony. The function of such altered behavior becomes apparent when the fungus kills the ant and grows a stalk from its head that shoots out spores that infect other ants. The goal of this application is o develop models of such complex collective behavior by fungi controlling ants. We will develop computational and physical diffusion models of the development of the fungal collective, within its ant host. We will use high throughput Scanning Electron Microscopy of ant muscles and computer vision algorithms to develop 3D computational models and accurate networks of cells. We will perform micro-acoustic fluidic experiments to measure fungal behavior and develop physical diffusion models of the emergence of collective behavior. At the macroscopic scale we will measure infected ant behavior in the forest and build agent-based models to determine the rules explaining the effective targeting of ant trails by the fungal collective using the ant as a vehicle. Finally, we will perform experiments to understand the role of competition for the social behavior of microbes. This work is a collaboration among David Hughes, an expert of animal behavior and parasites, Ephraim Hanks, an expert on models of animal behavior, Danny Chen, a computer scientist expert in 3D models of cells, Francesco Costanzo, a theoretical mechanical expert in physical diffusion models and Tony Huang, an engineer expert in micro-acoustic fluidic experiments.

"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group. The development of this computer science technology is the first step toward automating the eCoaching process.",Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating,9181203,R21DK108071,"['21 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communication Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Food', 'Future Generations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Investigator-Initiated Research', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Social Work', 'Son', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive task', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'digital', 'effective intervention', 'emerging adulthood', 'evidence base', 'fruits and vegetables', 'good diet', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intrinsic motivation', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'new technology', 'point of care', 'primary outcome', 'public health intervention', 'rural area', 'satisfaction', 'sugar', 'sweetened beverage', 'young adult']",NIDDK,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,237377,0.004777206548315043
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals.

"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.        ",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9078547,UH2EB024407,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'fitness', 'genetic makeup', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'learning network', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'surveillance study', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'ubiquitous computing', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,299438,-0.02084376574317179
"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.                ",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9035822,R21CA194492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical Education', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Sports', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'population health', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'software systems', 'teacher', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2016,199277,0.042179538740304376
"Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS). The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), a recently developed Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH-funded SBIR Phase I/II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies. With integrated measures of submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements, the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine-learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to develop a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need, Advanced Brain Monitoring (Carlsbad, CA) is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS), which will provide an inexpensive, non-invasive solution combining neurocognitive, electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EMG), and sleep-behavior assessment into a single, integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms.

"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,9132699,R01CA179977,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'High Fat Diet', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer risk', 'collaborative environment', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'obesogenic', 'physical inactivity', 'residence', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sugar', 'tv watching', 'walkability']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,816993,-0.012199594719348845
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9157753,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary activity', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2016,400434,0.038425226576229515
"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will clarify why the majority of smokers relapse quickly following a quit attempt.        ",Neural basis of smoking relapse,9079131,R01DA041402,"['Abstinence', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Counseling', 'Cues', 'Economic Burden', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Insula of Reil', 'Investigation', 'Left', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Status', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral response', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'nicotine patch', 'nicotine replacement', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relapse risk', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'stress reactivity', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,523814,0.01863332165772093

"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally.

"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans.

"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving.

"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8891470,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'motor impairment', 'named group', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2015,223669,0.01829742093103278
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of socioeconomic status, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, context/environment, and acute precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit.                ","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",8965058,R01CA190329,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Cohort Studies', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Trust', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'distress tolerance', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'interest', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mindfulness', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social health determinants', 'stressor']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,665384,0.016802423749354985
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed. The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.",Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit,8840546,R01CA164993,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Cancer Control', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Housekeeping', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marshal', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'computerized data processing', 'epidemiologic data', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'novel', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'temporal measurement', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,536065,0.05590401824889104
"Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with substantial adverse consequences including motor vehicle and other accidents, impaired cognition, impaired immune function, altered mood, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. The gold standard test for assessing the physiology of sleep is the polysomnogram suffers from a number of well-recognized limitations. These limitations decrease the capacity of sleep researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from sleep disorders. (PSG). Currently employed PSG technology Our long-term goal is to address the shortcomings of current PSG methodology by developing a low cost, low for automated assessment of sleep physiology. We hypothesize that this would be possible by expanding the types of brain assessments carried out to include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) where recent evidence suggests that the low frequency hemodynamic oscillation reflect sleep stage-related changes in brain function. NIRS also simultaneously provides cerebral oxygen saturation, heart rate and breathing rate estimates. In this application, we propose to design, build, and test power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system a proof-of-principle prototype system combining diffuse optical spectroscopic, electrophysiological, and inertial . This system will have the form factor of an adhesive bandage which will disturb and limit subjects to a far lesser degree than traditional PSG systems. We will use supervised machine learning-based methods to explore NIRS features specific to sleep stages and clinically relevant events. Other innovations include recording inertial signals and incorporating adaptive signal processing in order to remove artifacts and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and using commercial-off-the-shelf proximity sensor circuitry to support the NIRS front-end. measurement capabilities If successful, this project will lead to improved capacity to carry out sleep research and to detect and treat sleep disorders. The proposed methodology would test whether novel clinically relevant NIRS parameters can be explored enabling further understanding of sleep physiology. The miniaturization, low cost, and low power consumption of our new NIRS-based wireless system would pave the way for rapid adoption and deployment of these bandages for home-use in real-world settings. Given the high prevalence and substantial impairments associated with sleep disorders, this project has the potential to have a major positive impact on public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative A review carried out by the Institute of Medicine concluded that 50-70 million people in the United States suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness which diminishes their ability to function, adversely impacts their health, and decreases longevity. Current systems for objectively monitoring sleep physiology and diagnosing sleep disorders suffer from a number of widely-recognized shortcomings that limit the capacity of researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and sleep disorders and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from these conditions. Our long term goal is to develop a low cost, low power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system for automated assessment of sleep physiology which addresses these shortcomings. The specific objective of this proposal is to investigate the capability of a miniaturized, wireless near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) system to achieve this. As such, the proposed project has the potential to improve the lives of the millions of people suffering from sleep disorders.",Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting,8930756,R21NS085818,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Bandage', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lithium', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Movement', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Polymers', 'Polysomnography', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleeplessness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wakefulness', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'immune function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sleep onset']",NINDS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2015,148458,0.05402694249814527
"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8906825,R01CA179977,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer risk', 'collaborative environment', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'residence', 'sedentary', 'sugar', 'tv watching']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,751279,-0.012199594719348845
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8897409,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,521457,-0.04673564882432799
"Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock regulates physiology and behavior and impinges on many aspects of our daily life. Nowhere is this more obvious than control of the sleep wake cycle, where clock genes have been shown to play a role in both the timing of sleep and its quality. For example, mutations in PER2 cause familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), while mutations in  CSNK1E and CSNK1D cause FASPS and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS),  respectively. However, while we have learned much about the clock and how it regulates sleep, the picture is incomplete. Behavioral studies in mice and studies in human cells show that dozens to hundreds of loci impact circadian clock function. However, only a dozen genes have been investigated for their roles in regulating behavior. Testing dozens to hundreds of mice isn't practical, so a new approach is needed. Here we seek to address this gap with a novel strategy that uses, i) integrative bioinformatics to prioritize putative core clock factors, ii) new experimental methods to determine whether they interact with known clock genes and regulate clock function in several cellular or tissue slice models, and, finally, iii) for a subset of promising candidates, generate mouse models and test them for their roles in regulating circadian behavior and sleep. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans. Our internal biological clocks control many important aspects of our physiology and behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Genetics and large-scale genomic studies have implicated the role of a dozen canonical and hundreds of additional new genes in the circadian clock.  However, almost none of the new genes have been studied in animal models for their ability to regulate sleep onset or quality. We will address this gap using bioinformatics, experimental biology, and finally through behavioral analysis. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.","Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock",8825538,R01NS054794,"['Address', 'Adipocytes', 'Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome', 'Disease', 'Fibroblasts', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Knockout Mice', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Slice', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'data integration', 'evidence base', 'fly', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'improved', 'knockout animal', 'luminescence', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neurogenetics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reverse genetics', 'screening', 'sleep onset', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,557700,0.0261061250789541
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected.

"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics.

"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving - Supplement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although quitting smoking is the most important action a smoker can take to prevent cancer, cessation has proven difficult.

"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although quitting smoking is the most important action a smoker can take to prevent cancer, cessation has proven difficult. Given observed relations between craving and smoking relapse, novel approaches to craving relief are sorely needed.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8935645,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,652270,-0.0096707149780219
"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.                ",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8749880,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'named group', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2014,204427,0.01829742093103278
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is a leading preventable cause of death, responsible for one in five deaths annually in the United States alone. Many adult smokers want to or try to quit smoking, but, are unable to do so due to lack of personalized cessation treatments that ultimately leads to successful quitting. The primary hurdle has been the unavailability of technology that can be used to collect continuous measurements of stress contexts in field on predictors of abstinence and relapse. Without these measurements, it is difficult to understand the psychophysiological and biobehavioral stress mechanisms that may predict smoke lapse. This application proposes to use a new field deployable tool called AutoSense that was developed under NIH's GEI program to collect personal psychophysiological measures of stress and mediating social and environmental contexts in the natural environment of individuals to discover signatures of early relapse. AutoSense consists of several wireless sensors (e.g., ECG, respiration, triaxial accelerometer) attached to a chest band that transmit sensor measurements wirelessly to a smart phone. Fine-grained measurement of physiology enables computation of physiological measures that are predictive of stress such as minute ventilation and heart rate variability. The project uses sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate stress levels, smoking episodes and conversation episodes from physiological measurements. In addition, accelerometers are used to identify changes in posture and physical activity, and GPS measurements on the mobile phone are used to identify location and transportation modality. Seventy-two smokers who want to quit will be recruited. Two weeks prior to quit date, they will wear AutoSense for 24h in the field. Behavioral treatment for abstinence will begin in their visit to the lab prior to quitting. They wil wear AutoSense for 72h in the field, beginning on the quit date. In addition to collecting continuous measurements across all sensors, smoking and lapse events will be self-reported. Saliva samples will be collected for cortisol assessment, in addition to physiological measures of stress. Participants will report back to the lab one week after the quit date to determine smoking/lapse status. The aim of this project is to identify psychophysiological measures of stress and environmental cues that may predict early lapse. First, it will discover patterns in physiological and hormonal measures in response to withdrawal stress and acute stress that may predict lapse in the first week. Second, it will investigate the role of social and environmental context such as conversation behavior (e.g., duration and frequency of conversations), lifestyle factors (e.g., time spent in seated posture and in commuting), location (time spent at home vs. office), and indoor/outdoor status in mediating the relationship between stress and early lapse.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse. Given the adverse impact of smoking on smokers and non-smokers, such advancement will significantly improve the quality of life and reduce public health burden.",Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context,8720744,R01DA035502,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Commuting', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Moderate Exercise', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Posture', 'Productivity', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'Withholding Treatment', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'cigarette smoking', 'coping', 'cost', 'hazard', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'non-smoker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'social', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2014,412836,0.028384608567625595
"Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with substantial adverse consequences including motor vehicle and other accidents, impaired cognition, impaired immune function, altered mood, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. The gold standard test for assessing the physiology of sleep is the polysomnogram suffers from a number of well-recognized limitations. These limitations decrease the capacity of sleep researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from sleep disorders. (PSG). Currently employed PSG technology Our long-term goal is to address the shortcomings of current PSG methodology by developing a low cost, low for automated assessment of sleep physiology. We hypothesize that this would be possible by expanding the types of brain assessments carried out to include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) where recent evidence suggests that the low frequency hemodynamic oscillation reflect sleep stage-related changes in brain function. NIRS also simultaneously provides cerebral oxygen saturation, heart rate and breathing rate estimates. In this application, we propose to design, build, and test power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system a proof-of-principle prototype system combining diffuse optical spectroscopic, electrophysiological, and inertial . This system will have the form factor of an adhesive bandage which will disturb and limit subjects to a far lesser degree than traditional PSG systems. We will use supervised machine learning-based methods to explore NIRS features specific to sleep stages and clinically relevant events. Other innovations include recording inertial signals and incorporating adaptive signal processing in order to remove artifacts and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and using commercial-off-the-shelf proximity sensor circuitry to support the NIRS front-end. measurement capabilities If successful, this project will lead to improved capacity to carry out sleep research and to detect and treat sleep disorders. The proposed methodology would test whether novel clinically relevant NIRS parameters can be explored enabling further understanding of sleep physiology. The miniaturization, low cost, and low power consumption of our new NIRS-based wireless system would pave the way for rapid adoption and deployment of these bandages for home-use in real-world settings. Given the high prevalence and substantial impairments associated with sleep disorders, this project has the potential to have a major positive impact on public health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative A review carried out by the Institute of Medicine concluded that 50-70 million people in the United States suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness which diminishes their ability to function, adversely impacts their health, and decreases longevity. Current systems for objectively monitoring sleep physiology and diagnosing sleep disorders suffer from a number of widely-recognized shortcomings that limit the capacity of researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and sleep disorders and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from these conditions. Our long term goal is to develop a low cost, low power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system for automated assessment of sleep physiology which addresses these shortcomings. The specific objective of this proposal is to investigate the capability of a miniaturized, wireless near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) system to achieve this. As such, the proposed project has the potential to improve the lives of the millions of people suffering from sleep disorders.            ",Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting,8771722,R21NS085818,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Bandage', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lithium', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Movement', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Polymers', 'Polysomnography', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleeplessness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wakefulness', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'immune function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sleep onset']",NINDS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2014,265759,0.05402694249814527
"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.

"Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder (RBD) refers to a condition in which patients act out their dreams and engage in potentially disruptive, injurious and even dangerous behavior while asleep[1-3]. Clinical reports of RBD have been shown to anticipate the development of neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease by 20 years or more [4-6]. Despite this potential prognostic significance for human disease, the field of Sleep Medicine lacks an accepted computerized approach to quantify muscle activity in sleep. This proposed interdisciplinary research seeks to merge methods of computer engineering based computation with advanced neuroscience to establish a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to detect RBD via measurement and analysis of the phasic electromyographic activity metric (PEM). The sponsor (Bliwise) has provided evidence based on traditional visual analyses from ""expert"" scorers that PEM recorded during sleep is a sensitive indicator a) to differentiate PD patients from controls [7]; b) to distinguish non-PD patients with a history of RBD from controls [8]; and c) to differentiate PD patients with early and late stage disease [9]. These data suggest that computer-aided PEM detection within a user-friendly CDSS will be vital for clinicians to determine prognosis, track disease course, and, possibly, even monitor treatment.           The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.

"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally.

"Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock regulates physiology and behavior and impinges on many aspects of our daily life. Nowhere is this more obvious than control of the sleep wake cycle, where clock genes have been shown to play a role in both the timing of sleep and its quality. For example, mutations in PER2 cause familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), while mutations in  CSNK1E and CSNK1D cause FASPS and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS),  respectively. However, while we have learned much about the clock and how it regulates sleep, the picture is incomplete. Behavioral studies in mice and studies in human cells show that dozens to hundreds of loci impact circadian clock function. However, only a dozen genes have been investigated for their roles in regulating behavior. Testing dozens to hundreds of mice isn't practical, so a new approach is needed. Here we seek to address this gap with a novel strategy that uses, i) integrative bioinformatics to prioritize putative core clock factors, ii) new experimental methods to determine whether they interact with known clock genes and regulate clock function in several cellular or tissue slice models, and, finally, iii) for a subset of promising candidates, generate mouse models and test them for their roles in regulating circadian behavior and sleep. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.             Our internal biological clocks control many important aspects of our physiology and behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Genetics and large-scale genomic studies have implicated the role of a dozen canonical and hundreds of additional new genes in the circadian clock.  However, almost none of the new genes have been studied in animal models for their ability to regulate sleep onset or quality. We will address this gap using bioinformatics, experimental biology, and finally through behavioral analysis. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.

We continue to develop new methodologies and refine existing portable accelerometry for the quantifying physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep which resulted in four publications. The Steeves (a current Cancer Prevention Fellow) et al. paper was resulted from a collaboration study with NCI colleagues investigating two market-available raw-signal accelerometers potential to differentiate common human physical activity types when worn at the hip vs. on the thigh. We discovered the advantages of each monitors and at each positions and further highlighted the paths for improvements. When analyzing accelerometer and chamber data from my previous work at Vanderbilt University, Tracy et al. found a new decision-tree algorithm to delineate sleeping from non-sleep resting movement patterns, which enhances our ability to quantify sedentary behavior in the free living. We also worked with NIA collaborators in exploring the activity patterns in aging populations in the NHANES accelerometer database, and discovered that women continue engaging in common daily activities into older age more than men. Findings may help inform the development of behavioral interventions to increase intensity and overall activity levels, particularly in older adults (Martin et al.). Finally, Troiano et al. reviewed technical advancements in objective monitoring of physical activities and sedentary behaviors in the current research environment, how researchers and developers from multiple disciplines are responding to the analytic challenges and how advances in data storage, transmission and big data computing will minimize logistical challenges.  2.	We completed two short-term trials in FY13: 13-DK-0212 was a multi-center trial that involved four research centers with seven total respiration chambers of different designs and instruments, plus accelerometers for activity monitoring. I was designated as the investigator in charge of cross-validating and quality control of all centers. The data is being analyzed currently in our Core. Moreover, the unique design of this trial put a heavy demand on the respiration chambers (as the primary outcome measure) during FY13, both in terms of chamber days for patient studies as well as for calibrations and validations. 13-DK-0136 was a single-site randomized crossover trial on the metabolic effects by an experimental melanocortin-4 receptor agonist in obese volunteers. Using the high sensitivity of the respiration chamber, we designed the study with only twelve study participants. The paper was submitted and is being reviewed.  3.

"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING  PROJECT ABSTRACT Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance. Our results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA and the BE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to combine computer science and public health to use online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to enumerate global physical activity patterns and built environment characteristics. Webcams and crowdsourcing will be evaluated for reliability and validity. Results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA patterns and BE characteristics.            ",EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING,8620889,R21CA186481,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Archives', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Feeds', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Social Sciences', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198360,0.04143191474845473
"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette craving is a vital feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of cancer. While smokers generally recognize this danger, during ""hot"" moments of temptation the appeal of smoking a cigarette rises, previously learned coping skills or ""quit-smoking"" messages may be either ignored or abandoned, and often the smoking habit persists. Despite its importance, research has struggled to develop effective treatments for craving relief and new innovative approaches are sorely needed. The proposed project addresses RFA-CA- 12-015: Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions (PQA3) by evaluating a novel bio-behavioral approach to help smokers reduce their cigarette cravings. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings. In addition - and pertinent to the RFA - this research tests a range of individual difference factors such as working memory, personality, motivation to quit, and gender, which prior theory and research suggest should moderate the craving-reducing effects of olfactory cues. As a consequence, the project will advance knowledge of why certain individuals may have particular trouble managing their cravings and refraining from smoking.  Abstinent smokers (N=250) with varying motivations to quit will attend a multi-session experiment. Initially participants will sample and rate a serie of olfactory cues on several dimensions, including pleasantness, familiarity, and associated memories. Participants then will be exposed to in vivo smoking cues, which in the context of smoking abstinence, produce robust cigarette cravings. While at peak craving, they will be randomly assigned to sniff an odor that they had previously rated as either being most pleasant (and unrelated to smoking), a tobacco odor, or a neutral odor while urge, mood, and a novel set of craving-related responses derived from basic research in cognition and emotion (including Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System) will be assessed. This research also will test key mechanisms of craving relief that relate to existing theories of craving and addiction. In addition the project will monitor the durability of this predicted odor- induced craving-relief within a sinle experimental session and across sessions conducted on different days.  This conceptually-driven research is motivated by neurobiological and behavioral research indicating the unique power of olfaction to trigger emotional memories and to fundamentally alter emotional states such as craving. The proposed project will examine interactions between emotional and cognitive processes that, while craving, may serve to hamper effective coping, and will set the stage for future research testing the impact of olfaction - alone or combined with other agents (e.g., nicotine patches) - on smoking cessation. Irrespective of the outcome, the proposed research using a novel set of measures will provide critical data regarding the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although quitting smoking is the most important action a smoker can take to prevent cancer, cessation has proven difficult. Given observed relations between craving and smoking relapse, novel approaches to craving relief are sorely needed. Integrating basic theory and research derived from three disciplines that rarely have been applied to smoking research (olfaction, emotion, and cognition), the proposed project aims to test the effectiveness of specific olfactory cues to reduce cigarette cravings, setting the stage fr future research testing its value as a component of a smoking cessation intervention.            ",An Olfactory Method for Controlling Cigarette Craving,8685449,R01CA184779,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coping Skills', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Familiarity', 'Gender', 'Habits', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personality', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Smell Perception', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Vision research', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'addiction', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'coping', 'craving', 'effective therapy', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'nicotine patch', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'olfactory stimulus', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'theories']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,301587,0.003829119828045057
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8815713,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2014,709980,-0.0096707149780219
"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.        Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.

"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children. Cost-effective, non-intrusive, valid and precise methods for the quantitative assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity are essential to determine patterns of physical activity, prevalence and determinants, dose-response relationships between physical activity and health outcomes, and intervention effectiveness in preschool-aged children. We will develop models to assess physical activity and to predict energy expenditure in preschoolers using advanced technology (room calorimetry, doubly labeled water, accelerometers, miniaturized heart rate monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques that capture the dynamic nature of physical activity and energy expenditure in preschool-aged children.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is a leading preventable cause of death, responsible for one in five deaths annually in the United States alone. Many adult smokers want to or try to quit smoking, but, are unable to do so due to lack of personalized cessation treatments that ultimately leads to successful quitting. The primary hurdle has been the unavailability of technology that can be used to collect continuous measurements of stress contexts in field on predictors of abstinence and relapse. Without these measurements, it is difficult to understand the psychophysiological and biobehavioral stress mechanisms that may predict smoke lapse. This application proposes to use a new field deployable tool called AutoSense that was developed under NIH's GEI program to collect personal psychophysiological measures of stress and mediating social and environmental contexts in the natural environment of individuals to discover signatures of early relapse. AutoSense consists of several wireless sensors (e.g., ECG, respiration, triaxial accelerometer) attached to a chest band that transmit sensor measurements wirelessly to a smart phone. Fine-grained measurement of physiology enables computation of physiological measures that are predictive of stress such as minute ventilation and heart rate variability. The project uses sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate stress levels, smoking episodes and conversation episodes from physiological measurements. In addition, accelerometers are used to identify changes in posture and physical activity, and GPS measurements on the mobile phone are used to identify location and transportation modality. Seventy-two smokers who want to quit will be recruited. Two weeks prior to quit date, they will wear AutoSense for 24h in the field. Behavioral treatment for abstinence will begin in their visit to the lab prior to quitting. They wil wear AutoSense for 72h in the field, beginning on the quit date. In addition to collecting continuous measurements across all sensors, smoking and lapse events will be self-reported. Saliva samples will be collected for cortisol assessment, in addition to physiological measures of stress. Participants will report back to the lab one week after the quit date to determine smoking/lapse status. The aim of this project is to identify psychophysiological measures of stress and environmental cues that may predict early lapse. First, it will discover patterns in physiological and hormonal measures in response to withdrawal stress and acute stress that may predict lapse in the first week. Second, it will investigate the role of social and environmental context such as conversation behavior (e.g., duration and frequency of conversations), lifestyle factors (e.g., time spent in seated posture and in commuting), location (time spent at home vs. office), and indoor/outdoor status in mediating the relationship between stress and early lapse.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse. Given the adverse impact of smoking on smokers and non-smokers, such advancement will significantly improve the quality of life and reduce public health burden.            ",Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context,8542814,R01DA035502,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Commuting', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Moderate Exercise', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Posture', 'Productivity', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'Withholding Treatment', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'cigarette smoking', 'coping', 'cost', 'hazard', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'non-smoker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'social', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2013,433185,0.028384608567625595
"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.                ",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8590146,R01CA179977,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'residence', 'sedentary', 'sugar', 'tv watching']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,733604,-0.012199594719348845
"Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder (RBD) refers to a condition in which patients act out their dreams and engage in potentially disruptive, injurious and even dangerous behavior while asleep[1-3]. Clinical reports of RBD have been shown to anticipate the development of neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease by 20 years or more [4-6]. Despite this potential prognostic significance for human disease, the field of Sleep Medicine lacks an accepted computerized approach to quantify muscle activity in sleep. This proposed interdisciplinary research seeks to merge methods of computer engineering based computation with advanced neuroscience to establish a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to detect RBD via measurement and analysis of the phasic electromyographic activity metric (PEM). The sponsor (Bliwise) has provided evidence based on traditional visual analyses from ""expert"" scorers that PEM recorded during sleep is a sensitive indicator a) to differentiate PD patients from controls [7]; b) to distinguish non-PD patients with a history of RBD from controls [8]; and c) to differentiate PD patients with early and late stage disease [9]. These data suggest that computer-aided PEM detection within a user-friendly CDSS will be vital for clinicians to determine prognosis, track disease course, and, possibly, even monitor treatment.           The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.

"Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S.; worldwide it results in >5,000,000 premature deaths each year. The majority of smokers express a desire to quit, and each year more than half will. However, less than 7% of those who quit will achieve long-term abstinence. Much is known about the immediate and predictive antecedents of the first cigarette following a quit attempt (i.e. lapse), which include situations (e.g. presence of other smokers) and activities (e.g. alcohol consumption). While ideally this information could be used to develop a system that detects these predictive antecedents in real-time and provides just-in-time intervention; to date no such systems have been developed. The overarching goal of our research program is to develop and test such a system that uses smartphone technology. The system developed here can be incorporated into diverse application platforms that target the modification of smoking and multiple other health related behaviors including drug and alcohol use, food consumption and physical activity. Despite the fact that smoking is a known cause of death and disability, many smokers find it very difficult to quit and those who do quit often return to smoking (i.e. lapse). Although the situational factors leading up to a lapse are well documented, treatments designed to interrupt these situations before relapse occurs have not been forthcoming. Here, we propose to develop a smartphone-based system that can detect these situations in real-time.

"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.                ",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8452565,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional RNA', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2013,571955,-0.04673564882432799
"Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock regulates physiology and behavior and impinges on many aspects of our daily life. Nowhere is this more obvious than control of the sleep wake cycle, where clock genes have been shown to play a role in both the timing of sleep and its quality. For example, mutations in PER2 cause familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), while mutations in  CSNK1E and CSNK1D cause FASPS and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS),  respectively. However, while we have learned much about the clock and how it regulates sleep, the picture is incomplete. Behavioral studies in mice and studies in human cells show that dozens to hundreds of loci impact circadian clock function. However, only a dozen genes have been investigated for their roles in regulating behavior. Testing dozens to hundreds of mice isn't practical, so a new approach is needed. Here we seek to address this gap with a novel strategy that uses, i) integrative bioinformatics to prioritize putative core clock factors, ii) new experimental methods to determine whether they interact with known clock genes and regulate clock function in several cellular or tissue slice models, and, finally, iii) for a subset of promising candidates, generate mouse models and test them for their roles in regulating circadian behavior and sleep. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.             Our internal biological clocks control many important aspects of our physiology and behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Genetics and large-scale genomic studies have implicated the role of a dozen canonical and hundreds of additional new genes in the circadian clock.  However, almost none of the new genes have been studied in animal models for their ability to regulate sleep onset or quality. We will address this gap using bioinformatics, experimental biology, and finally through behavioral analysis. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities. Using a broad and interdisciplinary team of clinical and methodology scientists, this project develops advanced analytic tools that could help clinicians better understand the mechanisms of how multiple levels of risk factors lead to childhood obesity, including the relative importance of the risk factors.

"RESEARCHING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF A LOCAL METHAMPHETAMINE MARKET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates a significant feature of the socioenvironmental context of illicit drug use. Directly or indirectly, all users engage the illicit drug economy. Understanding the market roles of producers, consumers, and distributors is critical for prevention, treatment and law enforcement. However, drug markets are dynamic; they continuously adapt to internal and external forces. No theory (or methodology) exists to describe such dynamics. This five-year study develops and systematically field-tests agent-based modeling (ABM) methods to represent consumer, dealer, and health behaviors associated with the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. This approach will provide researchers with an entirely new perspective for observing outcomes of interactive behaviors, as well as the opportunity to perform experiments not possible in the real world. To program simulations, we will characterize roles, motives, behaviors, and interactions of market participants utilizing ethnographic methods (specifically, decision-tree modeling techniques). To validate and extend these data, we will collect quantitative measures of participants' daily behaviors, drug consumption, costs, and interactions using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). We will implement these techniques through a three-wave panel study (N=204); data from the panel study will characterize the sample, inform simulation parameters, and help validate simulation output. Our simulations will subsequently incorporate both descriptive ethnographic data and quantitative longitudinal data so that the behaviors of ""agents"" (simulated people interacting within the virtual market) will accurately reflect the realities of the real-world drug market. The simulation-based computer laboratory produced by this project will offer policymakers and researchers a tool for: (1) dynamically representing illicit drug market operations, (2) experimenting with agent behaviors and market parameters and conditions, and (3) evaluating ""what if"" policy scenarios intended to influence outcomes. Applying Complexity theory by systematically combining the rich detail of ethnography with ABM's power to aggregate socially complex behaviors, this project will have great practical utility. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. (2) Enrich these data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), collecting self-report data on daily drug consumption, production, sales, decisions, strategies etc. (3) Inform simulation parameters using a panel survey of 204 active methamphetamine users. (4) Construct a computer lab of ABM simulations reproducing how the local methamphetamine market operates integrating both social (i.e., health) and economic behaviors. (5) Experiment with the ABM simulations to: understand how the market operates and functions; create and test policy-based intervention scenarios (e.g. enforcement, treatment, and outreach) intended to impact outcomes; and model risk behaviors (e.g., needle sharing, trading drugs for sex) influencing the spread of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs. However, these markets are dynamic and reactive which make understanding and modeling this interaction challenging. The objective of this research is to field test a transportable, theoretically informed, and inter-disciplinary research methodology using agent-based simulation to evaluate market dynamics and their impact on methamphetamine distribution and HIV-related risk behaviors.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.           Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions.

"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children.

Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortaiity, both in the United Statesl and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem. Classic behavior change theories provide a foundation to develop and understand effective health campaigns and interventions;3 however there is still considerable variability in the effectiveness of such campaigns that we are unable to predict and explain. By improving our ability to understand and predict behavior change, neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl) may aid in the creation of maximally effective health campaigns. There may be important precursors of behavior change that are not easily obtained through self-reports, but that can be assessed with fMRl. In particular, people are notoriously limited in their ability to predict their own future  o. behavior and accurately identiy their internal mental processes through verbal and written self-report Our team has found that activity in a prioridefined neural regions of interest can double the proportion of variance explained in individual behavior change following persuasive messaging, beyond self-report measures (e.9. attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy).5'6 The current proposal posits a next leap: neuroimaging technology may also be applied to more accurately forecast population level responses to health communications, and could dramatically improve the way that we design and select health communications. To this end, we propose to: (1) identify the neurocognitive signatures of health communications that are successful at changing behavior at the population level; (2) use these maps to forecast the success of new health messages; and, (3) use the information gained about underlying mechanisms of message success to advance theory and to develop novel strategies for message design. We will employ sophisticated multivariate and machine learning data analysis techniques (e.9. reinforcement learning models and pattern classification) to characterize the neural systems that are involved in processing successful health messages (i.e. messages that ultimately facilitate behavior change in larger, independent groups). Such techniques will provide insight about the mechanisms that lead messages to be optimally effective for populations on average, as well as helping to understand heterogeneity within populations (i.e. for whom are given messages likely to be most effective). These techniques will also allow us to define models that optimally combine neuroimaging data with other available data sources (e.9. self-report). Achievement of our goals (to identify neural patterns that predict message success and to test the psychological meaning of these activations) will facilitate the design and dissemination of more effective health messages, and will allow more efficient translation of core theoretical advances across behavior and disease specific silos.    Public Health Relevance: Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, both in the United States1 and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.                  The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does.

"Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Monitoring of Stress and Social Context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is a leading preventable cause of death, responsible for one in five deaths annually in the United States alone. Many adult smokers want to or try to quit smoking, but, are unable to do so due to lack of personalized cessation treatments that ultimately leads to successful quitting. The primary hurdle has been the unavailability of technology that can be used to collect continuous measurements of stress contexts in field on predictors of abstinence and relapse. Without these measurements, it is difficult to understand the psychophysiological and biobehavioral stress mechanisms that may predict smoke lapse. This application proposes to use a new field deployable tool called AutoSense that was developed under NIH's GEI program to collect personal psychophysiological measures of stress and mediating social and environmental contexts in the natural environment of individuals to discover signatures of early relapse. AutoSense consists of several wireless sensors (e.g., ECG, respiration, triaxial accelerometer) attached to a chest band that transmit sensor measurements wirelessly to a smart phone. Fine-grained measurement of physiology enables computation of physiological measures that are predictive of stress such as minute ventilation and heart rate variability. The project uses sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate stress levels, smoking episodes and conversation episodes from physiological measurements. In addition, accelerometers are used to identify changes in posture and physical activity, and GPS measurements on the mobile phone are used to identify location and transportation modality. Seventy-two smokers who want to quit will be recruited. Two weeks prior to quit date, they will wear AutoSense for 24h in the field. Behavioral treatment for abstinence will begin in their visit to the lab prior to quitting. They wil wear AutoSense for 72h in the field, beginning on the quit date. In addition to collecting continuous measurements across all sensors, smoking and lapse events will be self-reported. Saliva samples will be collected for cortisol assessment, in addition to physiological measures of stress. Participants will report back to the lab one week after the quit date to determine smoking/lapse status. The aim of this project is to identify psychophysiological measures of stress and environmental cues that may predict early lapse. First, it will discover patterns in physiological and hormonal measures in response to withdrawal stress and acute stress that may predict lapse in the first week. Second, it will investigate the role of social and environmental context such as conversation behavior (e.g., duration and frequency of conversations), lifestyle factors (e.g., time spent in seated posture and in commuting), location (time spent at home vs. office), and indoor/outdoor status in mediating the relationship between stress and early lapse.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse. Given the adverse impact of smoking on smokers and non-smokers, such advancement will significantly improve the quality of life and reduce public health burden.              By identifying psychophysiological and biobehavioral predictors of smoking lapse and by detecting smoking cues in the natural environment, this project will enable the development and evaluation of personalized cessation interventions that can be administered in real-time on smart phones, which could prove potent in preventing relapse.

"Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S.; worldwide it results in >5,000,000 premature deaths each year. The majority of smokers express a desire to quit, and each year more than half will. However, less than 7% of those who quit will achieve long-term abstinence. Much is known about the immediate and predictive antecedents of the first cigarette following a quit attempt (i.e. lapse), which include situations (e.g. presence of other smokers) and activities (e.g. alcohol consumption). While ideally this information could be used to develop a system that detects these predictive antecedents in real-time and provides just-in-time intervention; to date no such systems have been developed. The overarching goal of our research program is to develop and test such a system that uses smartphone technology. The system developed here can be incorporated into diverse application platforms that target the modification of smoking and multiple other health related behaviors including drug and alcohol use, food consumption and physical activity. Despite the fact that smoking is a known cause of death and disability, many smokers find it very difficult to quit and those who do quit often return to smoking (i.e. lapse). Although the situational factors leading up to a lapse are well documented, treatments designed to interrupt these situations before relapse occurs have not been forthcoming. Here, we propose to develop a smartphone-based system that can detect these situations in real-time. Once developed, the sensor system can be incorporated into mobile smoking cessation applications designed to help smokers avoid relapse.",Development of a Smartphone-Based Virtual Sensor for Detecting Smoking Behavior,8402249,R21DA034471,"['Abstinence', 'Acoustics', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cotinine', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Paper', 'Physical activity', 'Probability', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Salivary', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Motion', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'drinking', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'food consumption', 'innovation', 'premature', 'programs', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'sound', 'technology development', 'technology/technique', 'therapy design', 'virtual', 'visual imagery']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2012,196250,0.004947079979032683
"Molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock regulates physiology and behavior and impinges on many aspects of our daily life. Nowhere is this more obvious than control of the sleep wake cycle, where clock genes have been shown to play a role in both the timing of sleep and its quality. For example, mutations in PER2 cause familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), while mutations in  CSNK1E and CSNK1D cause FASPS and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS),  respectively. However, while we have learned much about the clock and how it regulates sleep, the picture is incomplete. Behavioral studies in mice and studies in human cells show that dozens to hundreds of loci impact circadian clock function. However, only a dozen genes have been investigated for their roles in regulating behavior. Testing dozens to hundreds of mice isn't practical, so a new approach is needed. Here we seek to address this gap with a novel strategy that uses, i) integrative bioinformatics to prioritize putative core clock factors, ii) new experimental methods to determine whether they interact with known clock genes and regulate clock function in several cellular or tissue slice models, and, finally, iii) for a subset of promising candidates, generate mouse models and test them for their roles in regulating circadian behavior and sleep. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our internal biological clocks control many important aspects of our physiology and behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Genetics and large-scale genomic studies have implicated the role of a dozen canonical and hundreds of additional new genes in the circadian clock.  However, almost none of the new genes have been studied in animal models for their ability to regulate sleep onset or quality. We will address this gap using bioinformatics, experimental biology, and finally through behavioral analysis.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.

"RESEARCHING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF A LOCAL METHAMPHETAMINE MARKET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates a significant feature of the socioenvironmental context of illicit drug use. Directly or indirectly, all users engage the illicit drug economy. Understanding the market roles of producers, consumers, and distributors is critical for prevention, treatment and law enforcement. However, drug markets are dynamic; they continuously adapt to internal and external forces. No theory (or methodology) exists to describe such dynamics. This five-year study develops and systematically field-tests agent-based modeling (ABM) methods to represent consumer, dealer, and health behaviors associated with the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. This approach will provide researchers with an entirely new perspective for observing outcomes of interactive behaviors, as well as the opportunity to perform experiments not possible in the real world. To program simulations, we will characterize roles, motives, behaviors, and interactions of market participants utilizing ethnographic methods (specifically, decision-tree modeling techniques). To validate and extend these data, we will collect quantitative measures of participants' daily behaviors, drug consumption, costs, and interactions using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). We will implement these techniques through a three-wave panel study (N=204); data from the panel study will characterize the sample, inform simulation parameters, and help validate simulation output. Our simulations will subsequently incorporate both descriptive ethnographic data and quantitative longitudinal data so that the behaviors of ""agents"" (simulated people interacting within the virtual market) will accurately reflect the realities of the real-world drug market. The simulation-based computer laboratory produced by this project will offer policymakers and researchers a tool for: (1) dynamically representing illicit drug market operations, (2) experimenting with agent behaviors and market parameters and conditions, and (3) evaluating ""what if"" policy scenarios intended to influence outcomes. Applying Complexity theory by systematically combining the rich detail of ethnography with ABM's power to aggregate socially complex behaviors, this project will have great practical utility. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. (2) Enrich these data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), collecting self-report data on daily drug consumption, production, sales, decisions, strategies etc. (3) Inform simulation parameters using a panel survey of 204 active methamphetamine users. (4) Construct a computer lab of ABM simulations reproducing how the local methamphetamine market operates integrating both social (i.e., health) and economic behaviors. (5) Experiment with the ABM simulations to: understand how the market operates and functions; create and test policy-based intervention scenarios (e.g. enforcement, treatment, and outreach) intended to impact outcomes; and model risk behaviors (e.g., needle sharing, trading drugs for sex) influencing the spread of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs. However, these markets are dynamic and reactive which make understanding and modeling this interaction challenging. The objective of this research is to field test a transportable, theoretically informed, and inter-disciplinary research methodology using agent-based simulation to evaluate market dynamics and their impact on methamphetamine distribution and HIV-related risk behaviors.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior.

"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children.

"The Development of a Noninvasive Monitoring System for Cigarette Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking produces over 440,000 deaths each year in this country and generates an estimated $167 billion in annual health-related economic losses. Available methods of smoking assessment (e.g., self-report, portable puff-topography instruments) do not permit the collection of accurate, non-reactive measures of smoking behavior that capture real-time smoking frequency and comprehensive within-cigarette puff topography. The objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive wearable system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscience effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. Methodologically, PACT will consist of two major components: 1. Wearable sensors. Miniature sensors integrated into the clothing will monitors the breathing and activity patterns of individuals. The signals from the sensors will be processed and recognized to identify and objectively characterize each individual puff. 2. Software for signal processing and pattern recognition. Automatic computer software will analyze sensor signals and detect patterns uniquely identifying smoking events. Objective metrics such as number of puffs and inter-puff interval will be extracted. The software will be based on the state-of-art machine learning methods. The development of the PACT system will be addressed in four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a wearable sensor system comprised of a breathing sensor integrated into conventional underwear and a hand gesture sensor integrated into a hand bracelet. Specific Aim 2: Collect sensor data from individuals wearing the instrumented system and performing everyday activities (including smoking) in laboratory conditions. Specific Aim 3: Develop pattern recognition methods to recognize individual puffs and smoke inhalation. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the utility and sensitivity of the wearable sensor PACT system and pattern recognition method in people smoking in the natural environment. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of smoking behavior.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.

"Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder (RBD) refers to a condition in which patients act out their dreams and engage in potentially disruptive, injurious and even dangerous behavior while asleep[1-3]. Clinical reports of RBD have been shown to anticipate the development of neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's Disease by 20 years or more [4-6]. Despite this potential prognostic significance for human disease, the field of Sleep Medicine lacks an accepted computerized approach to quantify muscle activity in sleep. This proposed interdisciplinary research seeks to merge methods of computer engineering based computation with advanced neuroscience to establish a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to detect RBD via measurement and analysis of the phasic electromyographic activity metric (PEM). The sponsor (Bliwise) has provided evidence based on traditional visual analyses from ""expert"" scorers that PEM recorded during sleep is a sensitive indicator a) to differentiate PD patients from controls [7]; b) to distinguish non-PD patients with a history of RBD from controls [8]; and c) to differentiate PD patients with early and late stage disease [9]. These data suggest that computer-aided PEM detection within a user-friendly CDSS will be vital for clinicians to determine prognosis, track disease course, and, possibly, even monitor treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.                 The proposed work is envisioned as a vital and integral component to establish standardized computerized bio-signal processing methods to detect phasic muscle activity in overnight human sleep polysomnograms for the identification and treatment of Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder.            ",Quantitative Analysis of PEM for REMBD Identification,8203202,F32NS070572,"['Acting Out', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bypass', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dangerous Behavior', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lewy Body Disease', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized', 'computerized data processing', 'evidence base', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'rapid eye movement', 'sensor', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F32,2011,53042,0.013951924744672255
"Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a spectrum of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or levels of ventilation during sleep. The most common is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). People with OSA experience repetitive apnea (cessation of breathing) and hypopnea (marked decrease in tidal volume) during sleep in association with airway compromise and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). An arousal, or brief, often unnoticed, disruption of sleep is commonly associated with apnea. People with OSA also exhibit cognitive dysfunction, including impairment to memory, attention, and executive function. OSA- associated EDS and cognitive dysfunction are thought to significantly contribute to automobile accidents and workplace injuries. The first aim of this research is to predict the onset of nocturnal apnea, hypopnea, and arousal. Our proposal to accomplish this aim represents an entirely new approach to improving the effectiveness and tolerability of SBD therapy. The most common therapy is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which is difficult for many patients to tolerate. Existing auto-adjusting PAP may be more tolerable but relies on detection of disordered breathing events and does not appear to improve quality of life compared with conventional CPAP. Predicting these events could lead to more effective titration of PAP levels and improved outcomes. Other therapies, such as the electrical stimulation of various cranial nerves or pharyngeal muscles, could also be improved by predicting disordered breathing. The second aim is to predict the onset of unintended daytime sleep while subjects undergo maintenance of wakefulness tests, which assess one's ability to resist sleep in a soporific condition. The third aim is to predict performance lapses during driving simulations. Accomplishing aims two and three could lead to the development of warning devices for at-risk individuals. Our novel prediction algorithms track the interactions between several physiological systems and reveal the most important predictors. The fourth aim is to contrast the key predictors between OSA, acutely sleep-deprived, and control subjects, and between men and women. By doing so, we expect to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiology of SDB and EDS, and will investigate sex differences in OSA and sleep deprivation. OSA is a major public health problem whose effects on society are comparable to those of smoking. The capability to predict its adverse consequences will be an invaluable tool to improve the quality of life of people with SDB, reduce the associated costs, and improve public health          n/a",Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing,8133670,F30HL097403,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breathing', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronics', 'Environmental air flow', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Illinois', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Smoking', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Titrations', 'Universities', 'Wakefulness', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'Zebra', 'adverse outcome', 'automobile accident', 'cost', 'design', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pharynx muscle', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'sleep onset', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2011,42919,0.025152018758744003
"RESEARCHING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF A LOCAL METHAMPHETAMINE MARKET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates a significant feature of the socioenvironmental context of illicit drug use. Directly or indirectly, all users engage the illicit drug economy. Understanding the market roles of producers, consumers, and distributors is critical for prevention, treatment and law enforcement. However, drug markets are dynamic; they continuously adapt to internal and external forces. No theory (or methodology) exists to describe such dynamics. This five-year study develops and systematically field-tests agent-based modeling (ABM) methods to represent consumer, dealer, and health behaviors associated with the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. This approach will provide researchers with an entirely new perspective for observing outcomes of interactive behaviors, as well as the opportunity to perform experiments not possible in the real world. To program simulations, we will characterize roles, motives, behaviors, and interactions of market participants utilizing ethnographic methods (specifically, decision-tree modeling techniques). To validate and extend these data, we will collect quantitative measures of participants' daily behaviors, drug consumption, costs, and interactions using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). We will implement these techniques through a three-wave panel study (N=204); data from the panel study will characterize the sample, inform simulation parameters, and help validate simulation output. Our simulations will subsequently incorporate both descriptive ethnographic data and quantitative longitudinal data so that the behaviors of ""agents"" (simulated people interacting within the virtual market) will accurately reflect the realities of the real-world drug market. The simulation-based computer laboratory produced by this project will offer policymakers and researchers a tool for: (1) dynamically representing illicit drug market operations, (2) experimenting with agent behaviors and market parameters and conditions, and (3) evaluating ""what if"" policy scenarios intended to influence outcomes. Applying Complexity theory by systematically combining the rich detail of ethnography with ABM's power to aggregate socially complex behaviors, this project will have great practical utility. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. (2) Enrich these data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), collecting self-report data on daily drug consumption, production, sales, decisions, strategies etc. (3) Inform simulation parameters using a panel survey of 204 active methamphetamine users. (4) Construct a computer lab of ABM simulations reproducing how the local methamphetamine market operates integrating both social (i.e., health) and economic behaviors. (5) Experiment with the ABM simulations to: understand how the market operates and functions; create and test policy-based intervention scenarios (e.g. enforcement, treatment, and outreach) intended to impact outcomes; and model risk behaviors (e.g., needle sharing, trading drugs for sex) influencing the spread of HIV.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities.

The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors.

"Longitudinal validity of accelerometry in youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the inception of parent grant (July 2007), pattern recognition approaches such as neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, and hidden Markov models have emerged as a viable and potentially more accurate alternative to traditional regression based cut-point methods. Whereas cut-point methods have proven to be modestly useful for broadly classifying the absolute intensity of physical activity, preliminary findings from the parent grant suggest that regression-based cut-point methods lack the accuracy required to provide valid point estimates of total and physical activity energy expenditure in field-based studies. Recently, pattern recognition approaches have been shown to be feasible and accurate using count data collected in 1-second increments by the widely used Actigraph accelerometer. The overarching goal of this competitive revision is to apply novel pattern recognition or machine learning data processing techniques to estimate physical activity type and intensity from high resolution accelerometer count data collected in children and adolescents as part of the ongoing parent grant. The proposed new aims are as follows: 1) To formulate and apply pattern recognition data processing techniques (multivariate hidden Markov models) to predict physical activity type and intensity from 1-second accelerometer count data collected in an age-diverse cohort children and adolescent; and 2) to compare the accuracy of physical activity intensity predictions provided by pattern recognition data processing techniques and traditional regression-based cut-point methods at baseline, and after 12-, 24-, and 36-months of follow-up.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents. Moreover, the new aims will inform the development of new computational approaches for predicting physical activity energy expenditure in free-living children and adolescents. This development will be particularly important for observational and experimental studies wishing to investigate the contributions of physical activity and sedentary behavior in the development and maintenance of childhood obesity.                Relevance to Public Health The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents.

"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children.

"The Development of a Noninvasive Monitoring System for Cigarette Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking produces over 440,000 deaths each year in this country and generates an estimated $167 billion in annual health-related economic losses. Available methods of smoking assessment (e.g., self-report, portable puff-topography instruments) do not permit the collection of accurate, non-reactive measures of smoking behavior that capture real-time smoking frequency and comprehensive within-cigarette puff topography. The objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive wearable system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscience effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. Methodologically, PACT will consist of two major components: 1. Wearable sensors. Miniature sensors integrated into the clothing will monitors the breathing and activity patterns of individuals. The signals from the sensors will be processed and recognized to identify and objectively characterize each individual puff. 2. Software for signal processing and pattern recognition. Automatic computer software will analyze sensor signals and detect patterns uniquely identifying smoking events. Objective metrics such as number of puffs and inter-puff interval will be extracted. The software will be based on the state-of-art machine learning methods. The development of the PACT system will be addressed in four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a wearable sensor system comprised of a breathing sensor integrated into conventional underwear and a hand gesture sensor integrated into a hand bracelet. Specific Aim 2: Collect sensor data from individuals wearing the instrumented system and performing everyday activities (including smoking) in laboratory conditions. Specific Aim 3: Develop pattern recognition methods to recognize individual puffs and smoke inhalation. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the utility and sensitivity of the wearable sensor PACT system and pattern recognition method in people smoking in the natural environment. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of smoking behavior.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.

"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use. The resulting data processing programs will be implemented in popular commercial software packages and made freely available. The results of the proposed investigations will move the field of PA assessment forward by providing innovative approaches to derive more accurate and detailed estimates of PA using a popular accelerometer-based PA monitor. This systematic approach will provide information leading to a clearer understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health and the physiological basis of this relationship.           n/a",Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity,7825424,R01CA121005,"['Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Health', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutritional epidemiology', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'trend']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2010,185505,0.05267644484379468
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          n/a",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7895863,U01HL091737,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asia', 'Car Phone', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical activity scale', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shoes', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Sports', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cost', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'open source', 'prototype', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'social', 'software development', 'software systems']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2010,534121,0.034361768911019566
"Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a spectrum of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or levels of ventilation during sleep. The most common is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). People with OSA experience repetitive apnea (cessation of breathing) and hypopnea (marked decrease in tidal volume) during sleep in association with airway compromise and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). An arousal, or brief, often unnoticed, disruption of sleep is commonly associated with apnea. People with OSA also exhibit cognitive dysfunction, including impairment to memory, attention, and executive function. OSA- associated EDS and cognitive dysfunction are thought to significantly contribute to automobile accidents and workplace injuries. The first aim of this research is to predict the onset of nocturnal apnea, hypopnea, and arousal. Our proposal to accomplish this aim represents an entirely new approach to improving the effectiveness and tolerability of SBD therapy. The most common therapy is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which is difficult for many patients to tolerate. Existing auto-adjusting PAP may be more tolerable but relies on detection of disordered breathing events and does not appear to improve quality of life compared with conventional CPAP. Predicting these events could lead to more effective titration of PAP levels and improved outcomes. Other therapies, such as the electrical stimulation of various cranial nerves or pharyngeal muscles, could also be improved by predicting disordered breathing. The second aim is to predict the onset of unintended daytime sleep while subjects undergo maintenance of wakefulness tests, which assess one's ability to resist sleep in a soporific condition. The third aim is to predict performance lapses during driving simulations. Accomplishing aims two and three could lead to the development of warning devices for at-risk individuals. Our novel prediction algorithms track the interactions between several physiological systems and reveal the most important predictors. The fourth aim is to contrast the key predictors between OSA, acutely sleep-deprived, and control subjects, and between men and women. By doing so, we expect to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiology of SDB and EDS, and will investigate sex differences in OSA and sleep deprivation. OSA is a major public health problem whose effects on society are comparable to those of smoking.

In October, 2008 the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first-ever federally mandated Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The Guidelines reflect the view of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) and are based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on physical activity (PA) and health. In their report, the PAGAC points out the limited knowledge of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, and identifies poor measures of PA exposure as a major contributing factor to this gap in knowledge. Our application directly addresses this issue by applying innovative technologies to measure PA dose in a free- living environment. We will use these technologies to examine if habitual PA performed outside of purposeful exercise influences biomarkers of cardiovascular health. Although insufficient PA clearly correlates with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), research evidence is equivocal regarding the effects of training on CVD risk factors (e.g. insulin action, triglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol). Research suggests increases in sedentary behavior may negate the benefits of training however this idea has not been explored experimentally. Our application will consider habitual free-living PA as a possible mechanism mediating the relationship between training and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the relationship between PA and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, it is critical that valid, objective measures are used to quantify PA. We propose to use novel analytic techniques known as artificial neural networks (ANN) to process accelerometer-based measurements of PA. The first part of this project (Aim 1) will examine the ANN's sensitivity to change in PA dose by applying the ANN technique to distinguish three distinct patterns of habitual PA - Sedentary, Moderately Active, and Very Active. These three conditions represent common activity patterns that impact health. Accurately assessing changes to habitual PA levels that are relevant to public health will advance the field by further establishing a technique for application in population surveillance research and detection of changes in PA consequent to an intervention. The second part of this project (Aim 2) will apply the ANN methodology to examine the effect of free-living activity and inactivity levels, performed outside of training, on insulin action, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 12-week exercise training trial in previously sedentary individuals with an elevated risk for CVD. Results from this study have the potential to impact how clinical exercise trials are conducted (e.g. require objective monitoring of PA outside of an exercise training trial) and how exercise is prescribed (e.g. reducing sedentary time AND maintaining sufficient PA). The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health. To address this challenge we will apply and validate innovative accelerometer-based technologies for measuring physical activity to assess its sensitivity to detecting changes in dose of physical activity and to monitor activity outside of a training program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Through improved measures of physical activity this project will promote a better understanding of how the dose of physical activity affects selected health outcomes.                  Project Narrative The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health.

"Measuring real time decision-making about UVR Protection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of interventions to maximize consistency in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) protection rests on improved understanding of decision-making factors that contribute to daily variation in UVR protection. In this study, we use Ethnographic Decision Tree Modeling to examine decision-making regarding sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and UVR protection behavior in melanoma first-degree relatives (FDRs). In Phase I, we will generate the models via qualitative ethnographic interviews with 25 melanoma FDRs, and then will construct a composite decision-making model for each of the three UVR protection outcomes. In Phase II we will establish the validity of the models using ecological momentary assessment of UVR protection (over 14 summer days, at 1 pm and 5 pm daily) in 60 FDRs. We will recruit equal numbers of women and men, and equal numbers of those who perceive high and low advantages of tanning, given the importance of these predictors for UVR protection. Specific Aim I is to generate and establish the validity of the models explaining decision-making about three UVR protection behaviors (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, use of protective clothing) in melanoma FDRs, and Specific Aim II is to examine theory-driven affective and cognitive predictors of sun protection maintenance (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and use of sun protective clothing) assessed in real time. We adopt a theory-informed approach to decision-making, and so expect that the factors identified inductively in Phase I, as well as between- and within-subject variation in melanoma threat, efficacy beliefs, and satisfaction with UVR protection drawn from Witte's Extended Parallel Processing Model and Rothman's theory of health behavior maintenance will predict UVR protection behaviors. We will also examine gender and tanning attitudes as covariates of these effects. The study findings will increase our understanding of the decision- making context for behavioral maintenance of UVR protection, and dictate novel intervention strategies to reduce behavioral inconsistency - and increase behavioral maintenance - of UVR protection in those at high risk for melanoma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives. We will employ qualitative and quantitative research strategies and determine between and within- person variability in UVR protection and decision-making that will inform the development of interventions to increase UVR protection maintenance among those who are at risk for melanoma.                    Narrative This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities. Using a broad and interdisciplinary team of clinical and methodology scientists, this project develops advanced analytic tools that could help clinicians better understand the mechanisms of how multiple levels of risk factors lead to childhood obesity, including the relative importance of the risk factors.              Project Narrative As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities.

"RESEARCHING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF A LOCAL METHAMPHETAMINE MARKET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates a significant feature of the socioenvironmental context of illicit drug use. Directly or indirectly, all users engage the illicit drug economy. Understanding the market roles of producers, consumers, and distributors is critical for prevention, treatment and law enforcement. However, drug markets are dynamic; they continuously adapt to internal and external forces. No theory (or methodology) exists to describe such dynamics. This five-year study develops and systematically field-tests agent-based modeling (ABM) methods to represent consumer, dealer, and health behaviors associated with the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. This approach will provide researchers with an entirely new perspective for observing outcomes of interactive behaviors, as well as the opportunity to perform experiments not possible in the real world. To program simulations, we will characterize roles, motives, behaviors, and interactions of market participants utilizing ethnographic methods (specifically, decision-tree modeling techniques). To validate and extend these data, we will collect quantitative measures of participants' daily behaviors, drug consumption, costs, and interactions using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). We will implement these techniques through a three-wave panel study (N=204); data from the panel study will characterize the sample, inform simulation parameters, and help validate simulation output. Our simulations will subsequently incorporate both descriptive ethnographic data and quantitative longitudinal data so that the behaviors of ""agents"" (simulated people interacting within the virtual market) will accurately reflect the realities of the real-world drug market. The simulation-based computer laboratory produced by this project will offer policymakers and researchers a tool for: (1) dynamically representing illicit drug market operations, (2) experimenting with agent behaviors and market parameters and conditions, and (3) evaluating ""what if"" policy scenarios intended to influence outcomes. Applying Complexity theory by systematically combining the rich detail of ethnography with ABM's power to aggregate socially complex behaviors, this project will have great practical utility. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. (2) Enrich these data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), collecting self-report data on daily drug consumption, production, sales, decisions, strategies etc. (3) Inform simulation parameters using a panel survey of 204 active methamphetamine users. (4) Construct a computer lab of ABM simulations reproducing how the local methamphetamine market operates integrating both social (i.e., health) and economic behaviors. (5) Experiment with the ABM simulations to: understand how the market operates and functions; create and test policy-based intervention scenarios (e.g. enforcement, treatment, and outreach) intended to impact outcomes; and model risk behaviors (e.g., needle sharing, trading drugs for sex) influencing the spread of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs. However, these markets are dynamic and reactive which make understanding and modeling this interaction challenging. The objective of this research is to field test a transportable, theoretically informed, and inter-disciplinary research methodology using agent-based simulation to evaluate market dynamics and their impact on methamphetamine distribution and HIV-related risk behaviors.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs.

"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use.

"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users.

"Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a spectrum of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or levels of ventilation during sleep. The most common is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). People with OSA experience repetitive apnea (cessation of breathing) and hypopnea (marked decrease in tidal volume) during sleep in association with airway compromise and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). An arousal, or brief, often unnoticed, disruption of sleep is commonly associated with apnea. People with OSA also exhibit cognitive dysfunction, including impairment to memory, attention, and executive function. OSA- associated EDS and cognitive dysfunction are thought to significantly contribute to automobile accidents and workplace injuries. The first aim of this research is to predict the onset of nocturnal apnea, hypopnea, and arousal. Our proposal to accomplish this aim represents an entirely new approach to improving the effectiveness and tolerability of SBD therapy. The most common therapy is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which is difficult for many patients to tolerate. Existing auto-adjusting PAP may be more tolerable but relies on detection of disordered breathing events and does not appear to improve quality of life compared with conventional CPAP. Predicting these events could lead to more effective titration of PAP levels and improved outcomes. Other therapies, such as the electrical stimulation of various cranial nerves or pharyngeal muscles, could also be improved by predicting disordered breathing. The second aim is to predict the onset of unintended daytime sleep while subjects undergo maintenance of wakefulness tests, which assess one's ability to resist sleep in a soporific condition. The third aim is to predict performance lapses during driving simulations. Accomplishing aims two and three could lead to the development of warning devices for at-risk individuals. Our novel prediction algorithms track the interactions between several physiological systems and reveal the most important predictors. The fourth aim is to contrast the key predictors between OSA, acutely sleep-deprived, and control subjects, and between men and women. By doing so, we expect to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiology of SDB and EDS, and will investigate sex differences in OSA and sleep deprivation. OSA is a major public health problem whose effects on society are comparable to those of smoking. The capability to predict its adverse consequences will be an invaluable tool to improve the quality of life of people with SDB, reduce the associated costs, and improve public health          n/a",Prediction of Physiological Events in People with Sleep Disordered Breathing,7745752,F30HL097403,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breathing', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronics', 'Environmental air flow', 'Event', 'Excessive Daytime Sleepiness', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Illinois', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Smoking', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Titrations', 'Universities', 'Wakefulness', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'Zebra', 'automobile accident', 'cost', 'design', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pharynx muscle', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'sleep onset', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2009,42295,0.025152018758744003
"Advancing Physical Activity Measurement Using Pattern Recognition Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Area 01-HL-101: Develop innovative technologies and measurements to assess and provide real-time feedback on behavioral and environmental exposures for disease onset and progression for heart, lung, and blood disease. In October, 2008 the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first-ever federally mandated Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The Guidelines reflect the view of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) and are based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on physical activity (PA) and health. In their report, the PAGAC points out the limited knowledge of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, and identifies poor measures of PA exposure as a major contributing factor to this gap in knowledge. Our application directly addresses this issue by applying innovative technologies to measure PA dose in a free- living environment. We will use these technologies to examine if habitual PA performed outside of purposeful exercise influences biomarkers of cardiovascular health. Although insufficient PA clearly correlates with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), research evidence is equivocal regarding the effects of training on CVD risk factors (e.g. insulin action, triglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol). Research suggests increases in sedentary behavior may negate the benefits of training however this idea has not been explored experimentally. Our application will consider habitual free-living PA as a possible mechanism mediating the relationship between training and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the relationship between PA and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, it is critical that valid, objective measures are used to quantify PA. We propose to use novel analytic techniques known as artificial neural networks (ANN) to process accelerometer-based measurements of PA. The first part of this project (Aim 1) will examine the ANN's sensitivity to change in PA dose by applying the ANN technique to distinguish three distinct patterns of habitual PA - Sedentary, Moderately Active, and Very Active. These three conditions represent common activity patterns that impact health. Accurately assessing changes to habitual PA levels that are relevant to public health will advance the field by further establishing a technique for application in population surveillance research and detection of changes in PA consequent to an intervention. The second part of this project (Aim 2) will apply the ANN methodology to examine the effect of free-living activity and inactivity levels, performed outside of training, on insulin action, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 12-week exercise training trial in previously sedentary individuals with an elevated risk for CVD. Results from this study have the potential to impact how clinical exercise trials are conducted (e.g. require objective monitoring of PA outside of an exercise training trial) and how exercise is prescribed (e.g. reducing sedentary time AND maintaining sufficient PA). The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health. To address this challenge we will apply and validate innovative accelerometer-based technologies for measuring physical activity to assess its sensitivity to detecting changes in dose of physical activity and to monitor activity outside of a training program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Through improved measures of physical activity this project will promote a better understanding of how the dose of physical activity affects selected health outcomes.                  Project Narrative The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health.

"Measuring real time decision-making about UVR Protection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of interventions to maximize consistency in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) protection rests on improved understanding of decision-making factors that contribute to daily variation in UVR protection. In this study, we use Ethnographic Decision Tree Modeling to examine decision-making regarding sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and UVR protection behavior in melanoma first-degree relatives (FDRs). In Phase I, we will generate the models via qualitative ethnographic interviews with 25 melanoma FDRs, and then will construct a composite decision-making model for each of the three UVR protection outcomes. In Phase II we will establish the validity of the models using ecological momentary assessment of UVR protection (over 14 summer days, at 1 pm and 5 pm daily) in 60 FDRs. We will recruit equal numbers of women and men, and equal numbers of those who perceive high and low advantages of tanning, given the importance of these predictors for UVR protection. Specific Aim I is to generate and establish the validity of the models explaining decision-making about three UVR protection behaviors (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, use of protective clothing) in melanoma FDRs, and Specific Aim II is to examine theory-driven affective and cognitive predictors of sun protection maintenance (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and use of sun protective clothing) assessed in real time. We adopt a theory-informed approach to decision-making, and so expect that the factors identified inductively in Phase I, as well as between- and within-subject variation in melanoma threat, efficacy beliefs, and satisfaction with UVR protection drawn from Witte's Extended Parallel Processing Model and Rothman's theory of health behavior maintenance will predict UVR protection behaviors. We will also examine gender and tanning attitudes as covariates of these effects. The study findings will increase our understanding of the decision- making context for behavioral maintenance of UVR protection, and dictate novel intervention strategies to reduce behavioral inconsistency - and increase behavioral maintenance - of UVR protection in those at high risk for melanoma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives. We will employ qualitative and quantitative research strategies and determine between and within- person variability in UVR protection and decision-making that will inform the development of interventions to increase UVR protection maintenance among those who are at risk for melanoma.                    Narrative This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives.

"RESEARCHING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF A LOCAL METHAMPHETAMINE MARKET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project investigates a significant feature of the socioenvironmental context of illicit drug use. Directly or indirectly, all users engage the illicit drug economy. Understanding the market roles of producers, consumers, and distributors is critical for prevention, treatment and law enforcement. However, drug markets are dynamic; they continuously adapt to internal and external forces. No theory (or methodology) exists to describe such dynamics. This five-year study develops and systematically field-tests agent-based modeling (ABM) methods to represent consumer, dealer, and health behaviors associated with the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. This approach will provide researchers with an entirely new perspective for observing outcomes of interactive behaviors, as well as the opportunity to perform experiments not possible in the real world. To program simulations, we will characterize roles, motives, behaviors, and interactions of market participants utilizing ethnographic methods (specifically, decision-tree modeling techniques). To validate and extend these data, we will collect quantitative measures of participants' daily behaviors, drug consumption, costs, and interactions using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). We will implement these techniques through a three-wave panel study (N=204); data from the panel study will characterize the sample, inform simulation parameters, and help validate simulation output. Our simulations will subsequently incorporate both descriptive ethnographic data and quantitative longitudinal data so that the behaviors of ""agents"" (simulated people interacting within the virtual market) will accurately reflect the realities of the real-world drug market. The simulation-based computer laboratory produced by this project will offer policymakers and researchers a tool for: (1) dynamically representing illicit drug market operations, (2) experimenting with agent behaviors and market parameters and conditions, and (3) evaluating ""what if"" policy scenarios intended to influence outcomes. Applying Complexity theory by systematically combining the rich detail of ethnography with ABM's power to aggregate socially complex behaviors, this project will have great practical utility. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the methamphetamine market in Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, OH. (2) Enrich these data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), collecting self-report data on daily drug consumption, production, sales, decisions, strategies etc. (3) Inform simulation parameters using a panel survey of 204 active methamphetamine users. (4) Construct a computer lab of ABM simulations reproducing how the local methamphetamine market operates integrating both social (i.e., health) and economic behaviors. (5) Experiment with the ABM simulations to: understand how the market operates and functions; create and test policy-based intervention scenarios (e.g. enforcement, treatment, and outreach) intended to impact outcomes; and model risk behaviors (e.g., needle sharing, trading drugs for sex) influencing the spread of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs. However, these markets are dynamic and reactive which make understanding and modeling this interaction challenging. The objective of this research is to field test a transportable, theoretically informed, and inter-disciplinary research methodology using agent-based simulation to evaluate market dynamics and their impact on methamphetamine distribution and HIV-related risk behaviors.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug users risk behaviors are influenced by the markets in which they acquire drugs.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat!

"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users.

"Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior Abstract Free-living cells display strong genome-wide transcriptional responses to changes in individual environmental parameters such as oxygen and temperature. Such transcriptional dynamics are thought to be the basis of a homeostatic response that attempts to reverse the immediate intracellular consequences resulting from the specific change in the environment. I present an alternative interpretation where transcriptional responses reflect a multifaceted behavioral program in response to global changes in the environment that are anticipated to follow the perturbation. This results from the fact that native microbial habitats are highly structured, giving rise to strong correlations between environmental parameters. Over geological timescales, such correlations can be internalized through an ""associative learning"" process that shapes the connectivity and dynamics of regulatory networks. Such internal models should allow microbes to predict the future trajectory of the environment based on immediate sensory information. We have seen evidence of this anticipatory behavior in responses of the bacterium Escherichia coli to changes in temperature and oxygen that correspond to transitions between the outside environment and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. These internal representations seem to reflect a true associative learning paradigm, since they show plasticity upon exposure to novel environments. These phenomena increasingly demand that we interpret microbial behaviors from a cognitive perspective, much as we do for understanding animal behaviors. I propose a multi-faceted research program aimed at 1) establishing that these phenomena, indeed, represent cognitive modeling of microbial habitats, 2) revealing the underlying network mechanisms, and 3) exploring associative learning of novel environments through laboratory experimental evolution. The proposed work establishes deep connections between the disparate fields of microbial ecology, regulatory network evolution, and behavior. In so doing, it challenges the dominance of the century-old notion of homeostasis, with fundamental implications for how we understand and control microbial behavior, especially in the context of disease. n/a",Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior,7555864,DP1OD003787,"['Acidity', 'Acids', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteroides fragilis', 'Base Pairing', 'Basic Science', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Carbon', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotaxis', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Cytochromes', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Depth', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Drops', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Global Change', 'Growth', 'Habitats', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Homo', 'Human', 'Hybridization Array', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Physiology', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Detection', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'New York', 'Nitrogen', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Output', 'Oxidases', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Perception', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Psychological Manipulation', 'Psychology', 'Pulse taking', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Salts', 'Science', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'day', 'density', 'design', 'electron donor', 'enteric pathogen', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'microbial', 'microbial disease', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'null mutation', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'quorum sensing', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",OD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,DP1,2008,805000,-0.008879140626521533

"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.

"Elective Surgery as a Teachable Moment for Smoking Cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The term ""teachable moment"" refers to an event that motivates individuals to spontaneously adopt risk- reducing health behaviors. Events such as the diagnosis of smoking-related illnesses (e.g. cancer) and the scheduling of surgery spontaneously (i.e., in the absence of interventions) increase the rate of quitting. However, as recently discussed in an important conceptual paper by McBride et al, little is known about factors that make certain cueing events ""teachable"". They proposed a heuristic in which an event is a ""teachable moment"" for smoking cessation to the extent that it impacts 3 key constructs. Although appealing in concept, its validity has not been evaluated. The scheduling of surgery provides a unique opportunity to test the McBride model. This study will evaluate the McBride heuristic as applied to smoking behavior following elective surgical procedures. Two specific aims will be pursued. In the first we will develop measures of the Me Bride model specific to the surgical setting, and perform an initial evaluation of their stability and internal consistency in a group of surgical patients. In the second, we will perform a pilot study to explore the hypothesis that in patients scheduled for elective surgery: 1) higher perceptions of risks or greater negative expectancies regarding health outcomes related to smoking, 2) higher levels of positive or negative affective responses, and 3) self-concept or role expectations related to smoking will correlate with measures of self-efficacy and intent, and predict postoperative abstinence from smoking. Measures of the McBride constructs will be administered to smokers scheduled for elective surgery, whose smoking behavior will be evaluated for up to 30 days postoperatively. Structural equation modeling will be utilized both to validate the measurement model established in Aim 1 and to test the fit of the structural model associated with the McBride heuristic to postoperative smoking behavior. Relevance to public health: Evaluation of the McBride heuristic is of interest not only from a theoretical standpoint, but may have practical implications regarding the design of behavioral interventions to exploit the ""teachable moment. For example, if the constructs predict behavior, interventions can attempt to specifically influence these constructs. Our overall goal is to develop effective tobacco use interventions for surgical patients; this project will be an important step in this process.           n/a",Elective Surgery as a Teachable Moment for Smoking Cessation,7226537,R03CA126371,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior', 'clinical research', 'health', 'model', 'smoking', 'smoking cessation', 'surgery']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC,R03,2006,74000,0.03674351411647373
"Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary lifestyle is directly associated with disease and reduced quality of life. While the general United States population is suffering from an epidemic of sedentary lifestyle, Latinos are even more sedentary than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Notably, Latinos suffer from greater rates of morbidity and mortality of conditions associated with being sedentary than non-Hispanic whites. One concern is that due to cultural artifacts, socioeconomic circumstances, and language barriers, Latinos have limited access to public health interventions that promote active lifestyles. Modern behavioral informatics interventions that use theory-based computer-run expert systems show great promise to provide more effective interventions for hard-to-reach populations at lower cost. The present application is in response to PA-04-153, 'Health Disparities Among Minority and Underserved Women.' We aim to both culturally and linguistically modify an evidence-based, inidvidually tailored intervention, founded on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, to target sedentary Latinas. This print-based, expert system intervention has been developed and tested by Dr. Bess Marcus and her team, who have spent 18 years developing programs to increase physical activity in sedentary adults. The study will involve two phases: 1) a formative research period in which 100 Latinas will be recruited to provide data on how to modify the current tailored intervention to be culturally congruent and 2) a pilot randomized trial with 80 recruited Latinas to test the modified intervention against off-the-shelf bilingual health educational materials for Latinas. The formative research phase will involve an iterative process of qualitative data collection and intervention modification, with: 1) translation from English to Spanish; 2) an initial round of exploratory focus groups to obtain data on unique themes to include in the modified intervention; 3) a second round of confirmatory focus groups to examine responses to modified intervention materials; and 4) a series of intensive individual cognitive interviews to examine readability and comprehension, consistency of perception of materials with theory, and conceptual integrity of the intervention materials across English and Spanish. The pilot study will provide data on feasibility as well as on effect size of the modified intervention to inform a future clinical trial. Secondary analyses will explore differences in intervention effect based on levels of acculturation and of ethnic identity.             n/a",Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas,7197865,R21NR009864,"['Hispanic Americans', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'focus groups', 'lifestyle', 'public health']",NINR,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R21,2006,210300,0.0024491572491461043
"HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af. Am. Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiological evidence indicates that the risk of contracting HIV is increasing among African American young adults living in the rural South. African American communities in rural Georgia are characterized by chronic unemployment and poverty along with a dearth of health and educational resources. Young adults in these communities face significant barriers to adequate employment and higher education. Many respond to this lack of opportunity and the resulting economic pressure by engaging in high-risk behavior, including substance use and unprotected sexual activity. Although young adults attending higher education have been studied extensively, barriers to obtaining valid samples have prevented empirical research on the risk and protective factors that affect rural African American young adults who do not attend college. The research proposed in this R-21 application addresses the public health need to develop new approaches to obtaining valid samples of hard-to-reach members of populations at risk for HIV and substance use and to identify the protective factors that dissuade them from engaging in high risk behaviors. The objectives of this study are to (1) test the feasibility of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) for obtaining a sample of rural African American young adults age 18-21 who are out of school and living in resource- poor, rural environments, and (2) evaluate a model of the personal, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors that explain high-risk sexual behavior among these young people. RDS is a novel technique that combines ""snowball sampling"" with a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for its non-random nature. RDS will be used to obtain a sample of 240 rural African American young adults. Data will be gathered to evaluate a heuristic model that includes the following predictors: socioeconomic and personal stressors; the negative emotions these stressors induce; support and socialization from prosocial adults; intrapersonal protective processes, including a future orientation, self-regulation, emotion regulation, and racial identity; affiliations with risk-taking peers and sexual partners; and antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior, such as behavioral intentions and attitudes toward sexually protective behaviors.           n/a",HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af.

"An Intelligent Physical Activity Monitor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a recognized need for specific and reliable information regarding the dose/response relationships between physical activity and health for all segments of the population. New methods for assessing physical activity and energy expenditure (EE) in free-living populations are needed before a systematic evaluation and interpretation of these dose-response relationships between physical activity and specific health-related results can be undertaken. Our objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, unobtrusive acceleration pattern acquisition and analysis system. This instrument will identify and quantify the physical activities that generate these patterns. At the end of this program, we will provide an intelligent system that is practical from both a cost and unobtrusive use prospective, thus making it an instrument of choice for epidemiologic physical activity studies of large free-living populations.           n/a",An Intelligent Physical Activity Monitor,7107376,R43HD051014,"['actigraphy', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'body movement', 'body physical activity', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'computer system hardware', 'cost effectiveness', 'exercise', 'human subject', 'microprocessor /microchip', 'miniature biomedical equipment', 'oxygen consumption', 'patient monitoring device', 'personal log /diary', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'telemetry', 'videotape /videodisc']",NICHD,"CREARE, INC.",R43,2006,122046,0.04412220048427801
"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects.

The system will be designed to be worn and used continuously by free-living populations and provide users with health behavior change information at the moment it is needed.      Users will interact with the PDA via a simulated face-to-face conversation with the animated relational agent, and will conduct a daily progress review and goal-setting session at which time they will schedule specific times they intend to walk on the following day (bouts of 10 minutes or more of moderate or greater intensity). If they complete a scheduled walk, the agent provides immediate social reinforcement. If they fail to initiate a walk at a scheduled time the agent engages them in a problem-solving session in which it attempts to help them overcome the specific obstacle to exercise they are experiencing.       In the proposed effort the components of the PDA-based system will be developed, integrated and tested, and a randomized pilot study conducted to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of the PDA-based behavior change intervention for increasing walking; 2) evaluate the effect of timeliness of health behavior change information on walking (time of need vs. retrospective); and 3) compare the efficacy of the personified user interface with that of a text-based interface for delivering health behavior change information on a PDA.

"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events.

"Novel Real-Time Algorithms:Quantifying Wake-Sleep States The overall goal of this project is to develop and clinically validate a novel class of computerized EEG-based algorithms and sophisticated signal processing methods designed for high temporal resolution characterization of the wake-sleep transition and fluctuations within sleep stages. In addition to their capability of profiling wakefulness and various sleep stages as a continuous process, these algorithms will be developed in a format such that they can be eventually implemented for real-time detection of wake-to sleep transitions. The new approach of this proposal is based on an innovative interaction of classically independent signal processing methods for quantifying EEG, including traditional Short-Term Fourier Transform, Recursive Auto-regressive Parameter Estimation, and Wavelet analysis. This new approach takes advantage of each method's relative strength and ""fuses"" the information obtained from each technique to provide a means of quantifying the entire wake-sleep transition with high temporal resolution (e.g., early detection of sleep onset) while being robust to factors that normally degrade EEG processing. The developed algorithms will be validated with an extensive set of clinical data including nocturnal polysomnography, and day-time tests of Sleepiness, MSLT (Multiple Sleep Latency Test) and MWT (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test). The dynamic events detected by these algorithms (e.g., micro-arousals and micro-sleeps) will be evaluated against standard R&K scoring of the same EEG data. Furthermore, the profile and characteristics of the events detected in PSG will be correlated with the daytime objective and subjective tests of sleepiness. n/a",Novel Real-Time Algorithms:Quantifying Wake-Sleep States,6838292,R43HL078442,"['arousal', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electroencephalography', 'human subject', 'mathematics', 'polysomnography', 'sleep', 'wakefulness']",NHLBI,"CLEVELAND MEDICAL DEVICES, INC.",R43,2004,176785,0.02027366272416582

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology.

"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events.

"Smoking Cessation Coach--An Internet Tailoring Program Smoking is the number one health problem faced by the world today. Computers have increasingly been evaluated as a method to deliver smoking cessation self-help messages. Individually tailored printed reports generated by computers have been effective at encouraging smokers at various levels of motivation to change. The programs studied are limited in two areas: 1) the systems studied in controlled trials are primarily limited to a self-help approach and have not been integrated into physician-patient interactions and 2) previous systems have not taken full advantage of the accessibility and interactivity made available through the Internet revolution. A large body of evidence substantiates the effectiveness of physician counseling, an underutilized intervention, on smoking cessation. One paradigm that has been proven to be successful for other medical conditions but has not been applied to expert systems for smoking cessation is the model of pre-visit coaching. ""Patient activation"" as it is known has the capacity to encourage patients to ask questions and seek physician advice. AIM 1. To explore potential methods of incorporating concepts of patient activation and social networking into an existing evidence-based primary care smoking cessation computer program to: 1) provide individual assessment and tailored feedback to encourage cessation; 2) coach patients about how to talk with their physician about smoking cessation; and 3) help users enlist the support of others around them as they try to quit smoking. AIM 2. To design and implement an Internet-based smoking cessation system (Smoking Cessation Coach) based on concepts identified and refined in AIM 1. AIM 3. To complete a series of three small pilot studies to: 1) explore patient provider interaction after an individual completes the Smoking Cessation Coach; 2) explore what the characteristics of smokers who do and do not actually access the site with the Smoking Cessation Coach after being informed of the program at a primary care office; and 3) measure the prevalence of use and perceived value of the Smoking Cessation Coach after four weeks of follow-up among a cohort of individuals recruited from the Internet. At the completion of the two years for this grant we will have developed and completed pilot testing of an internet-based smoking cessation program that will build on the skills of physicians and others who interact with the individual trying to stop smoking on a daily basis. Such a program has a high potential of reaching a large number of smokers. The plan will be to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Smoking Cessation Coach in the next study.  n/a",Smoking Cessation Coach--An Internet Tailoring Program,6514798,R21CA089011,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' education evaluation /planning', ' human subject', ' patient care personnel relations', ' questionnaires', ' smoking cessation', ' social support network', ' substance abuse related behavior', ' tobacco abuse education']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2002,163500,0.03399407076781708

"PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This application was            initially submitted as an R29 FIRST Award, and is being re-submitted as an R01       in response to Program Announcement, PA-97-065 (NIA) entitled, ""Social               Cognition and Aging.""                                                                 The goal of this project is to determine how individual risk perceptions             influence health behaviors among the near-elderly (51-61) and decisions              regarding wealth holdings among the elderly (70+). Among the near-elderly, the       following health behaviors will be studied: the use of preventive services           (mammography, prostate screening, and cholesterol screening), weight loss and        exercise. The preventive services are designed to reduce mortality from cancer       and heart disease. Weight loss and exercise are both preventive measures as          well as mitigators of harm that results from health shocks. Expanding the use        of these preventive and mitigating measures are important to reduce morbidity        and mortality from heart disease and cancer. Among the elderly, the behavior of      interest relates to asset accumulation/dissaving, specifically focusing on           housing decisions. The specific decisions will be selling a house, and changes       in housing wealth holdings. The two decisions will be analyzed because housing       assets likely have fewer measurement errors, and because housing is the major        component of wealth for most elderly persons. Housing decisions are important        from a policy perspective because they may represent precautionary savings to        finance long-term care, a substantial risk the elderly face.                                                                                                              The proposed conceptual model is an extension of the common Bayesian learning        model whereby prior risk perceptions are updated on the basis of information.        Our model holds that updated risk perceptions, in turn, influence behavior.          Risk perceptions will be estimated as enodogenous explanatory variables              simultaneously with health behaviors among the near-elderly and housing              decisions among the elderly. The panel structure of the data bases to be used        (4 waves of Health and Retirement Study; 3 waves of Asset and Health Dynamics        Among the Oldest Old) will allow for the modeling of behaviors in time 3 or 4        as a function of changes in risk perceptions regarding longevity and of needing      nursing home care between waves 1 and 2 and 1 and 3.                                                                                                                      n/a",PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY,6372233,R01AG015868,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' cholesterol', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' health behavior', ' health care service utilization', ' human middle age (35-64)', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' perception', ' prevention', ' prostate', ' socioeconomics', ' weight loss']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,181196,0.004012254357878204
"A PERSONAL STATUS MONITOR FOR THE HOME We propose to develop and evaluate a wireless Personal Status Monitor (PSM) that can monitor the use of musculature in a continuous and unobstructive fashion while a subject performs normal and usual daily activities in the home. This innovation will provide the caregiver specific information describing their patient's physical and functional performance in the home, without relying on self-reports or having the patient leave the home environment. The PSM will consist of three components: I) wireless sensors to detect the electromyographic (BMG) signal, 2) a small body-worn transceiver, and 3) a base station, which processes the signals for feature extraction and transmission to the caregiver. The proposed Phase l program will focus on the development of methods to recognize specific functional tasks based solely on surface EMG signals. We propose to develop and evaluate pattern recognition algorithms using neural networks for processing EMG signals obtained from healthy subjects during the performance of specific functional tasks selected from the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Proof of concept will be achieved by demonstrating that it is possible to accurately distinguish between these tasks using no more than 4 EMG sensors, even when extraneous motor activity is present. The commercial development of a PSM for the home will be continued during Phase II by: 1) designing and building the hardware, 2) developing the application software, and 3) expanding the development of intelligent algorithms to additional functional activities. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development of a new method for monitoring functional activity in the home. The innovation will rely on technological achievements involving wireless sensors and telemedicine to surpass the capability of current methods to measure functional activity in the home. It will replace, or augment, the current reliance on self-report questionnaires, non-specific physical activity monitors, and frequent home care or clinic visits to establish a patient record of physical activity in the home. The system will have commercial appeal to many of the rehabilitation specialties working with the elderly, neurologically impaired general orthopedic, cardiac, sports medicine and work-injured populations.  n/a",A PERSONAL STATUS MONITOR FOR THE HOME,6211028,R43AR047272,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' caregivers', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electromyography', ' home health care', ' human subject', ' patient monitoring device', ' telemetry']",NIAMS,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2000,92686,-0.02102880758575654

The goal of this project is to determine how individual risk perceptions             influence health behaviors among the near-elderly (51-61) and decisions              regarding wealth holdings among the elderly (70+). Among the near-elderly, the       following health behaviors will be studied: the use of preventive services           (mammography, prostate screening, and cholesterol screening), weight loss and        exercise. The preventive services are designed to reduce mortality from cancer       and heart disease. Weight loss and exercise are both preventive measures as          well as mitigators of harm that results from health shocks. Expanding the use        of these preventive and mitigating measures are important to reduce morbidity        and mortality from heart disease and cancer.

"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain and by shaping exposures to environmental hazards (e.g., air pollution, extreme temperatures, noise); however, developing accurate, time- varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to build causal relationships between the built environment and CVD and to inform policy-relevant, actionable interventions. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing longitudinal built environment exposure measures from street-view and satellite imagery using deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data from a) 500 participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3) and b) over 34 years of geocoded residential addresses from three large nationwide cohorts of over 288,000 US adult women and men from the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts.

"Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is responsive to NIH solicitation PA-17-089 for projects involving secondary analysis of pre-existing geriatric datasets. While presently there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, existing literature indicates that early diagnosis in the preclinical stage, i.e., before the onset of clinical symptoms, will be key to treatments. There is a pressing need for noninvasive predictors of cognitive decline that can enable early identification of individuals at Alzheimer’s disease risk. A mounting body of scientific evidence suggests that sleep disturbances (including microarchitectural disruptions to non-rapid-eye-motion sleep and decline in sleep quality) might be the earliest observable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. On-the-go sleep and activity monitoring could address the need for noninvasive indicators of cognitive decline in subjects who are in the (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we will build on preliminary results that reveal a set of sleep features derived from polysomnography (PSG) that are predictive of cognitive performance. We are proposing to perform secondary analysis of sleep and cognition data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort using state-of-the-art deep learning tools to enable sleep-based prediction of cognitive impairment for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. While PSG is the gold standard for sleep measurement, it is not well- suited for routine, day-to-day use. In comparison, wrist-based measurements (e.g. actigraphy, heart rate, ECG, and pulse oximetry) obtained from wearable devices allow “on-the-go” sleep monitoring. The combination of these on-the-go measures with the latest artificial intelligence tools is a feasible route to early Alzheimer’s diagnostics. We will use attention-guided long short-term memory autoencoders to identify overt and latent characteristics of the raw time-series datasets, which will allow us to more effectively mine the rich MESA data resource. Our deep learning framework will also take into account sociodemographic variables, indicators of health status, and medications. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the MESA-trained deep learning models will be performed on PSG and actigraphy data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, which is a longitudinal study designed to further our understanding of what differentiates normal aging from preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To address any concern about the “black-box” nature of deep learning models, we will compare the learned feature set with sleep microarchitectural features previously computed using classical statistical techniques. Previous data suggests that a subject’s apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE4) allele carrier status influences the degree to which their sleep patterns impact their cognitive abilities. We will verify this by incorporating ApoE4 status as an additional input to the deep learning model. Literature shows that over 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease have at least one clinical sleep disorder. The on-the-go prediction paradigm using noninvasive sleep measurements to be validated in this project will have a significant impact on early Alzheimer’s diagnostics and facilitate ongoing clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are a common feature of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease before the onset of symptoms would be critically important for disease management and therapeutics.

"Machine learning for analysis of walking patterns and physical activity in knee osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) exhibit altered walking patterns that cause repetitive, abnormal forces on the knee joint, leading to disease progression. Existing interventions to reduce knee loading during walking have not resulted in meaningful change in knee OA symptoms or joint structure. A key limitation of existing research has been the use of simplified metrics to describe walking patterns and not accounting for walking amount and intensity (i.e. physical activity). The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize walking patterns and activity in people with and without knee OA and to assess the associations of walking with 2-year change in knee OA outcomes. Machine learning approaches will be used to analyze ground reaction force (GRF) data and accelerometer-derived physical activity metrics in an existing, large, well- characterized cohort (n=2575) from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Machine learning approaches that use selected features and those that are agnostic and utilize all available information from time-varying GRFs will be used in combination with physical activity metrics to classify symptomatic and structural change. The results from machine learning approaches will be compared to those of common statistical approaches. This research will allow for characterization of the complex relationships between walking patterns and activity, providing novel insights into OA disease processes. Further, this research will provide valuable training in applying machine learning approaches to biomechanics data and may inform patient-specific strategies to optimize walking patterns and physical activity for personalized knee OA management.  The principal investigator will leverage prior training in biomedical engineering applied to OA research to further advance her skills in traditional and agnostic machine learning approaches for analyses of biomechanics and physical activity data. The sponsor and co-sponsor at Boston University (BU) will provide mentorship in clinical aspects of OA, implementation of the proposed studies in a large cohort, grantsmanship, and career development. The team will work with a collaborator in computational biomedicine at BU with expertise in machine learning to achieve the scientific and training goals of this project. In addition to hands-on training, the principal investigator will enroll in didactic coursework and workshops at BU related to machine learning and computer programming. Other key aspects of training include participation in research and networking opportunities at BU and other local Institutions, as well as national and international meetings. The sponsors and the Institution provide an environment where the PI will work and learn as a part of a diverse and interdisciplinary team of OA researchers across rehabilitation, rheumatology, epidemiology, computational methods, and imaging specialties. This postdoctoral training environment will prepare the principal investigator for a career as an independent researcher with expertise in machine learning approaches as applied to biomechanics for the study of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. Narrative This research will use machine learning to understand how walking patterns and physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis are related to pain and disease worsening.

"Physical Fitness as an Objective Biomarker for AD/ADRD Risk Modification About 6M Americans ≥65 years suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) which poses significant emotional, physical, and financial burden on patients and their families, and costs the US economy over $250 billion annually. AD/ADRD is a growing national public health crisis as the number of Americans ≥65 years is projected to double by 2050. There are no approved disease-modifying drugs for AD/ADRD, and no new symptom-modifying drug has been approved since 2003. This highlights the need for novel research approaches aimed at preventing AD/ADRD. Physical activity (PA) has been identified as the lifestyle intervention with the strongest potential to prevent AD/ADRD. However, most of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PA including the 23 ongoing RCTs currently sponsored by the NIA are small with short follow-up. Larger RCTs with longer follow-up are needed to provide definitive evidence of benefit. Identification of relevant biomarkers and quantification of future risk can mitigate long duration and cost of such RCTs. Epidemiologic studies with large database and long follow-up are limited by imprecise and unreliable self-reports of PA. We propose the novel concept of using cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a reliable biomarker of PA for AD/ADRD risk reduction. Like body composition, blood pressure and heart rate, CRF is considered a biomarker of PA. Just as well-controlled blood glucose leads to optimal HbA1C, PA of adequate duration, frequency and intensity also leads to optimal CRF. The current application has been designed to test the hypotheses that higher CRF is independently linked to a lower risk of incident AD/ADRD and to determine optimal levels of CRF assessed by a standardized exercise tolerance test (ETT), for minimizing AD/ADRD risk at both population and individual levels. Our Specific Aims are (1) to determine the relationship between CRF and incident AD/ADRD, taking into consideration a non-linear relationship and potential interactions of CRF with other risk factors and (2) to define incremental CRF levels that are linked to progressively lower risk of AD/ADRD, overall, and in subgroups by age, sex, and race. Our Aim 3 is to develop and validate a deep learning-based risk prediction model to determine the optimal CRF level for individuals to achieve the lowest risk of AD/ADRD. Recent advances in deep (machine) learning, a key artificial intelligence (AI) technology, allow modeling of complex non-linear relationships necessary for more precise risk prediction. These aims will be achieved by using ETT data on 911,698 Veterans free of baseline AD/ADRD (mean age, 61 years, 54,411 women, 202,000 African American, 50,107 Hispanic Americans) with up to 19 years of follow-up data. Explainable deep learning risk prediction model will be developed in the VA data, and validated with a Medicare population to develop a “precision medicine” approach that will personalize CRF recommendations for individuals to lower their AD/ADRD risk. Future studies will incorporate molecular biomarkers to validate AD diagnosis and ascertain effect of CRF and CRF modification on AD risk. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) affects about 6 million Americans ≥65 years but to date there are no drug that can cure it and no new drug to improve memory and function has been discovered in nearly past two decades. Physical activity is the only lifestyle intervention with the greatest potential to prevent AD/ADRD, but clinical trials of physical activity are often small with short follow-up, and self-reports of physical activity in observation studies are unreliable. We propose to use objectively measured cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a biomarker of physical activity in the largest epidemiological study to date in nearly 1 million Veterans using VA’s world-class electronic health record and advanced artificial intelligence technologies.",Physical Fitness as an Objective Biomarker for AD/ADRD Risk Modification,10055393,RF1AG069121,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Exercise Tolerance', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart Rate', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Research', 'Prevention trial', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sample Size', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cardiorespiratory fitness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'lifestyle intervention', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'risk mitigation', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'statistical learning', 'systematic review', 'unstructured data']",NIA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,2005396,-0.010127580973865924
"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,9883770,K99DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,K99,2020,87670,0.03667085759548141
"Closing the loop on markerless object tracking Abstract/Summary Tracking the movements of objects and parts of objects - referred to as pose estimation - is critical for understanding the mechanisms underlying complex behavior. Characterizing dynamic behaviors of animals (and other systems) is central to many disciplines, including computer science, physics, ethology, kinesiology, and sports medicine. Here we focus on neuroscience, where linking brain activity to associated dynamic behaviors is critical for both understanding normal function as well as effects of injury, disease, or degeneration. Invasive methods for measuring behavior are highly accurate, but require placement of sensors that may themselves interact with behavior and which may be susceptible to deterioration or infection. Video provides a non-invasive approach to characterizing behavior over time. Extracting behavior from video streams has, historically, been a slow and laborious process. Recent work in machine learning and artificial neural networks (ANNs), though, has revolutionized this process, making the analysis of complex video far easier and more accurate. While these systems are highly flexible, they were not designed for real time use, meaning that large video files must first be stored to disk for subsequent analysis. This poses two problems that this proposal will attempt to address. First, there is significant cost and management challenges associated with storage of large video stores, forming a practical barrier for adoption of this important technology for characterizing behavior. Second, estimates related to behavioral state are not available in real time so they cannot be used to control the experiment. We will develop a research methodology for “closing the loop”, by taking the networks trained by an existing and highly successful markerless object tracking system (DeepLabCut) and optimizing them for real time inference. After the system is functional, verified, and benchmarked, it will be shared with the community through open source repositories. Project Narrative Understanding the neural basis underlying complex behavior requires careful analysis of the dynamics of moving objects. Recent advances in computer vision has greatly facilitated our ability to track objects from video, but these tools are currently limited to offline analysis. Here we propose to build a system that addresses this problem by “closing the loop” using real time inference to be freely shared with the public to enhance ongoing research across the neuroscience spectrum.",Closing the loop on markerless object tracking,10047656,R03MH123990,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethology', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'haptics', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'sensor', 'time use', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,162500,-0.016406179960590822
"Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers” 7. Project Summary We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system; and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine- learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio- economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus, Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement, and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline) [H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis) Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation]. To accomplish the above aims, we have brought together a multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise, and a strong track record of collaboration. 8. Narrative We propose testing Adapt2Quit — an innovative motivational texting “recommender system.” Adapt2Quit enhances tailored motivational messaging systems using machine-learning algorithms to learn from, and adapt to, user feedback (prior and daily message ratings), thereby increasing message personal relevance. Our study will test Adapt2Quit motivational messaging texting with socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) smokers.","Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers”",9954825,R01CA240551,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biochemical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Motivation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Self Determination', 'Self Efficacy', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking and Health Research', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'active control', 'base', 'behavior change', 'design', 'digital', 'disadvantaged population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine replacement', 'primary outcome', 'quitline', 'recruit', 'rural healthcare', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,712077,0.004770925776039783
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9829561,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2020,165045,0.029131218524017972
"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,9981424,F31MH121039,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sweden', 'Techniques', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'World Health Organization', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational pipeline']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2020,45520,-0.009568285859526342
"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation. If successful, this intervention can be cost-effectively scaled on a population level, thereby making a high public health impact.",Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation,9995331,R01CA247156,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antismoking', 'Car Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Cost Measures', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empathy', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Health behavior change', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social support', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Trust', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized effectiveness trial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'sex', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'web site']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,730398,0.02614451384627733
"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9901577,R01MH111916,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breeding', 'Callithrix', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'data streams', 'feeding', 'gaze', 'human disease', 'human model', 'limb movement', 'machine learning method', 'microphone', 'motion sensor', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'speech processing', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'vibration', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,521954,-0.020709324803463897
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,9963258,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,508751,0.00796708612167888
"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,9952648,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,129600,-0.028047298672476483
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10131449,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'combat', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2020,457208,0.015575883591775008
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes. n/a",Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry,10023190,R01GM135927,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elements', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human Activities', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'heart rate monitor', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical sciences', 'multimodality', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2020,311680,0.007600092023939783
"Application of Machine Vision to Determine the Influence of Sleep States and Social Interactions on Vulnerability to Drug Addiction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this project is to develop a technology that will allow addiction researchers to measure the influence of social and sleep behaviors on drug intake behavior in large-scale genomic experiments to discover genes that regulate vulnerability to addiction. To accomplish this we will develop and make publicly available a highly innovative technology that, for the first time, will allow researchers to continuously monitor complex sleep and social behaviors in groups of mice, using low-cost and easily scaled video equipment. While drug-addiction behaviors have well-established bidirectional relationships with these behaviors, the genetic etiologies have not been fully elucidated. This critical gap is primarily due to technological barriers that prevent reliable phenotyping of large numbers of animals for specific sleep states and social behaviors. Currently available methods for assessing different sleep states are designed to be used with isolated animals and do not measure multiple individuals in a group. Although social context is known to be an influence on addiction vulnerability, it has been largely studied by changing the housing environment and testing isolated animals. We will exploit techniques of artificial intelligence to develop a neural network-based machine-vision method of video analysis of these behaviors, designed to be used in an ethologically-relevant group setting, over long periods of time. This non-invasive method will be a significant advance in behavioral phenotyping, fulfilling the demands of the high-throughput genetic studies necessary for optimizing the mouse as model of addiction. Our first specific aim is to develop a machine-vision method to measure rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, nonREM (NREM) sleep and waking behaviors of all individuals, for use in either single or group housed conditions. We will train and validate our machine-vision networks using EEG and EMG recordings. To demonstrate the utility and assess the performance of our method we will compare two different mouse lines (the control mouse C57Bl/6J and a genetically altered strain, B6.129P2-Nos2 tm1Lau/J) that are known to differ in these sleep parameters. We will compare the sleep of these two mouse strains in both group and single housing. Our second specific aim is to extend our method to enable assessment of group social dynamics and to record all social and active behaviors over multiple days. This will allow us to test the bidirectional effects of social and sleep behaviors with the consumption of self-administered methamphetamine. We will assess the effect of initial social status and sleep quality on drug consumption and also measure how the social interactions and sleep patterns are changed after the drug is available. Successful completion of these aims will yield a validated technology with the capacity to provide detailed measurements of sleep and social behaviors in mice for use in large scale genetic studies, thereby significantly enhancing researchers' ability to identify genes associated with addiction susceptibility. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Despite the urgency to find better treatments for substance abuse disorders, it has been difficult to map the complex interactions between factors contributing to the differences among individuals in vulnerability to addiction. A key issue underlying this knowledge gap is the lack of a technology that can be used to analyze the behaviors of mice—which are the preeminent animal model of addiction—in groups and over long periods of time in experiments testing responses to drug consumption. In the proposed project we will develop and make publicly available an innovative, non-invasive technology incorporating advanced computational and image- analysis approaches that will enable assessment of detailed behavioral activities of genetically diverse, group- housed mice in long-term addiction-susceptibility experiments, laying the groundwork for future studies to identify genes underlying differences among individuals in susceptibility.",Application of Machine Vision to Determine the Influence of Sleep States and Social Interactions on Vulnerability to Drug Addiction,9880430,R21DA048634,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Heritability', 'House mice', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Inbred C57BL Mice', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methamphetamine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polysomnography', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'REM Sleep', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Self Administration', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'limb movement', 'machine vision', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neural network', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid eye movement', 'response', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'social', 'social group', 'substance abuse treatment', 'tool']",NIDA,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2020,212500,-0.020656940964958084
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans.

"Dense Life-log Health Analytics from Wearable Sensors using Functional Analysis and Riemannian Geometry Project Summary The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled lifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.

"From Cells to Societies: Mechanisms by Which Microbial Parasites Control Host Phenotypes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbes can be social. In some groups of microbes that have parasitic lifecycles the social behavior of the many microbial cells can lead to the precise control of the animal they infect. The microbes orchestrate within the body and coordinate to form interactions that are as impressive as any other collective behavior from fish shoals to flocks of birds to ant trails. In some biological systems the manipulated animal is an ant and therefore belongs to its own collective, the colony. In our system we study the `zombie-ant' fungi (Ophiocordyceps) of tropical and temperate forests, which precisely control ants to leave their nest and bite into vegetation directly over the foraging trails of the colony. The function of such altered behavior becomes apparent when the fungus kills the ant and grows a stalk from its head that shoots out spores that infect other ants. The goal of this application is o develop models of such complex collective behavior by fungi controlling ants. We will develop computational and physical diffusion models of the development of the fungal collective, within its ant host. We will use high throughput Scanning Electron Microscopy of ant muscles and computer vision algorithms to develop 3D computational models and accurate networks of cells. We will perform micro-acoustic fluidic experiments to measure fungal behavior and develop physical diffusion models of the emergence of collective behavior. At the macroscopic scale we will measure infected ant behavior in the forest and build agent-based models to determine the rules explaining the effective targeting of ant trails by the fungal collective using the ant as a vehicle. Finally, we will perform experiments to understand the role of competition for the social behavior of microbes. This work is a collaboration among David Hughes, an expert of animal behavior and parasites, Ephraim Hanks, an expert on models of animal behavior, Danny Chen, a computer scientist expert in 3D models of cells, Francesco Costanzo, a theoretical mechanical expert in physical diffusion models and Tony Huang, an engineer expert in micro-acoustic fluidic experiments. Extensive collaboration already exists among the five researchers and four of the five occupy the same building at Penn State, ensuring an easy collaboration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Fungal parasites can act as a group to control the behavior of ants to increase transmission to the next host. We will use a diversity of modeling approaches to study parasite social behavior across scales.

"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10034797,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,733116,-0.004038544890562613
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9912818,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,581743,-0.023837070748483843
"Eavesdropping on heart-brain conversations during sleep for early detection and prevention of fatal cardiovascular disease ABSTRACT  The intimate link between the heart, brain and sleep is central to our well-being and ability to meet the demands of life. A majority of cardiovascular (CV) deaths occur in the early waking hours from sleep. For example, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), an extremely prevalent and devastating condition, claims more lives (>350,000/year) in the USA than all disease-related causes of death combined. A defibrillator can prevent SCA, but current clinical strategies are grossly inadequate, both in terms of identifying people at risk and importantly, monitoring and controlling the CV risk. To address this major gap, we are proposing an entirely novel approach for studying heart-brain interactions during sleep. To our knowledge, our compelling new preliminary data and innovative strategy are unprecedented.  In robust preliminary studies of animals and humans, we have identified unique signatures of evolving, potentially fatal, CV disease within electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms that otherwise cannot be detected by current clinical methods and conventional statistics. Our powerful new tools reveal these “hidden” signatures during sleep (i.e., as conscious activity decreases and autonomic control of the heart becomes prominent). This missing link we have identified between the heart, brain, spontaneous intrinsic arousals, and critical CV disease is independent (in multivariate analyses) of sleep disordered breathing (e.g., apnea) and established risk factors. Our novel and highly promising findings may account for the high incidence of CV deaths associated with sleep and have potential for broad application, ranging from animal models to improved reclassification of individuals currently consid- ered “low”, “moderate” or “high” risk in contemporary clinical practice. This is important because asymptomatic individ- uals without advanced CV disease comprise the majority of SCA victims. They also are the ones “missed” by current risk stratification methods and the most challenging to identify. Further, our fundamental new approach to EEG and ECG analysis will add new, clinically valuable, prognostic insight for patients with advanced CV disease (e.g., heart failure). This robust, inexpensive, personalized strategy for identifying who will and will not need lifesaving therapy will also avoid unnecessary procedures and complications, and thus, will provide substantial socioeconomic benefits.  This paradigm-shifting application for a NIH Director’s New Innovator Award incorporates clinical cardiac electro- physiology, critical care and sleep medicine with engineering, mathematics, artificial intelligence, statistical dynamical systems, and molecular, cellular and clinical research to enable early diagnosis and therapy of critical CV disease. Our unique approach for gaining novel mechanistic insight into CV pathology and risk during sleep is likely to spawn new avenues in collaborative multidisciplinary research. Because our new paradigm can be seamlessly incorporated into existing technology readily available in hospitals and clinics, we expect our findings to rapidly transform contem- porary clinical practice in multiple fields. Importantly, the ability to identify and decode “hidden” EEG and ECG signa- tures of early onset of fatal, subclinical CV illness, including SCA, the leading cause of death in the industrialized world, has extraordinary implications for human health and the potential for broad worldwide application. NARRATIVE  The treatment of heart disease after clinical presentation has limited success. Irreversible organ system damage often initiates by the time the patient presents clinically. We seek to introduce, understand and validate a completely new approach for analyzing heart and brain signals to reveal information about evolving critical disease in an individual that otherwise would remain undetected by current clinical methods until catastrophic clinical presentation. If validated, this new paradigm will have extraordinary implications for human health and the potential to open new avenues in research and therapy.",Eavesdropping on heart-brain conversations during sleep for early detection and prevention of fatal cardiovascular disease,10002962,DP2HL157941,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Apnea', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Pathology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Defibrillators', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'dynamic system', 'early onset', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized strategies', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,DP2,2020,2407500,0.021874464913513133
"Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Over 5.4 million cases of keratinocyte cancers (basal and squamous cell) are diagnosed annually and incidence of melanoma has increased 3% each year for the past 30 years. In the 2014 Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, the U. S. Surgeon General included strategies for coordinating messages on sun safety and physical activity, recognizing the need for sun safety among populations that engage in physical activity outdoors. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer; individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn. Melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Strava, a tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of mobile technologies for logging physical activity and providing social feedback on activities by other Strava users. The goal of this R21 research is to test the feasibility of interfacing with the Strava website and its mobile app to develop an algorithm that a) predicts when individuals are likely to be engaged in physical activity outdoors in the sun when ultraviolet radiation is high and b) delivers sun safety advice tailored to the time, location, and personal risk (e.g., skin sun sensitivity) of the Strava users. Concept focus groups with Strava users (n=16) and non-users (n=16) will provide input on the feasibility, content, and functions in the Strava Sun (SS) intervention. The algorithm that predicts future outdoor exercise will be developed using machine learning modeling on activity data provided by Strava users (n=1000). The SS intervention will be programmed to deliver ecologically-valid sun safety advice through Strava's open-source Applications Programming Interface (API) via email and comments in the Strava interface. The sun safety advice will be tailored to location, time, season and user's personal risk, employing advice algorithms we developed for a sun safety mobile app, sunZapp, and a social media message library in our Go Sun Smart intervention for outdoor recreation resorts. SS will be tested for usability (n=30 Strava users) prior to conducting a pilot field trial to establish feasibility of SS in practice (n=226 Strava users). The project is significant and innovative. A sun protection interface for the Strava platform will provide individuals who engage in regular physical activity personalized, ecologically-valid advice to help them practice sun safety during outdoor activities. It will contain a novel machine learning algorithm that predicts future high-risk behavior, i.e., outdoor physical activity, to provide precision prevention advice. The intervention will be delivered over an established and popular technology platform with over 42 million registered users. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer and individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn, a proximal biomarker of melanoma risk, perhaps explaining why melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Mobile technology for tracking physical activity has become increasingly prevalent and Strava, an activity tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of these technologies. This research will test the feasibility of delivering location-based, ecologically-valid sun safety advice to Strava users at times when they are predicted to be engaged in outdoor physical activity, by utilizing Strava's public open-source Applications Programming Interface.",Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava,10057198,R21CA241637,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Basal Cell', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cancer Control', 'Cessation of life', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Photosensitivity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protective Clothing', 'Published Comment', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Self Efficacy', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Social Network', 'Software Engineering', 'Squamous Cell', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'United States', 'anticancer research', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'data access', 'data format', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'forgetting', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'melanoma biomarkers', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety practice', 'skill acquisition', 'skin cancer prevention', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'sun protection', 'sun safety', 'usability', 'web site', 'willingness']",NCI,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R21,2020,444313,0.028057391016338175
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9709107,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'social factors', 'structured data', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,706182,-0.018544863651213064
"Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks Project Summary Translational studies showing a mechanistic interplay between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and sleep/circadian disruption has renewed interest in the maxim ‘sleep is of the brain, by the brain, and for the brain’. Relative to adults sleeping well, those exhibiting sleep deficiency (SD), defined as poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment, have greater AD risk (OR=1.55), cognitive decline (OR=1.68), or preclinical AD (OR=3.78). Since SD is observed early in the course of AD, it constitutes a prime target for prevention. Notwithstanding successes in delineating the mechanisms and functions of sleep, a critical gap remains in elucidating factors undergirding sleep disparities among blacks, marked by a greater AD risk burden. Blacks also shoulder a greater sleep burden as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the main SD indices, which are linked to increased vascular risks, inflammation, brain injury, and cognitive impairment. The multi-disciplinary team will utilize innovative dynamic and geospatial modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants of SD and its putative effects on the brain health of older blacks. We will leverage the success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup, comprising investigators with expertise in aging research, translational sleep and circadian sciences, brain health, health disparities, and geospatial and multi-level dynamic modeling. We will leverage the social capital and assets of our Community Steering Committee to enroll 504 blacks (60-75 years) from traditional and non-traditional venues to capture study endpoints. We will investigative the following aims: 1) To ascertain the psychosocial (social/emotional support, mood, discrimination, attitudes) and environmental (household [density, noise, air quality, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with SD; 2) To assess effects of SD on markers of brain injury (Hcy, NFL, GFAP, Tau & Amyloid-β peptides) and on neurocognitive functions (attention, language, memory, and executive function using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite and Trail Making Test). The contributions of vascular risk (obesity, BP, lipid, and glucose/HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) will be weighted; 3) To characterize blacks who are at increased risk of SD using Bayesian machine-learning modeling and forecast through Agent-Based modeling which amalgamation of psychosocial and environmental changes will lead to a reduced SD burden and related brain health profile among older blacks over time (5, 10, & 20 yrs.). The investigative team will use novel home-based digital recorders, innovative brain health biomarkers, geospatial analytics and dynamic systems modeling to describe the mechanisms of SD and delineate their potential role in explaining observed disparities in markers of brain health of older blacks. Project Narrative Despite the high risk for sleep-related morbidity, there is a paucity of data on sleep-disrupting psychosocial and environmental stressors associated with sleep deficiency (poor sleep, sleep apnea, and/or circadian misalignment) among older blacks. Our multi-disciplinary team will use novel mHealth devices recording sleep/activity cycles, light, noise, air quality, temperature, and greenspace exposure; novel brain biomarkers; and geospatial analytics to assess effects on sleep deficiency and delineate their role in explaining disparities in the brain and cognitive health of older blacks.",Mechanisms of sleep deficiency and effects on brain injury and neurocognitive functions among older blacks,9976783,R01AG067523,"['Activity Cycles', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Aphorisms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shoulder', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Strategic Planning', 'TNF gene', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Trail Making Test', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'age related', 'base', 'brain health', 'built environment', 'career', 'circadian', 'cognitive function', 'density', 'digital', 'disparity reduction', 'dynamic system', 'environmental change', 'environmental stressor', 'ethnic minority population', 'executive function', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'pre-clinical', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social capital', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'translational study', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,833876,-0.03147411447771884
"BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time. Project Summary/Abstract Health-risk behaviors, such as overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, and not adhering to medication, are responsible for increases in morbidity and mortality. To track and intervene during these health-risk behaviors, clinicians traditionally rely on self-reports. However, self-reports are inaccurate and biased. Therefore, we cannot use self-reports to validate health-risk behaviors in free-living conditions. Thus, an automated technique for validating health-risk behaviors is extremely necessary. With the growth and popularity of wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches), automatic monitoring of physical activity is possible. However, the devices often do not provide any visual confirmation, making it challenging to verify activities performed in free-living conditions. Cameras can capture point-of-view videos and can thus be used as a wearable device to capture videos for visual confirmation of activities, including health-risk behaviors. Such recordings can help us better understand health-risk behaviors. Additionally, video information can be automatically processed to confirm and validate health-risk behaviors. Recording videos of sensitive content and bystanders is associated with privacy and ethical concerns. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that can automatically detect health-risk behaviors, and most people are unwilling to wear cameras without raising privacy concerns. In addition to privacy concerns, people prefer wearables that are unobtrusive and small and that do not require frequent charging. Thus, a privacy-preserving, unobtrusive wearable camera would increase wearability. Infrared (IR) sensor arrays have the potential to provide independent temperature readings, which allows determining whether an object is near or far. The IR sensor array can help record only the wearer and objects near the wearer, while filtering out distant objects. IR sensor arrays have a small power footprint, thus providing longer battery life. Our project aims to develop a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection platform that will make it possible to detect and intervene upon health-risk behaviors in real time. In this project, we will (1) develop the wearable behavior-detection device that allows visual confirmation without burdening the wearer. The device will augment RGB camera data with IR sensor array data for privacy-conscious recording and automatic behavior detection. (2) We will test various designs to determine a user's acceptability to wear the device. Then, we will test various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the best algorithm for detecting health-risk behaviors. (3) We will incorporate the best-performing behavior-detection algorithm so that it can run on the developed wearable device. With a behavior-detection algorithm running on an acceptable wearable device, the ability to detect health-risk behaviors in real time will become a reality. Ultimately, our wearable device will allow researchers to test and apply appropriate behavioral interventions in real time, rather than relying on self-reports, whenever health-risk behaviors occur. Project Narrative Several activities involving hand-to-mouth gestures (e.g., overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, or non- adherence to medication) are associated with health-risk behaviors that are a leading cause of preventable deaths. Being able to automatically monitor health-risk behaviors using wearable video cameras will improve our understanding of these behaviors and will ultimately enable us to design effective methods to intervene when they occur. We will develop BehaviorSight, a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection device that will allow future researchers and behavioral scientists to use the device for monitoring numerous everyday health-risk behaviors in free-living settings.",BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time.,10043674,R21EB030305,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dietitian', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hyperphagia', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'design', 'drinking', 'image processing', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication nonadherence', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'privacy preservation', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,606713,0.02206214466877422
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,10003222,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'algorithm training', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,640068,-0.01735831031178623
"Cardiovascular implications of sleep characteristics using real-world objective sleep data Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the U.S. Impaired sleep is recognized as a strong risk factor of CVD. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, abnormal sleep duration, and poor sleep quality have each been associated with CVD-related morbidity and mortality. Major limitations of existing studies on sleep and CVD is the lack of objective sleep measurement and the lack of understanding of the multi-dimensional nature of sleep and its complex interactions with CVD. In addition, emerging evidence also suggests potential relationships between sleep disorders and preclinical CV conditions, which often occur before the clinical manifestation of CVD. Blood pressure parameters including systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) are examples of preclinical CVD that have prognostic value for future CV events. However, no research has yet explored if sleep disorders beyond OSA (such as impaired sleep quality and abnormal sleep duration) are risk factors attributable to preclinical CV conditions. This is a critical area of inquiry since understanding the complex relationships between sleep and preclinical and clinical CV conditions will allow healthcare providers to implement targeted interventions to reduce CVD. The proposed study will examine whether PSG-derived objective measures of sleep obtained in the clinical setting would be predictive of CVD and preclinical CVD. Given that hypertension is one of the major important CV risks and has been most well studied CV risk factor in relation to sleep, SBPV, mean SBP, and other blood pressure metrics will be the focus of the preclinical CVD. Our main aim is to examine the relationships between multidimensional sleep characteristics (in terms of duration, efficiency, quality, and disordered sleep breathing) and clinical CV conditions, after adjusting for personal, clinical, and other confounders. We will use sleep data collected from more than 7,000 individuals who completed a diagnostic sleep study at the University of Virginia Health System in 2010 - 2018. Machine learning (ML) models will be used to analyze the multidimensional PSG measures. This proposed study represents the largest real-world dataset on objective sleep measures, which will allow us to simultaneously examine the entire spectrum of sleep and advance our understanding about the impact of sleep on CV outcomes. Project Narrative Impaired sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other adverse health outcomes. We will examine how various dimensions of sleep including duration, efficiency, and disordered breathing from polysomnography are related to cardiovascular risk within a healthcare setting. To better understand the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism, we will examine how sleep measures may affect blood pressure variability, an emerging yet underappreciated blood pressure parameter to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.",Cardiovascular implications of sleep characteristics using real-world objective sleep data,10048498,R21HL150502,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Manifestation', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Prevention Measures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'blood pressure variability', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'indexing', 'limb movement', 'mortality', 'pre-clinical', 'prognostic value', 'risk minimization', 'sleep abnormalities', 'sleep quality', 'sleep quantity', 'supervised learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,137730,0.06449133999586681
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3.

"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes.

"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10029156,R01HL153543,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Education', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'brief intervention', 'clinically significant', 'dietary adherence', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'pilot trial', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'skills training', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2020,727923,0.015314697141110398
"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY People vary in both the quantity and the quality of their sleep. Traditional sleep “stages” (for example, slow- wave sleep or REM sleep) can exhibit different neural correlates (as measured by electroencephalography, EEG) in different people and at different times during the night. Standard approaches for characterizing sleep (“staging”) do not take this variability into account, however. Here we suggest that attempts to use EEG and other data to infer sleep stages should in fact tackle the heterogeneity between and within individuals explicitly, to yield more accurate classification not just of an individual’s minute-by-minute sleep, but of the sleeper’s typical characteristics more generally. Quantitative, data-driven individual sleep profiles will be important prerequisites for emerging large-scale molecular genetics and other ‘omics studies of sleep, and for driving personalized sleep medicine more generally. Specifically, we propose to leverage more than ten thousand whole-night polysomnography (PSG) studies from the demographically diverse National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), in order to optimally apply machine-learning methods to sleep signals. Most importantly, the NSRR dataset will enable approaches that take the fundamental heterogeneity of sleep into account: this is a rate-limiting step that has not been tackled by previous approaches. We hypothesize that it is not the large training set per se, but rather the increased prospects for better-matched training data, combined with the methods developed here, that will be beneficial. To this end, we will build and disseminate a novel, multi-level automated sleep classifier based on the world’s largest dataset of sleep signals. PROJECT NARRATIVE People vary considerably not just in how much they sleep, but also in the types of sleep they typically have. Standard approaches to describing sleep, primarily developed in the 1960s, only partially capture this variability: we propose to use a range of measures, including brain activity, on over ten thousand sleeping individuals to generate more accurate, data-driven, personalized profiles of how a person's sleep varies over a night. Sleep factors are associated with multiple physical and neuropsychiatric illnesses, and so better measurement of the underlying processes will be critical for future genetic and biomarker studies aimed at understanding the links between sleep, health and disease.",Leveraging National Sleep Research Resource Data for Personalized Sleep Profiling,9852475,R01HL146339,"['Adult', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Label', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mythology', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Polysomnography', 'Process', 'Property', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stage I Sleep', 'Stage II Sleep', 'Staging', 'Stretching', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'heuristics', 'implicit bias', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular scale', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'open source', 'real world application', 'sleep health', 'sleep onset', 'tool', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,444813,0.06952018717730009

Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging.

"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. This knowledge can be utilized to reduce the public health burden of tobacco use.",Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment,9839496,R01CA224537,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anger', 'Behavioral', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'knowledge base', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'primary outcome', 'risk prediction model', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,617352,-0.010737007185148714

"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative network of leading behavioral scientists from multiple disciplines who conduct the experimental interventions, share research activities and findings, collaborate on joint projects, and brainstorm new intervention opportunities, building from findings in basic science. This application renews the NBER Roybal Center for the next five years. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Health is a foundational source of wellbeing for people of all ages. As resilient as human physiology may be, and as random and unexpected as health events may be to any particular person at any particular time, health is also affected by the lifestyle decisions that we make, our behavioral interactions with the medical care system, and how we respond to adverse health events when they occur. The NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health will take research from basic science and translate it into applications that address real-world problems in ways that directly, broadly, and cost-effectively improve population health.",NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health,10017809,P30AG034532,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohols', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Factors', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Discipline', 'Economics', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Natural experiment', 'Onset of illness', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Vaccination', 'Wellness Program', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior influence', 'care systems', 'career life balance', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'exercise intervention', 'experimental study', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'meetings', 'nutrition', 'outreach', 'population health', 'programs', 'provider networks', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'synergism']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P30,2020,531220,0.012383900152317188
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9990732,U01CA229437,"['Aphorisms', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Boredom', 'Cause of Death', 'Cigarette', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health behavior change', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer prevention', 'coping', 'craving', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'evidence base', 'field theory', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'novel', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'sensor', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'theories', 'willingness']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,623237,0.0266030232635443
"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9851750,R01MD010362,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Distal', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'behavior change', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'contextual factors', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'disability', 'distress tolerance', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mindfulness', 'mortality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'smoking abstinence', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social cohesion', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,849960,0.013989959927575384
"Enhanced Measurement and Modeling of Sleep Electrophysiology to Better Understand Sleep Disparities Project Summary Health disparities associated with race and ethnicity are a major public health issue in the United States. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that differences in people's quality and quantity of sleep may account for part of this problem. Here we wish to study patterns of sleep, using full polysomnography data in a large and diverse cohort, to better understand what causes some individuals and groups to differ in their typical sleep, and to link this variation in sleep to relevant health outcomes. In order to study sleep as a mediator of health disparities associated with race/ethnicity, we propose to first unpack the “sleep” term into profiles of quantitative traits (Aim 1). Second, we will test for demographic moderators of the associations between race/ethnicity and sleep traits, which can point to likely socioeconomic and social/environmental contextual mediators (Aim 2). Finally, we will demonstrate the relevance of these findings by testing for association with health outcomes – primarily cardiovascular disease risk and measures of allostatic load – and estimating the extent to which sleep accounts for racial/ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will apply a targeted array of data-driven analytic methods, from data science, machine learning, computational neuroscience and causal modeling, to characterize individual differences in patterns of sleep. A more nuanced understanding of what constitutes “poor sleep” is important because different aspects of sleep are likely to have qualitatively different links to demographic and biomedical factors, including age, sex, lifestyle factors, inherited genetic makeup, circadian rhythms, medication effects and current state of physical and mental health. By disentangling this network of inter-related variables, we will be better positioned to understand – and ameliorate – the effects of the numerous factors that can induce racial/ethnic disparities in sleep, and consequently, in health too.

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI.

"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood.

"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood.

"Smartband/smartphone-based automatic smoking detection and real time mindfulness intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US. Effective smoking cessation interventions are available but underutilized. Smoking cessation interventions delivered by smartphone apps are a promising tool for helping smokers quit. Delivery of treatments via smartphone apps may maximize the likelihood of use by smokers and the potential impact on smoking behavior. However, currently available smartphone apps for smoking cessation have not exploited their unique potential advantages to aid quitting. Notably, no available apps utilize wearable technologies; all current apps require users to self-report their smoking; and no apps deliver treatment automatically contingent upon smoking. Therefore, this pilot trial will test the feasibility of using a smartband to detect and track smoking and deliver brief smoking cessation interventions by smartphone app in real time. The interventions to be delivered will be brief mindfulness exercises that have been previously shown to reduce craving and smoking. This trial uses SmokeBeat, a novel mobile technology platform that uses multimodal data from wristband sensors to monitor and detect smoking, notify smokers about their smoking in real time and deliver real time interventions triggered by detected smoking episodes. SmokeBeat also applies machine learning to smoking tracking data to identify individual smoking patterns and deliver real time interventions targeted at predicted smoking episodes. This trial tests a three-step intervention to reduce smoking, in which smokers first become aware of their smoking and triggers by tracking smoking; then gain a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking by “mindful smoking”; and finally learn to work mindfully with cravings rather than smoke. Briefly, daily smokers (N=200, ≥5 cig/day) will wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a “mindful smoking” exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness exercise (“RAIN”: recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profile for 30 days post-quit. Aim 1 will be to determine treatment fidelity. Fidelity measures will be: (1) percent of smoking episodes correctly detected; (2) percent of “mindful smoking” exercises correctly triggered by smoking; and (3) users’ real time ratings of how timely “RAIN” was delivered to predicted smoking episodes. Aim 2 will be to determine adherence to treatment. Adherence measures will be: (1) percent of time spent wearing the smartband; (2) percent of smoking notifications answered; (3) percent of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings (e.g., timeliness and others) answered; and (4) percent of mindfulness exercises completed. Aim 3 will be to determine the acceptability of treatment. Acceptability measures will be: (1) average helpfulness ratings after each mindfulness exercise; (2) feedback on user experience surveys. Overall: this project tests a highly innovative technology-based mindfulness intervention for smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent developments in mobile technology suggest new and innovative ways to deliver effective smoking cessation treatments. This project will test the feasibility of using a smartband to automatically monitor and detect smoking and deliver real time mindfulness interventions via smartphone app to reduce smoking.

"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10029357,R01DK125414,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Promotion Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cancer risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'control theory', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'mHealth', 'personalized medicine', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'relapse risk', 'theories', 'treatment duration', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,532871,0.04708133464865963
"Sleep Health Profiles in Middle-aged Workers in Relation to Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health Middle-aged workers are vulnerable to having poor sleep, which is a public concern as it may lead to decreased productivity at work and increased risks of health problems over time. Most studies have associated one aspect of sleep (often focusing on sleep duration) with work or health-related variables, lacking a comprehensive understanding of how the combinations of multiple dimensions of sleep within individuals are associated with work-related stress and health outcomes. For example, a combination of sufficient sleep duration, regular sleep/wake, efficient sleep, and no insomnia symptom may be more predictive of concurrent and later cardiovascular and cognitive health than sleep duration alone. We propose to use multidimensional sleep health profiles that measure “which” and “how many” sleep problems co-occur within individuals. Harmonizing two independent project data sets from the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS) and Work, Family & Health Study (WFHS), the proposed study aims at examining the relationships between work-to-nonwork conflict (work stress carried over to and interfering with family and personal activities including sleep), sleep health profiles, and cardiovascular and cognitive health. Aim 1 will identify sleep health profiles in middle-aged workers and examine the associations of work-to-nonwork conflict with the sleep health profiles. Using extensive measures of self- reported and actigraphy-measured sleep, we will identify a priori-defined and empirically-derived sleep health profiles in diverse forms and will evaluate reproducibility of sleep health profiles across MIDUS and WFHS samples. Aim 2 will examine the associations of the sleep health profiles with cardiovascular health outcomes. Taking advantage of two cohorts in MIDUS that were sampled before and after the U.S. Great Recession period (2007-2009), we will also examine the health impacts of a macro- level stressor, whether those who were exposed to the economic recession exhibit a stronger link between sleep health profiles and cardiovascular outcomes than a propensity-matched sample who were not exposed to the recession but otherwise equal on all observables. Aim 3 will further examine the associations of the sleep health profiles with cognitive outcomes, leveraging MIDUS longitudinal cognitive data that include objectively measured episodic memory and executive functioning. We will also explore (1) whether sleep health profiles mediate the relationships between work-related stress (work-to-nonwork conflict) and cardiovascular and cognitive health, (2) potential moderation by sex and race, and (3) daily characteristics that predict optimal sleep health nights (using machine-learning). The proposed sleep health profiles can be broadly used to improve prediction accuracy in health screening tools. Focusing on middle-aged workers will contribute to decreasing health disparities in the workforce and promoting work productivity and healthy aging. Findings will inform the development of sleep-focused interventions to improve sleep and health among middle-aged workers who are in greater need. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of sleep health profiles among U.S. middle-aged workers is expected to increase understanding of how the combinations of multiple sleep characteristics relate to work-related stress and cardiovascular and cognitive health. The identified sleep health profile can be broadly used to improve prediction accuracy in health screening tools and can provide a basis for developing population-level sleep health interventions.

"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day. The findings of the study about healthy eating patterns will also improve dietary recommendations by adding messages on when and how often to eat during a day.",TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS,9830609,R01CA226937,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anthropometry', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calories', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Evaluation', 'Fasting', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'dietary guidelines', 'doubly-labeled water', 'epidemiology study', 'food consumption', 'good diet', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'prudent diet', 'tool', 'vector', 'waist circumference', 'western diet']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,396585,0.00848861664178355
"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY Emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. However, engaging in these healthy behaviors peaks during the childhood and adolescent years, and steeply deteriorates into emerging adulthood. Interventions promoting physical activity, reduced sedentary time, and sufficient sleep typically focus on the adoption of these behaviors. Yet, when these interventions are successful, new patterns of behavior are not maintained and typically regress back to baseline levels. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance. To address this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, deliberations, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity, habits) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, reactive processes are difficult to measure using retrospective methods because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct a prospective within- subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period. Ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-24, N=300) will be recruited from the Happiness & Health Cohort (R01DA033296). We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location, social proximity, voice/text communication) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. These data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within-days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity, ≥120 min sedentary time, ≥7 hr sleep) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life.

The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learning to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are general, group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and methods from this project will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Initiative’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults.

"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.  REL EVAN CE (Se e in stru cti ons): The proposed research will develop and field test an innovative computationally-enabled personalized behavior change model that will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and is designed to be integrated into clinical practice.

"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9994897,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2020,41640,0.03211705840307496
"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,9886675,R01NR013658,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Beds', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emotional Stress', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Financial Activity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'fitbit', 'functional outcomes', 'group intervention', 'health assessment', 'health management', 'health related quality of life', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tv watching']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,669305,-0.011102542925901309
"The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, course work, mentored laboratory training (practicum), and attendance to targeted conferences and seminars, with the common goal of supporting his transition to being an independent scientist. Project Narrative The overarching objective of this K01 career development award is to foster the transition of Dr. Azizi Seixas into an independent scientist in the area of sleep and cardiovascular disease and health disparities. The proposed study will investigate a novel mechanism underlying associations between insufficient sleep, obesity, and disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Findings from the study will be the basis of sleep and obesity interventions to reduce CVD risk, especially among diverse groups burdened by cardiovascular disease.",The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites,9841428,K01HL135452,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cholesterol', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Intolerance', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleeplessness', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'disparity reduction', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'laboratory experience', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pedagogical content', 'post stroke', 'prevent', 'racial disparity', 'secondary analysis', 'sleep physiology', 'social health determinants', 'stroke survivor', 'symposium']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2020,179820,0.047131880375656014
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10107688,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,256550,-0.020362932253076418
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9988193,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,771233,-0.008114796562635192
"Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors disproportionately affect black adults, and these disparities are evident early in the life course. Genetic factors do not appear to explain this difference, and studies have increasingly implicated socioeconomic risk factors. Among the most prominent risk factors for racial disparities in CVD is educational attainment, which is strongly correlated with smoking, hypertension, and CVD over the life course. Yet it is unclear which aspects of schooling are most salient. One possible explanation for racial disparities in CVD is that black youth often attend highly racially segregated schools. Segregation is thought to be linked with CVD due to increased stress and discrimination; social norms and peer influence; and the constraining of socioeconomic opportunities that reduces income and healthcare access later in life. Yet despite the fact that school segregation has increased in recent years, there are no studies examining the effects of recent school segregation trends on CVD risk factors. The goal of this study is to provide this urgently needed evidence. In particular, we take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on the effects of education on CVD. Since 1990, numerous local court decisions have resulted in “resegregation” in school districts across the country. We link nationwide data on these court decisions and school district-level measures of school segregation with CVD outcome data from two large nationally representative U.S. cohort studies of affected youth: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health, N≈90,000) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N≈8,000). We employ the quasi-experimental technique of instrumental variables analysis, which reduces typical confounding by factors such as unobserved individual and family characteristics. In Aim 1, our goal is to estimate the short- term effects of school segregation on CVD risk factors—including smoking, physical activity, obesity, and mental health—among youth while they are still in school. In Aim 2, we will examine the long-term effects of school segregation in the decades that follow, with outcomes including those in Aim 1 in addition to objectively measured CVD biomarkers, diabetes, and hypertension. We will also undertake exploratory analyses to determine possible mediating pathways. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of CVD risk factors differs in response to school racial segregation. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of school racial segregation on CVD risk factors, helping to inform school-based, clinical, and community interventions to reduce persistent and inequitable racial disparities in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the short-term and long-term effects of school racial segregation on risk factors for heart disease. We will also assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to school segregation. This will inform the development of public health programs and school-based interventions to address black-white disparities in heart disease.",Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults,9943540,R01HL151638,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Country', 'Court Decisions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desegregation', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Family Characteristics', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Stress', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health', 'Natural experiment', 'Obesity', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'black/white disparity', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'community intervention', 'data archive', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'forest', 'health care availability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'novel marker', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'physical inactivity', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'racial disparity', 'resilience', 'response', 'school district', 'segregation', 'social', 'social norm', 'socioeconomics', 'teenage fertility', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'young adult']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,808862,0.012727462622607398
"The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored. In short, while poor sleep could be an important contributor to health disparities and accelerated aging, we know relatively little about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This K01 application will provide key training for career advancement and begin to close this gap in knowledge. To accomplish this goal, a randomized field experiment with 400 participants, each enrolled for over one month, in Chennai, India, will (1) objectively measure sleep and key environmental factors to provide preliminary evidence on the role of environmental causes of sleep deprivation in an urban environment, (2) rigorously evaluate two simple scalable interventions to reduce sleep deprivation among low-income adults in their natural environments, (3) estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision- making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, alcohol consumption), and earnings, and (4) utilizing questions regarding sleep asked of both RCT participants and a 50,000 person nationally-representative sample, estimate the extent of sleep deprivation and its impacts more broadly in urban India. The training aims underpinning the research aims and the applicant's long-term research goals are to expand knowledge and skills in: (1) cognitive psychology and the measurement of cognitive function, (2) aging, and (3) machine learning and predictive modeling. This training, accomplished through multiple avenues including coursework, directed study, and mentorship, will directly facilitate the proposed research and extend the scope and impact of the applicant's long-term research career studying health disparities and interactions between health and decision-making which may impact both cognitive and physical health as individuals age. Notably, while this application focuses on the impacts of sleep deprivation, the potential for health to shape decision-making is much broader. Constant exposure to other aspects of poor health associated with poverty, such as pain, also have the potential to exert a mental tax, leading to impaired cognition and poor decisions. Such a negative feedback loop between these factors and decision-making has the potential to further exacerbate health disparities. The far-reaching applicability of this idea beyond the direct scope of this proposal opens the door to high public-health significance through a wide variety of channels. Project narrative Although sleep has significant potential to impair cognition and impede health, relatively little is known about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in “real-world” settings with extended time frames. This research will begin to close this gap in knowledge through a 400 person randomized trial in Chennai, India, which will objectively and rigorously measure sleep and key environmental factors impacting sleep, evaluate the impact of two simple and scalable interventions to improve sleep, and estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision-making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, tobacco consumption), and earnings. Providing rigorous evidence on these relationships and improving our collective understanding of the causes and costs to sleep deprivation, including not just direct health outcomes, but also shifts in preferences and decision-making directly relevant to health, will provide policy-relevant information important to improving health and healthy behaviors as well as promoting heathy and economically-secure aging.",The Health and Behavioral Effects of Sleep Deprivation Among the Urban Poor in India,9863981,K01AG055691,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Career Mobility', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Cost Measures', 'Decision Making', 'Developing Countries', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impaired health', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adverse outcome', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure reduction', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cost', 'diarrheal disease', 'disadvantaged population', 'discount', 'econometrics', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sleep health']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2020,127872,0.05003899586750168
"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health Disparities at the US/Mexico Border: The Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NoCHeS) Study ABSTRACT Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are all highly prevalent in the US population and are associated with significant morbidity, including poor mental health, impaired neurocognitive function, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease. In the context of the high prevalence of pernicious sleep disturbances, there is evidence that sleep disparities exist in the population, such that racial/ethnic minorities – including Mexican-Americans – are at increased risk of sleep disturbances. This is alarming, since this group is also at increased risk for many of the adverse cardiometabolic and functional outcomes linked to sleep disturbances. These associations may be influenced by economic hardship, psychosocial stress, unhealthy behaviors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking), and acculturation – the degree to which an individual adopts (in this case) traditional Mexican versus American culture. The first goal of this project is to examine sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep apnea severity among Mexican-Americans and examine the role of these social-behavioral factors in this relationship. Second, this study aims to examine the role of sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk in this population and explore the role of acculturation, psychosocial stress, economic hardship, and/or unhealthy behaviors in these associations. To accomplish this, this project will partner with the Mariposa Community Health Center, the federally qualified clinic in the Nogales, AZ area. Nogales is a small city on the US/Mexico border that is an ideal location for studying non-urban Mexican- Americans, as it is made up of 83% Hispanics/Latinos, 33% immigrants, and 77% who primarily speak Spanish at home. This community-engaged project will partner with Mariposa and their Platicamos Salud program that uses experienced Community Health Workers (promotoras de salud) to collect data and perform home visits. The study will recruit N=900 Mexican-Americans and N=200 Non-Hispanic Whites to complete a battery of assessments from a clinic visit (questionnaires, interviews, exam for anthropometry and arterial stiffness, and collection of biomarkers), a 1-night home sleep apnea assessment, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording, and a 2-week home monitoring period with sleep diary and actigraphy. This will result in a rich dataset that can help to identify and reduce sleep disparities in the population and point to potential intervention approaches to reducing cardiometabolic disease disparities. The analytic plan will take advantage of a machine-learning analytic approach, which will be used to evaluate the complex relationships among all of these variables. This project will address many relevant issues in sleep medicine, health disparities research, and border health. The partnership with Mariposa will enhance recruitment, promote research integrity (or ensure appropriateness of research methods), and facilitate dissemination of the study results into the community through education programs associated with Platicamos Salud and other community outreach efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The primary goal of this study is to assess sleep health among Mexican-Americans at the US/Mexico border, characterize relationships with cardiometabolic disease risk, and investigate the role of social-environmental factors including acculturation, stress, socioeconomics, and health behaviors. Short sleep duration, insomnia disorder, and sleep apnea are highly prevalent in the population. These conditions are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, daytime functioning problems, and poor mental health. Disparities in sleep health in racial/ethnic minorities exist, including Mexican-Americans. In particular, social-environmental factors at the US-Mexico border may play an important role in sleep health disparities. This project will not only allow for increased understanding of the complex relationship among sleep, health, and social-environmental pressures, but through a community partnership it can maximize our ability to reduce these disparities.

"Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S. Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.  Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine, and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a 2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social feedback from other postpartum women.  This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The postpartum period represents a unique time in a women’s life when many women gain excess weight and make the transition to becoming overweight or obese. We propose to rigorously study predictors of postpartum obesity and evaluate an innovative approach to improve weight loss in the postpartum period using an online behavioral weight loss program and social feedback from a team of other postpartum women. By identifying women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and testing interventions that are low cost, sustainable, and remotely delivered, we hope to significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in women, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10040416,K23HL153667,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Censuses', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perinatal', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'gestational weight gain', 'health care service utilization', 'healthy lifestyle', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel strategies', 'obesity prevention', 'patient oriented', 'peer support', 'postpartum weight', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,175248,-0.007468592999192823
"DORMIR: Determinants, Outcomes, Responses and Markers of  Insufficient sleep in Rural-Urban settings Project Summary The widening gap in all-cause and CVD-mortality and morbidity rates in rural and urban America is at an all- time high. Latino/as, the largest minority ethnic group in the U.S., appear to be most affected by rural-urban divide in CVD outcomes, as they are disproportionately burdened by CVD risk (overweight/obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes) and CVD mortality (20%, 2nd leading cause of death among Latino/as) relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Unlike other groups where individuals in rural and urban areas have differing CVD risk, rural and urban Latino/as have similarly high rates of CVD risk. Although, healthy diets/ nutrition, smoking cessation, and regular physical activity are linked to CVD risk, they have not been very effective in reducing the CVD burden among racial/ethnic groups, specifically among Latino/as. Several studies indicate that insufficient sleep (<7hrs./day) explains a significant amount of the CVD burden among Latino/as. Preliminary evidence indicates that insufficient sleep may contribute to the observed CVD burden among Latino/as, as Latino/as have greater odds of experiencing insufficient sleep compared with non-Hispanic whites. Evidence also shows that insufficient sleep, which is associated with potentially life-threatening CVD, is a key modifiable risk factor with great potential to reduce health disparities. However, it is unclear what factors contribute to insufficient sleep (IS) disparities and IS-related CVD burden among rural and urban Latino/as. To address these gaps, we will enroll 525 Latino/as in rural and urban communities to participate in home-based studies using novel mHealth devices. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify behavioral, genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors that are associated with insufficient sleep and IS-related CVD and 2) assess effects of insufficient sleep on CVD risk markers (obesity, blood pressure, lipid profile, and fasting plasma glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammatory risk markers (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α). This study will provide multi-level evidence supporting epidemiological findings of greater rates of insufficient sleep among Latino/as, which may explain their disproportionate burden of CVD risk. It will also assess whether and why rural and urban differences in IS exist among Latino/as and how that may lead to IS-related CVD outcomes. These data will provide: 1) the foundation for interventions to mitigate adverse effects of insufficient sleep on CVD health outcomes, 2) evidence to delineate factors underlying insufficient sleep and CVD burden among Latino/as in rural and urban settings, and 3) a possible explanation of behavioral, genetic, environmental and psychosocial determinants of insufficient sleep and related CVD risk factors in rural and urban Latino/as. Findings can lead to actionable clinical, lifestyle, and policy interventions to improve Latino health. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that Latino/as exhibit a greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation. It will provide multi-level evidence on behavioral, genetic, psychosocial and environmental determinants of insufficient sleep and sleep-related CVD risk and inflammation markers among rural and urban Latino/as. These data will provide the foundation for interventions to mitigate adverse effects of insufficient sleep on health outcomes.","DORMIR: Determinants, Outcomes, Responses and Markers of  Insufficient sleep in Rural-Urban settings",9976872,R01HL152453,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air', 'Americas', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth Place', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet and Nutrition', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Household', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Level of Evidence', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Seminal', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleeplessness', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'actigraphy', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'circadian', 'clinically actionable', 'density', 'design', 'diverse data', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'good diet', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'mHealth', 'models and simulation', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'population based', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'response biomarker', 'rural area', 'rural setting', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'urban area', 'urban disparity', 'urban setting']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,847392,0.04640019439740848
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9938687,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2020,710639,-0.013608341764188778
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9938564,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2020,355478,0.038425226576229515
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9899101,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2020,572773,0.0326218066490456
"Rodent Behavioral Core: The Analysis of Behavior Behavioral neuroscience links systems-level circuitry to behavior, cognition and emotion and is thus critical for understanding the afflictions that affect neuropsychiatric patients. Linking cognitive changes in a behaving rat or mouse to targeted manipulations of neural circuitry requires the convergence of expertise from scientific fields inside and outside of neuroscience. In designing research projects to understand the anatomy, genetics, and pharmacology underlying the control of behavior, researchers must understand the nature of the task, its measurements, and how to interpret the data. Several steps lie between the design of the experiment and the behavioral output, including choice of task (e.g., operant vs mazes), how to train the animal (shaping vs conditioning), the type of surgical manipulation (ablation, cannulation, inactivation, stimulation, etc.), and the format of data for analysis (summary vs. trial-by-trial). Most neuroscience researchers who use standard off-the-shelf behavioral tasks are not experts in the psychology of behavior and must therefore rely on experts in the domain of cognition.  Complex cognitive behavior in rodents is often gauged by measuring the pattern of behavioral responses in tasks that involve, for example, decision-making, attention, memory, rule learning, flexibility, discrimination, and problem solving. In these tasks, rats and mice typically indicate their decisions by nose-poking visual patterns on a touchscreen like an iPad, making nose-poke entries into a series of lit holes, or depressing an extended lever triggered by time or cues. Some cognitive functions extrapolated from animal behavior have positively informed our investigation of cognitive functions in humans. Such animal-to-human approaches (e.g., delayed response) have directed the design and development of analogous tests for use in humans (e.g., self-ordered working memory). Behavioral neuroscience has also benefitted in the opposite direction by means of human-to-animal approaches as in the case of extradimensionsal/intradimensional set shifting, a test based upon the principles of the human Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. Together, these advances in behavioral testing have been particularly useful in establishing the neuroanatomical and neurochemical pathology for specific cognitive deficits in a range of brain and behavior disorders.  In addition to providing equipment, training and consulting for researchers interested in using rodents as models to investigate disorders of brain and behavior, one important goal for the rodent behavioral core (RBC) is to continue to design and develop cutting edge behavioral methods and applications while maintaining facility resources at a high level of utility for users at all levels of expertise. This requires constant maintenance and calibration of equipment, user education and interaction, and commitment to setting the standard as the best Rodent Behavioral Core facility in the world in terms of research quality.  In the past year, the labs of several principal Investigators from NIMH, as well as NINDS, NIA, NIDCD, NHGRI, NICHD, NIDCD, and NICCH have used the RBC to conduct behavioral studies in an efficient and targeted manner. To date, the labs of 43 principal investigators have used the RBC facility with over 100 trainees that have been trained by the RBC staff in some capacity to use specific resources in the Core. Over the past year, we custom designed and developed new tasks to measure various aspects of behavior including providing options for users to assess certain emotional behaviors such as defensive reactions that were more ethologically grounded.  We have also instituted a mechanism to record ultrasonic vocalizations from groups of rodent families to measure social communication as an index of emotion.  Virtually every piece of equipment in the RBC including operant chambers, mazes and open testing arenas can be is integrated with transistortransistor logic (TTL) capability to interface with any TTL triggerable piece of equipment or software to enable optogenetic capability. The capability to conduct optogenetic studies in the RBC has made it an invaluable resource for many users who do not have the capability or resources to establish the infrastructure in their own labs. Most recently, we integrated methods of fiber photometry with spatial mazes, operant chambers, and tests of emotional memory to enable users the ability to obtain a more electrophysiological readout. Finaly, due to the high demand for rodent surgery, in the past year we upgraded the surgery suite with an additional Robotic stereotaxic frame to enable high throughout and precision microsurgical procedures. Together, these technical accomplishments have allowed users of the RBC to obtain an in-depth characterization of rodent behavior through modern, automated methods.  In addition to providing equipment resources, we have written custom code for several users to enable detailed levels of behavioral quantification or analyses for their experiments. For example, general motor activity data is usually indexed as duration and location of activity. With custom code, weve been able to provide researchers with additional measures such as speed of activity as well as visual patterns of the movement. For the future, our plan is to integrate observed behavior with high speed tracking using DeepLabCut, an open source code computer vision technique to accurately quantify behavior using a pose estimation of body parts. Its major advantage is that it allows the user to go directly from the data set creation to automatic behavioral analysis. It will also provide a means to standardize behavioral testing in an open-access manner so that data generated in the RBC can be shared between collaborators.  In the past fiscal year, the scientific supported provided by the NIMH RBC has contributed to several peer reviewed articles published in Nature (Brier et al), Nature Communications (Ono et al; Shen et al), Molecular Neurodegeneration (Chen et al), Cell Reports (Wu et al), eNeuro (Nordman et al), Journal of Neuroscience (Nordman et al), and Journal of Visual Experiments  (Zhan et al).

"Determinants of insufficient sleep among blacks and effects on disparities in health outcomes Project Summary Insufficient sleep (IS), stemming from sleep apnea, shift work, insomnia, working over 40 hr./week, unfavorable sleep environments and/or volitional reduction of bedtime, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers (elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and arterial stiffness), inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein) as well as with brain injury. Compelling evidence shows racial/ethnic disparities in insufficient sleep (IS), with blacks exhibiting a three-fold greater risk of IS relative to whites. Disparities might arise from physiologic and genetic factors, but recent evidence suggests environmental and psychosocial factors are also critical determinants. This study will utilize innovative dynamic modeling in a multi-level framework to delineate the psychosocial and environmental determinants (associative factors) of actigraphic IS and its putative associations with adverse health outcomes among blacks. Individual- and contextual-level data will be captured using novel home-based recordings and GIS data to model the environmental context where sleep occurs. The proposed study will leverage success of the NYU Sleep Disparity Workgroup led by Dr. Jean- Louis (PI), who has been conducting community-engaged sleep research for over 10 years. The workgroup comprises outstanding investigators with expertise in sleep and circadian rhythm, CVD, brain health, health disparities, translational behavioral medicine, and multi-level dynamic modeling. The study will benefit from experience of our standing Community Steering Committee, enabling recruitment of 560 blacks in various venues to participate in weeklong home studies to achieve proposed study aims. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify psychosocial (social support, discrimination, and attitudes/beliefs) and environmental (household [density, noise, light, and temperature], socioeconomic position, social capital, and neighborhood [built environment]) factors that are associated with IS; ascertain effects of IS on (a) markers of CVD (obesity, BP, lipid profile, and glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and on (b) markers of brain injury (tau, amyloid-β, neurofilament light, homocysteine, and glial fibrillary acidic protein; and develop profiles of blacks with IS-related adverse health outcomes using individual- and environmental-level data applying innovative multi-level dynamic modeling tools (Bayesia Belief Network and Agent-Based Simulation). This study will provide evidence to delineate factors underlying greater rates of IS among blacks and explain putative associations with markers of CVD, inflammation, and brain injury. These data will provide the foundation for longitudinal studies assessing causal effects of IS on these novel markers and interventions to mitigate adverse effects of IS on health outcomes. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that blacks exhibit a three-fold greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and brain injury. It will provide multi-level evidence on the impact of the psychosocial and environmental factors on insufficient sleep among blacks.

"Quantifying Exposure to Illicit Drugs & Psychosocial Stress in Real Time Assessment of episodes of drug use and psychosocial stress is complicated by the fact that each is often transient and difficult to recall accurately. Assessment of their causal connections with one another, and of their genetic and environmental determinants, is complicated by the complexity of the causal connections and by the elusive nature of what constitutes the environment. We are continuing our work to study the factors that influence drug use through collection of subjective, psychological and physiological measures, drug use and family histories, and environmental variables, including data about our participants neighborhoods and workplaces.   In this project, we are assessing drug use and psychosocial stress in near-real time through ecological momentary assessment (EMA), in which participants use handheld electronic diaries to record events as they occur and to report recent or ongoing events in response to randomly timed prompts throughout the day. We are also maintaining real-time records of where the reported events occur by collecting GPS data to track their whereabouts with a spatial resolution of several meters. We use these data collectively in a method we are calling geographical momentary assessment (GMA). Our goal with GMA has little to do with knowing the specific Baltimore locations where drug-related behaviors occur, and everything to do with gaining generalizable knowledge about how activity spaces (the spaces in which daily activities occur) are associated with such behaviors and their precipitants. We are currently analyzing GMA data from approximately 300 patients in opioid-agonist maintenance many of whom continue to use opioids and cocaine.    One goal of our research is to develop methods to determine when to deliver therapeutic content in just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) when users need it without making them trigger it with effortful input. We trained a randomForest algorithm to predict heroin craving, cocaine craving, or stress (reported on a smartphone three times per day) 90 min into the future, using 16 weeks of field data from 189 outpatients being treated for opioid-use disorder. We used only one form of continuous input (along with person-level demographic data), collected passively: an indicator of environmental exposures along the past 5 h of movement, as assessed by GPS. Our models achieved excellent overall accuracy-as high as 0.93 by the end of 16 weeks of tailoring-but this was driven mostly by correct predictions of absence. Positive predictive value (PPV) usually peaked in the high 0.70s toward the end of the 16 weeks. When the prediction target was more rare, PPV was lower. Our findings complement those of other investigators who use machine learning with more broadly based ""digital phenotyping"" inputs to predict or detect mental and behavioral events. When target events are comparatively subtle, like stress or drug craving, accurate detection or prediction probably needs effortful input from users, not passive monitoring alone. We also found that high overall accuracy (including high specificity) can mask the abundance of false alarms that low PPV reveals.  Among the measures collected in our project are sleep times and sleep quality. Sleep disturbance is common in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) receiving medication for addiction treatment, and differences between the effects of two primary agonist medications-methadone and buprenorphine-are not well understood. In patients receiving either methadone or buprenorphine treatment for OUD, we examined sleep continuity and architecture using ambulatory monitoring to gather both an objective measure for up to 7 days and a subjective measure of sleep. Patients treated with buprenorphine versus methadone did not differ on any measure of sleep continuity or architecture. Women had longer EEG-derived total sleep time than men, along with lower %N2 and greater %N3. Self-reported sleep differed from EEG-derived estimates: wake after sleep onset was greater by EEG than by diary, and total sleep time and sleep efficiency were lower by EEG than by diary. Patients treated with buprenorphine or methadone did not substantively differ in ambulatory measures of sleep. However, there was a discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep measures. Further confirmatory evidence would inform the development of sleep-related recommendations for OUD patients undergoing agonist treatment.  In addition to investigating possible effects of medications used in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) on sleep, we have investigated the effect of timing of medication visits.  Illicit opioids can also disrupt sleep, but it is unclear how they affect sleep in outpatients receiving OAT. Therefore, we used electronic diary entries and actigraphy to measure sleep duration and timing in opioid-dependent participants treated with methadone or buprenorphine. For 16 weeks, participants were assigned to attend our clinic under different operating hours in a crossover design: Early hours (07:00-09:00) vs. Late hours (12:00-13:00) for 4 weeks each in randomized order, followed for all participants by our Standard clinic hours (07:00-11:30) for 8 weeks. Throughout, participants made daily electronic diary self-reports of their sleep upon waking; they also wore a wrist actigraph for 6 nights in each of the three clinic-hour conditions. Drug use was assessed by thrice-weekly urinalysis. In linear mixed models controlling for other sleep-relevant factors, sleep duration and timing differed by drug use and by clinic hours. Compared to when non-using, participants slept less, went to bed later, and woke later when using illicit opioids and/or both illicit opioids and cocaine. Participants slept less and woke earlier when assigned to the Early hours. These findings highlight the role OAT clinic schedules can play in structuring the sleep/wake cycles of OAT patients and clarify some of the circumstances under which OAT patients experience sleep disruption in daily life.  Treatment with opioid agonists is effective for opioid use disorder, but early discontinuation of treatment is a major obstacle to success. We used our intensive longitudinal method of EMA to gain insight into the effects of stress, mood and craving on drug use while people are being treated and investigate the processes that lead people to drop out of treatment.  EMA was conducted for up to 17 weeks by obtaining multiple electronic diary entries per day from 238 participants being treated with methadone or buprenorphine. Survival analysis was used to study two outcomes: dropping out of treatment and noncompliance with EMA self-report requirements. Self-reports of stress, craving, and mood were used as time-varying predictors. Demographic and psychosocial variables measured with the Addiction Severity Index at the start of treatment were used as time-invariant predictors. Dropping out of treatment was more likely in participants with more reported hassles (a measure of stress), higher levels of cocaine craving, lower levels of positive mood, a recent history of emotional abuse, a recent history of being bothered frequently by psychological problems, and with buprenorphine rather than methadone as their medication. In contrast, study noncompliance was not significantly associated with any of the variables analyzed.  Our results suggest that assessment of stress, craving and mood during treatment might identify people who are at greater risk of dropping out, and therapeutic interventions targeting these processes might increase retention.  Cocaine use in clinical treatment trials is often measured via self-report, which can be inaccurate, or urine drug screens, which can be intrusive and burdensome. Devices that can automatically detect cocaine use and can be worn conveniently in daily life may provide seve n/a",Quantifying Exposure to Illicit Drugs & Psychosocial Stress in Real Time,10267529,ZIADA000499,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Architecture', 'Baltimore', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cocaine', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Heroin', 'Hour', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Survival Analysis', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'cocaine use', 'comparative', 'craving', 'diaries', 'digital', 'drug craving', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'illicit opioid', 'indexing', 'insight', 'men', 'meter', 'methadone treatment', 'non-compliance', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'positive mood', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sleep onset', 'sleep quality', 'success', 'treatment trial']",NIDA,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,ZIA,2020,1201459,0.028504691959570724
"CRCNS: Unsupervised Learning of Hippocampal Sequence Dynamic in Sleep   In unit recordings from large populations of neurons, fast compressed sequential firing of neurons during rest and early sleep have been found to replay patterns first observed in active awake experience. These remarkable patterns have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community and beyond. Sequence  replay is now considered to play a critical role in the long-term stabilization and storage of mnemonically  important information. However, despite the general acknowledgement of the importance of the sequential structure, very little is known about the null background against which replay is compared. Specifically, are apparently 'non-replaying' spike patterns, as seen in late sleep, just simply noise? Because replay is typically assessed by comparison against a fixed known template, most methods can only determine whether the resemblance to the template is more than what might be expected from  random spike trains. But these methods cannot appraise whether other patterns remain in the nonsignificant events. Recently, the Diba and Kemere labs successfully collaborated to address precisely  this issue. We developed methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) to uncover temporal structure in spike trains of neurons in an unsupervised template-free manner. In this proposal, we aim to further improve these methods and to evaluate the hidden structure of spike trains in hippocampal  neuronal populations during sleep. In our second specific aim, we will use HMMs to determine both co-active ensemble (""contextual"") and temporal patterns (""sequential"") structure in hippocampal spike trains in both pre- and post-task sleep. In the third specific aim, we will probe the essence of sleep replay further, by exposing animals to multiple novel and familiar maze environments prior to long durations of sleep. In the fourth specific aim, we will perform closed-loop disruption of neuronal population patterns to  examine the causal interplay and reverberation of these patterns from early to late sleep. In summary, our  proposal is designed to provide strongest characterization to date of the structure of ""noise"" in replay events. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This study will provide an opening to evaluate the role of sleep in reorganizing information in the brain and  help to identify critical time windows and neuronal activities during sleep which are particularly important  for information storage and stabilization. Our assumptions and deductions about the nature and purpose  of sleep implicitly inform all manner of public policy, from the durations of shifts for hospital and relief  workers, to morning start times of public schools.

"Motor Activity Research Consortium for Health (mMarch) There is growing interest in studying the environmental, biologic and genetic correlates of the components of motor activity as well as the relationships between motor activity with sleep, exercise, mood, and cognitive functioning. Aggregation of the findings across studies is challenged by the substantial differences in both the study goals, procedures and statistical methods. Therefore, mMARCH seeks greater coordination across studies in the procedures and analytic methods of functional data associated with mood and other disorders.   We have devoted the past year to analyses of the findings of the actigraphy and electronic diary, and their combination. We have used multiple analytic approaches to characterize the actigraphy data including generalized estimating equations, mixed models, functional principal components analysis, and function on scalar regression models. In addition, our colleagues at Johns Hopkins University have developed a new method called Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE) that provides a framework for analyzing multi-domain data by decomposing the data into low-rank approximation.   In the last year, we collaborated across the network to publish several papers related to motor-activity monitoring. As part of the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (BD) Chronobiology Task Force, we recently published a review of circadian constructs and their measurement in BD research, to enable researchers and clinicians to make pragmatic decisions about their use (Murray et al, 2020). We also continued to promote the use of mobile and wearable technologies through publishing reviews and commentaries that demonstrate their scientific value (Sequeira et al, 2019; Sequeira et al, 2020) as well as collaborated across the network to promote shared methods including an intervention study of the youth with treatment resistant depression (J Strauss, U of Toronto) and a rhythms-based treatment of youth at risk for suicide (Blumberg et al, Yale University School of Medicine). We also joined forces with collaborators at the Netherlands and CoLaus sites to employ the processing and statistical methods that we have developed to pursue study specific hypotheses, and we published key findings on sleep and activity rhythms among people with major depression in the NESDA site in the Netherlands (Difrancesco et al, 2019). Results demonstrated the importance of including objective assessments in studies of behavioral rhythms, as we were able to capture differences in physical activity and circadian rhythm using actigraphy that were not captured by self-report measures. We also completed data analyses on the associations between objective measures of sleep and activity among CoLaus participants with cardiovascular reactivity and mood disorders. Findings revealed the importance of BMI and smoking as confounders of these associations, and differences in physical activity and sleep features among those with the current but not lifetime atypical subtype of depression. Analyses of objectively assessed sleep and activity in offspring of parents with BD by our Hong Kong colleagues showed different clinical and sleep and activity patterns in high risk vs low risk offspring, as well as different patterns pre and post puberty.  We have also done extensive analyses of the electronic-diary data using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and actigraphy. This work has primarily been focused on data from the NIMH Family Study. However, we have also analyzed data from the Brisbane Twin Study, the Australian BMRI and the two Swiss studies (Lausanne Family Study and CoLaus/PsyCoLaus). Our analytic group continues to provide instructive webinars that inform mMARCH site investigators on the procedures for processing, setting up data sets and conducting analyses of the GENEActiv actigraphy data. For analytical purposes, we developed a post GGIR R package to examine, summarize and generate a comprehensive report from the GGIR output of acceloremeter data. In the last year this package has been widely used in the mMARCH Consortium. We have completed analyses of the associations between mood, sleep and cortisol slope, and the effects of anxiety, stress, and sleep on incident headaches using EMA real time data. We have also shown that people with social anxiety disorder have higher levels of depressed mood than those with other anxiety or mood disorders, and greater reactivity to daily stressors.    Public Health Impact: The formation of the mMARCH initiative will enable groups to efficiently share and combine data to learn more about how activity affects different disorders and diseases across many populations, including mood disorders, sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, genetic studies, emotion, eating, and other disorders that impact public health. This work will also define targets for prevention and intervention studies.  Future Plans: Plans for the next year include expanding the network using the common procedures of actigraphy and EMA to include more sites that can conduct common data analyses, continued development of analytic models including multi-level dynamic models of intensive repeated measures data, and machine learning approaches that classify the structure of inter-relationships among the regulatory domains under investigation. We will also report the findings of our analyses of several projects that investigate the heritability of actigraphy phenotypes and their associations with clinical and health measures in the NIMH and CoLaus family studies, and genetic association studies of these phenotypes in the CoLaus cohort. We will focus on five major activities: 1) joint analysis of the mMARCH core group data including the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus study of comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease, the NESDA study in the Netherlands, the Australian studies of twin and youth with emerging mood disorders, and the Hong Kong circadian rhythms study; 2) follow up of the NIMH Family Study and CoLaus/PsyCoLaus samples to investigate the stability of the findings from the first wave of participation; 3) addition of several sites with actigraphy data in both adults and youth with BD; 4) initiation of new studies of youth in seven sites (miniMARCH collaboration); and 5) development of translational studies to identify the regulatory systems underlying motor activity and sleep across species. Additionally, we are creating a mMARCH website for both the general public and professionals, in order to share the findings and to exchange procedures, methods, analytic approaches and programs, and literature. n/a",Motor Activity Research Consortium for Health (mMarch),10266627,ZIAMH002954,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Adolescent', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Australia', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chinese People', 'Chronobiology Disorders', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Eating', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotions', 'Equation', 'Exercise', 'Family Study', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Headache', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Hong Kong', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motor Activity', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Netherlands', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Queensland', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Smoking', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Switzerland', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'anxiety spectrum disorders', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'brain research', 'circadian', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbid depression', 'data management', 'diaries', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'offspring', 'physical conditioning', 'programs', 'sleep pattern', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'translational study', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'wearable device', 'web site', 'webinar', 'young adult']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2020,967587,0.028344825394174995
"A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Tobacco smoking among women in Romania increased dramatically, by close to 30%, between 2011-2018 and the share of smokers with quit attempts decreased by 37%. Tobacco kills more than 8 million people a year around the world. The burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Romania, where 80% of the worldwide 1.1 billion smokers live. Our work showed that 30% of women smoke pre-pregnancy in Romania and half of the smokers continue during pregnancy. It is critically important to address tobacco smoking during pregnancy, an extraordinary window of opportunity for sustained cessation. The objectives of this application are to develop, implement, and test the feasibility and effectiveness of an adaptive mobile pregnancy tobacco cessation app-based intervention using deep tailoring and a self-nominated support person, and to build mHealth research capacity in Romania. We build on our pregnancy smoking cessation trials with spousal support in Romania, including the ongoing Smoke Free Together (SFT1.0) mHealth pilot trial and the Quit Together telephone counseling trial that shows preliminary evidence of efficacy, and on our partnerships in Romania. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will show evidence of feasibility and effectiveness in increasing positive support, pregnancy cessation, and postnatal abstinence. The app will be novel in its use of the unique functionality of smartphones, use of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep tailoring to continuously adapt the intervention, the emphasis on increasing positive support, and the use of the app by both smoker and quit-partner. The aims are: 1. (R21 phase). Develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the SFT2.0 app-based mobile smoking cessation intervention with quit-partner support during pregnancy and postpartum in Romania; 2. (R33 phase). Test the SFT2.0 app-based smoking cessation intervention in a hybrid effectiveness and implementation randomized controlled trial; 3. (R21 and R33 phases). Develop mHealth research capacity by enhancing individual and institutional research capabilities in Romania and expanding the existing international research network. With respect to expected outcomes, the proposed application is anticipated to advance understanding of the effectiveness and implementation of a smartphone-based app for pregnancy smoking cessation with quit- partner support. Such results are anticipated to have a system wide sustainable positive impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal smoking as the intervention has a high potential to be adopted in the universal health system in Romania, with applications to the US and other populations. The development of the international research network and the individual and institutional mHealth research capacity building is expected to positively impact mHealth research in CEE and the neighboring region. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the findings will have a system wide sustainable impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking in Romania and in Central and Eastern Europe, with applications to the US and other populations. The research is also expected to have an important impact on the methodology and design of mobile technology clinical and public health interventions during the reproductive years with lifelong potential implications.

"The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay Project Summary The hippocampus is a critical site for rapid memory formation and retrieval, with extensively documented functions representing spatial and navigational variables, yet less is known of the means by which it guides behavior. Bursts of hippocampal activity identified in many species as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are promising neural mechanisms to link hippocampal activity and behavioral function, since during SWRs hippocampus can represent positions the animal previously experienced, or will traverse in the near future. This proposal considers the food-caching behaviors of chickadees, who use a hippocampal-dependent, one- shot memory to guide cache retrieval. This behavior is exceptionally promising to link hippocampal activity to individual experiences, which has been a barrier to determining the nature of representations during SWR and their function in previous studies. These studies will develop a comprehensive account of how chickadee behavior is affected by cache site memory, determine whether SWRs are related to memory-specific components of caching behavior, and determine whether SWRs represent individual cache sites to assist later retrieval. I hypothesize that memory-guided behavior is distinguishable from random foraging. I will use video tracking to measure the behavioral microstructure of chickadee caching behavior, including postural and gaze time series, and develop quantitative models of behavioral motifs and their temporal structure. Using these tools to compare memory-guided and random foraging behaviors, I will develop decoders that indicate precisely how and when behavior appears memory-guided. I hypothesize that SWRs occur more often, and are more predictive of behavior, when behavior is memory- guided. I will use electrophysiology in freely moving chickadees during caching to relate SWRs to the microstructural analysis of behavior and decoding of behavioral strategy. I hypothesize that SWRs reactivate representations of previous, individual caching events, and that this reactivation improves subsequent retrieval for that individual site. Using electrophysiological recordings in caching birds, I will relate reactivations to the accuracy of retrieval behavior. Using online SWR detection and suppression, I will further determine if SWRs causally affect later retrieval behavior. Project Narrative Food caching birds are a unique model system for dissecting the fundamental principles of hippocampal function. Thorough characterization and computational modeling of this behavior, and the specific contribution of hippocampal memory, will allow insight into the neural mechanisms by which hippocampal representations guide behavior. We expect the principles resulting from this study to illuminate dysfunctions of memory present in many neurological disorders.",The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay,9991327,F32MH123015,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Future', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Series', 'Site', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'way finding']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,73106,-0.014851944633025757
"Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias This fast track SBIR application submitted by Advanced Medical Electronics Corp. requests funds to develop a software system that helps people living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, and other dementia to age in place and give them the choice whether and when to move. Staying at home is both preferred and less expensive, but there are a number of challenges to overcome. The proposed social interactive interface (SII), which uses augmented intelligence to both converse with the target demographic in natural language and analyze data from “Internet of Things” devices, will address these challenges by relieving problem behaviors and caregiver burden; increasing medication adherence; and reducing depression, social isolation, hospitalizations due to dehydration and urinary tract infections, thereby reducing the overall cost of care. The SII will learn behavioral trends and determine whether activities of daily living are completed. When unusual behavior is detected, it will alert the caregiver. If the SII determines a behavior problem may occur, then it will provide a just-in-time psychosocial intervention (e.g., reminisce therapy). Finally, the SII will keep schedules, provide reminders of upcoming events, and alerts when events are missed. AME will partner with SimpleC. In phase 1, we will prototype the social interactive interface and evaluate its feasibility. In phase 2, we will develop the social interactive interface, integrate it with the SimpleC platform, and evaluate its efficacy. Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases, and they cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed. Exploiting aspects of Cloud-based computing, SimpleC has developed an assistive technology tool based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver a non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and QOL in persons living with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s, and other dementia. To help these people age in place, AME is partnering with SimpleC to create a software solution that will address the needs of those aging in place.","Automated Social Interactive Interface to Monitor and Update Intervention Plans for People with MCI, Alzheimer's  and Other Dementias",10002162,R44AG057364,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Calendar', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive aging', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'care costs', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motion sensor', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'prevent', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychoeducational', 'psychosocial', 'sensor', 'social', 'software systems', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2020,710559,-0.034183620733492986
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10092402,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2020,830874,-0.008362839923397382
"Robust circuit computation in freely behaving animals. Project Summary/Abstract Sleep is necessary for all brain function and ultimately life. The core function by which sleep contributes to healthy cognition remains one of the great questions facing neuroscience. Recent theories point to powerful cellular rules, but these are controversial and have difficulty accounting for the effects of sleep in ethologically and developmentally diverse circumstances. We recently showed that cortical circuit dynamics are actively tuned to criticality, a computational regime that maximizes information processing. This regime is disrupted by changes in synaptic strength, such as those believed to typify waking experience. This raises the intriguing possibility that the core mechanism by which sleep benefits neural function is by restoring criticality. Our preliminary experiments support this hypothesis. The overall goal of this project is to develop a new framework for understanding the neural impact of sleep and experience at the level of network dynamics. We will continuously track 500-1000 single neurons in the brains of freely behaving animals for up to six months. We will track sleep, wake, behavior, and neural dynamics across the entire distribution of naturally occurring behavior. We will take advantage of this methodologically integrated approach to understand how circuits in the brain maintain the stable computation necessary for cognition and natural behavior on long time-scales. In Aim 1, we will test the relationship between specific classes of behavior and criticality in underlying networks. In Aim 2, we will test the impact of wake and sleep on criticality across the brain for the majority of an animal's lifetime. In Aim 3, we will use a modelling-based approach to establish the mechanisms of criticality in the intact brain. The results of this work will shed light on a long-standing gap in our knowledge of fundamental neurobiology. Given the increasingly recognized role of sleep in a vast number of brain-related disorders, an understanding of how sleep works will open the door to significant health-related progress in the future. This work directly advances the mission of the BRAIN Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Sleep is vitally important for brain function and survival, yet its core process remains one of the most poorly understood features of life.

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9840897,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual response', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2020,118650,0.042331081978737396
"A comparison of firearm-related intimate partner homicide in Texas and Maryland: Prevalence, identification of those at risk, and the effect of firearm regulations Intimate partner homicide (IPH) accounts for one-fifth of U.S. homicides, with the majority of IPH and nearly all (91.6%) of intimate-partner related homicide-suicides (IPH-S) committed by firearms. While much is known about the frequency by which IPH is committed by firearms, research is far more limited regarding how victim/perpetrator firearm access, ownership, and behaviors affect IPH and IPH-S risk. We propose a case-control study in two states (Maryland and Texas) chosen to provide robust interstate firearm comparisons, as well as demographic, geographic and relevant law diversity. We will collect case file (medical examiner, police, prosecutor) and interview data to compare the histories of IPH victims (cases) to those of a random sample of individuals who experienced non-fatal physical IPV in the past two years (controls). The study will accomplish the following: (1) Obtain a count of firearm-related IPH and IPH-S across multiple subgroups through triangulation of data from multiple sources; (2) Describe the context of IPH and IPH-S, including precipitating events, relationship history, and perpetrator characteristics such as prior suicidality and prior substance abuse; (3) Assess the strength of firearm access, ownership, and/or use as risk factors for IPH and IPH-S, attending to intersections with risk factors at the family (e.g., abuse history), community (e.g., community violence), social and environmental levels (e.g., state firearm policies, accessibility of social services); (4) Identify differential patterns of risk between firearm-related and non-firearm related IPH, and between firearm-related IPH and IPH-S; (5) Examine patterns of gun ownership behaviors and attitudes in relation to IPH and IPH-S. We will create a database that will combine data across current data collection endeavors, creating a foundation for future funding. Findings will inform future evidence-based, multiple-level prevention interventions and allow policy makers and practitioners to develop and refine risk-informed approaches to reduce and prevent lethal IPV outcomes.

"Neural basis of smoking relapse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden. Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a quit attempt. To improve quit rates significantly, we need a more refined mechanistic understanding of why so many smokers who attempt to quit will relapse quickly. The proposed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study integrates concepts and tools from the fields of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science to determine how brain states in early abstinence influence clinical outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers. The primary aims of this hypothesis-driven study are: (1) to identify brain mechanisms that increase vulnerability to smoking relapse, and (2) to test an integrated brain-behavior model of smoking relapse. Using our validated fMRI-based abstinence challenge paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre- treatment fMRI scans: after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. We will examine neural and behavioral responses during performance of validated tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity, and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6-months to assess time (days) to relapse, using a validated smoking relapse protocol. The primary outcome is time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include abstinence symptoms and smoking status at 30 days. For human subjects reasons, relapsing smokers will be offered an opportunity to receive 8 weeks of nicotine patch treatment and counseling free of charge following study completion. Although neuroimaging is not likely to become a standard pre- cessation assessment the near future, this study will elucidate pathological neurobehavioral processes and specific neurocognitive domains that can be targeted in new treatments to aid smoking cessation.

"Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control 7. Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading major cause of preventable death in the United States, and cigarette smoking is a contributor to lung cancer in 80%–90% of cases. Though adult cigarette smoking rates have declined substantially during the past 50 years, they remain as high as 30% in certain groups, such as individuals living in poverty. Quitting is difficult: a given quit attempt results in cessation in fewer than 10% of cases, and most adult cigarette smokers have attempted and failed to quit, and often many times. What is urgently needed are novel interventions for cigarette smoking cessation that operate through different mechanisms from those targeted by existing interventions, which are likely to have been unsuccessful for persistent smokers. A barrier to progress is that the mechanisms of action of most treatments are not known, which makes it difficult to know which treatment will work best for whom. We turn to affective science to identify a candidate technique that could serve as the basis for a novel intervention. Research on affect regulation typically focuses on down- regulation of affective states, such as craving for cigarettes, using effortful strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. However, a new insight in affect regulation is that people can construe, or subjectively understand, events with varying levels of abstraction, and that construing health-related behaviors in high- versus low-level terms promotes health behavior in several domains. For example, smokers who want to quit are more likely to resist a cigarette when they construe the same event (e.g., “abstinence”) in more abstract, high-level terms (e.g., “becoming a better me”) versus more concrete, low-level terms (e.g., “not smoking this cigarette”). There is some evidence that high-level construal might rely on distinct mechanisms from traditional affect regulation and smoking reduction interventions, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Directly comparing its mechanisms to those of alternative affect regulation strategies and developing tools to induce high-level construal are the next steps on the path toward developing a novel intervention. Also, establishing individual differences in the effects of high-level construal will allow future interventions to be targeted to the individuals for whom they will be maximally effective. We identified two candidate mechanisms through which high-level construal might operate: down-regulation of craving and up-regulation of goal energization (i.e., motivation to quit). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed the neural systems engaged by those processes to be distinct. So, we will use multivariate analyses of fMRI data to quantify the similarity of high-level construal to each candidate (Aim 1). This will be done in a longitudinal translational experiment with 4 conditions—high- level construal, down-regulation of craving, up-regulation of goal energization, and treatment-as-usual—in a sample of persistent smokers in poverty, who are the most likely to benefit from a novel, theory-based treatment. The sample size (N = 240) affords an examination of individual differences in the effect of high-level construal on neural activity and craving, and the degree to which they predict smoking reduction (Aim 2). 8. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking is among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States because smoking increases risk for lung cancer and various diseases. Though U.S. smoking rates have declined, a substantial percentage of adults, particularly those living in poverty who have repeatedly tried and failed to quit, still smoke and therefore could benefit from novel interventions for cessation that operate through different mechanisms than those of traditional treatments. This study will use neuroimaging to uncover the mechanisms of action of a promising strategy for affect regulation and smoking cessation and also build profiles of individuals for whom this strategy does and does not work, thereby providing tangible and practical information that public health professionals and clinicians can use to inform personalized treatments for cigarette smoking cessation.",Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control,9909179,R01CA240452,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medial', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cost', 'craving', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'insight', 'lens', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'preventable death', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,610247,-0.0012908343537480784
"Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology Abstract  In the U.S., Latina women report higher rates of inactivity than their non-Hispanic White and male counterparts, and are disproportionately affected by related health conditions (e.g., cancer, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes). To address this public health crisis, evidence-based interventions that utilize state- of-the-art technology, theory and methods are needed to increase physical activity (PA) among this high-risk population. Recently, our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (N=205) to test the efficacy of a culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-language Internet-based PA intervention among Latinas (Pasos Hacia La Salud, R01CA159954) vs. a Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Although results were promising, the majority of participants still did not meet national guidelines for PA. In the ongoing renewal of R01CA159954, we will randomize 300 Latina women to either 1) the original Pasos Hacia La Salud tailored Internet-based PA intervention (Original Intervention) or 2) the data driven, enhanced version of the Pasos Hacia La Salud PA intervention (Enhanced Intervention).  The proposed supplement seeks to become the first trial to examine longitudinal patterns of PA adoption and maintenance across a series of longitudinal studies among Latinas. Traditional analytic methods would compare findings across studies and would estimate intervention effects at end of treatment controlling for baseline. We propose to use Integrative Data Analysis to combine data across studies and Latent Class Models to identifies patterns of PA adoption and maintenance. By using Latent Class Modeling (LCM), we will make full use of the longitudinal profile of PA data to identify patterns of change over time. LCMs use objective data (rather than a priori hypotheses) to subdivide the population into distinct groups of participants with similar profiles (of PA changes in this case). LCM can not only capture between- and within-subject heterogeneity, but can aid in the identification of meaningful subgroups within the population. By using this innovative method, we will not only reveal the inter-variability of PA over time but also elucidate the associations between such patterns and key psychosocial, behavioral and demographic predictors. Project Narrative Latinas exhibit high rates of inactivity and related chronic health conditions (including some cancers, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension), and are therefore in need of culturally and linguistically adapted physical activity interventions. The proposed supplement will build on the aims of the parent and renewal studies by using integrative data analysis to identify patterns of change in objectively measured physical activity over time, and test how these patterns relate to participant-level characteristics, including demographics, psychosocial and physiological predictors.",Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology,9764734,R01CA159954,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Endometrial', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Latina', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'burden of illness', 'cancer risk', 'data reduction', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'exercise intervention', 'group intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'longitudinal dataset', 'male', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'post intervention', 'protective effect', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social culture', 'success', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigorous intensity']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,216895,0.036105833237738215
"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,10011784,R01CA234539,"['12 year old', '17 year old', '18 year old', '20 year old', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Categories', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diffusion', 'Education', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Escalator', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Smoke-free home', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Status', 'Structural Models', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'aged', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparison group', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health data', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nicotine use', 'nicotine user', 'peer', 'prognostic', 'rate of change', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco user', 'young adult']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,312701,0.013451117178010617
"Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients Multiple studies have shown that some patients who remain behaviorally unresponsive after severe brain damage can modulate their brain activity in response to command. A lack of response to the command- following paradigm in other patients, however, cannot be taken as evidence that consciousness is absent. There is thus an urgent need for neuroimaging tools that are able to diagnose covert consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive subjects without relying on a task. Previous neuroimaging studies of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) have mostly utilized between-state paradigms (e.g., wakefulness vs. sleep) or report-based contrasts, which conflate differences in brain activity supporting consciousness with differences in brain activity supporting behavior or task response. To address these limitations, my sponsor (Dr. Giulio Tononi) has developed a within-state, no-report paradigm that uses serial awakenings to contrast states of consciousness versus unconsciousness during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. Using high density electroencephalography (EEG), his group has shown that the occurrence of dreaming consciousness during sleep is associated with a reduction of delta activity (sleep slow waves) in a posterior cortical ‘hot zone’ encompassing occipital, parietal and temporal cortices. To proceed towards clinical applications, it is now essential to confirm and extend these findings using combined EEG-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). To this effect, in an important new development, Dr. Tononi and collaborators have recently shown that it is possible to faithfully track EEG slow wave activity during sleep by means of a high-frequency (~0.17 Hz) blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) oscillation evident in fMRI. This finding provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the NCCs during sleep with high spatial resolution, avoiding potential pitfalls of EEG source modeling, and with unrestricted access to subcortical structures. Taking advantage of these new findings, in this project, I propose to combine the novel fMRI signature of sleep slow waves with a serial awakenings paradigm to locate the NCCs during sleep. Specifically, I will acquire fMRI-EEG data during ~1,080 awakenings from sleep across 40 healthy subjects and investigate the neural correlates of the presence versus absence of dreaming consciousness (Aim 1). I hypothesize that high-frequency BOLD oscillation—which tracks sleep slow-waves—will show regional decreases in specific posterior cortical areas during dreaming compared to dreamless sleep. In Aim 2, I will use univariate and multivariate modeling approaches based on high-frequency BOLD power and conventional BOLD amplitude to identify the NCCs of specific dream contents (e.g., presence of faces) and complexity. If successful, the proposed experiments will constitute an important step forward in identifying brain regions that sustain consciousness and its contents during behaviorally unresponsive states. These results can open new avenues to improve clinical care in patients with a DOC and inform the assessment of intraoperative awareness in anesthetized subjects. Due to previous methodological oversights that confounded consciousness and behavior, the neural substrates of covert consciousness in unresponsive states are poorly understood. The current project will use serial awakenings with dream reports combined with a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signature of sleep slow waves to identify the neural correlates of both the presence of consciousness and its contents during sleep, a physiological unresponsive state. The goal is to help clarify a scientific controversy surrounding the neural basis of consciousness at an unprecedented spatial resolution and with an access to subcortical structures, which could ultimately to improve diagnosis through neuroimaging and clinical care for patients with disorders of consciousness.",Novel fMRI Strategy to Assess Consciousness in Brain-Injured Patients,10053237,F32NS114034,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Board Certification', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Consciousness Disorders', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dreams', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Occipital lobe', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vegetative States', 'Wakefulness', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain research', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'life-sustaining therapy', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'stimulus processing', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2020,67626,0.0112869029952569
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9985596,R01CA190329,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Breathing', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Cigarette', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Geography', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inhalation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'arm movement', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'built environment', 'cigarette smoke', 'cigarette smoking', 'cigarette user', 'data to knowledge', 'experience', 'field study', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'population health', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'uptake', 'wearable sensor technology', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,582564,0.026148257450143906
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9934148,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2020,2195573,0.016900457370497345
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,9732635,K24NR015812,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient oriented research', 'pedometer', 'physical model', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social media', 'tool', 'training opportunity']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2020,183406,0.027871915899756867
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.

"A non-pharmacological multi-modal therapy to improve sleep and cognition and reduce mild cognitive impairment risk Summary Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare with non-pharmacological interventions that use the science of behavior change and new Internet of Things (IoT) devices to augment clinical treatment. When you go to the doctor of the future, instead of prescribing a drug, in many cases the doctor may prescribe a software intervention guiding the patient through a process of facilitated behavior change and environmental optimization. This software approach to healthcare addresses the high-priority of providing services to individuals with limited/no access to care and for addressing the public health issues of insomnia and conversion to Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). These diseases are thought to cost the US Healthcare system more than $400 billion/year, with another $400 billion/year cost to U.S. businesses in lost productivity, sick days, and accidents. In our Phase I, we were the first research group to show that non-phase locked auditory stimulation can improve next day performance on attention measures without adversely impacting sleep organization, quality, or total sleep time. Our acoustic intervention increased the percentage and intensity of slow-wave sleep (SWS), the stage of sleep with many regenerative properties and which typically decreases with age. We have additional preliminary evidence that this sound-based intervention, played at the right time and volume during sleep, can enhance next day memory performance. Due to the accumulating support demonstrating the role that sleep quality and SWS play in conversion to MCI and AD from imaging studies, longitudinal studies, and cognitive assessments, our intervention may address both the public health issue of poor sleep quality and AD. In our Phase II, we propose to further address insomnia and AD risk by integrating our deep sleep enhancement intervention and sound masking intervetinos with additional IoT devices, such as the FitBit, Apple Watch, and Oura Ring for more accurately measuring sleep and delivering sleep improvement enhancements, such as smart light bulbs to entrain and strengthen circadian rhythms, and Amazon's Alexa to deliver relaxation interventions and reminders to address compliance. The developed software will include a sleep diary with all relevant sleep statistics viewable by a trained therapist in the gold standard treatment for insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi). Displaying this data to the clinician can be used to deliver more personalized interventions and increase compliance with the treatment. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial on 65+ aged healthy individuals in an independent living facility that have symptoms for insomnia and compare our enhanced type of CBTi integrated with new IoT technology to typical CBTi and a passive control of sleep hygiene therapy. We hypothesize that our intervention is just as effective as the gold standard treatment for insomnia of CBTi as measured by sleep efficiency on a sleep diary (primary outcome). The system may also have the additional benefit of improving next day cognitive performance (secondary outcome), a meaningful indicator of cognitive decline and AD risk. Exploratory analyses further test the effects of the intervention on a neurodegeneration biomarker panel and additional cognitive performance measures. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop an improved multi-modal and non-pharmacological intervention to reduce conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and reduce Alzheimer's Disease (AD) risk in a 65+ population with symptoms of insomnia. We improve sleep, a known risk factor for cognitive decline, AD, and neurodegeneration biomarkers by combining acoustic deep sleep stimulation with Internet of Things device to augment the sleep environment and a system for improving cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) that leverages big-data. We will run a randomized clinical trial on 100 people over an 8- week period to validate this technology. The primary outcome is sleep efficiency measured on a sleep diary, the typical measure of insomnia in clinical settings. The secondary outcome is cognitive decline measures of memory, executive functioning, and attention. Exploratory measures are additional cognitive tasks and biomarkers that are sensitive to MCI and ADRD. A successful project would yield a new, non- addictive, cheap, and accessible intervention to address insomnia and reduce conversion to MCI / ADRD.",A non-pharmacological multi-modal therapy to improve sleep and cognition and reduce mild cognitive impairment risk,10010093,R44AG056250,"['Accidents', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Apple watch', 'Arizona', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Businesses', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Comorbid Insomnia', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypertension', 'Illness Days', 'Impaired cognition', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Study', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Insomnia', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sales', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Solid', 'Sonication', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'abeta deposition', 'actigraphy', 'active method', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'beta amyloid pathology', 'biomarker panel', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'diaries', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'human old age (65+)', 'hypnotic', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improvement on sleep', 'intervention effect', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'post intervention', 'primary outcome', 'randomized placebo controlled trial', 'regenerative', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'sleep health', 'sleep quality', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'tau Proteins']",NIA,"PROACTIVE LIFE, INC.",R44,2020,1243520,-0.015998040493657974
