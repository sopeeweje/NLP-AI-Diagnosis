"Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents, and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBank's depth and breadth makes it an ideal data source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties. Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other databases. ! Project Narrative Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics and reagents are discovered and developed.!",Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database,9847841,R44GM117961,"['Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Meteor', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'data submission', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'peer', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,"PROTABIT, LLC",R44,2019,990318,0.09067386553607161
"Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs Project Summary Eukaryotic cells have diverse cellular components, including subcellular organelles and sub-organelle compartments. The accurate targeting of proteins to these cellular components is crucial in establishing and maintaining cellular organizations and functions. Mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. However, the vast majority of proteins lack subcellular/sub-organelle localization annotation. Compared with experimental methods, computational prediction of protein localization provides an efficient and effective way for proteome annotation and experimental design. The current prediction tools for protein localization have significant room for improvement. In addition, no tool can predict localization at the sub- organelle resolution or internal localization signals. Deep learning, as the cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new opportunity for this classical bioinformatics problem. The availability of recent high- throughput localization data can also train deep learning well. The PI’s lab has demonstrated some success on a special case, i.e., predicting mitochondrial localizations for plants using deep learning.  In this project, the PI proposes to develop new methods and a standalone toolkit for accurate and scalable protein localization prediction at the subcellular and sub-organelle levels, as well as for characterization of localization motifs (including novel internal motifs). The general approach is to design a semi-supervised deep- learning method that utilizes both annotated protein sequences with known localization and unannotated protein sequences as training data. Through the realization of an unsupervised deep-learning approach, a general representation of protein sequences will be implemented, characterizing both local and global features of protein sequences. By visualizing and characterizing the deep-learning models, novel, interpretable protein sequence patterns will be predicted as putative targeting peptides and compared with known localization signals. We will also use the methods to be developed and the unsupervised models to be trained on all protein sequences as a general framework for other sequence-based prediction problems that predict the label of a protein and the key residues contributing to the label. We will make the platform highly customizable and apply it to three applications, including ubiquitination protein prediction, enzyme EC number prediction, and protein family/subfamily classification. The innovative contributions to protein sequence-based analyses and predictions include: (1) using raw amino acid sequences as training inputs without feature engineering; (2) utilizing the huge amount of unannotated data in an unsupervised deep learning to characterize a general protein feature representation; (3) identifying potential targeting signals (especially internal motifs) by decoding the trained deep- learning models, augmented with sophisticated attention mechanisms; 4) detecting multiple-organelle targeting and sub-organelle localizations by a novel hierarchical multi-label architecture; and (5) combining features from different data sources by a multiplicative fused CNN model. Relevance to Public Health  A protein typically has a well-defined localization in a cell to perform its function, and mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. Protein localization prediction can provide valuable information for understanding disease mechanisms and designing treatment. To address the limitations of current computational methods, this project will apply cutting-edge deep-learning methods to deliver new computational methods and tools with improved accuracy and detailed sub-organelle prediction for protein localization.",Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs,9768571,R21LM012790,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Experimental Designs', 'Generations', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'N-terminal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nobel Prize', 'Organelles', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Plants', 'Protein Family', 'Protein translocation', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'recurrent neural network', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2019,205330,0.13053470699732583
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research. This project will develop and apply cutting-edge deep- learning methods to deliver various sequence-based computational tools for gaining new knowledge, accelerating drug development, and improving personalized diagnosis and treatment.",Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction,9691995,R35GM126985,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Plug-in', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'drug development', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'online resource', 'open source', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'software systems', 'supervised learning', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2019,378183,0.06463239865545357
"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9731549,R01GM124559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'random forest', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,384166,0.11457715609186898
"Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT About 1500 of the ~20,000 protein-coding genes of the human genome can bind drug-like molecules, and yet only about 600 are currently targeted by FDA-approved drugs. Therefore, at least 930 proteins are potential drug targets that are not yet being utilized for human medicine and, given our incomplete state of knowledge about the human genome, the actual number could be much higher. There is therefore a substantial unmet need to improve our understanding of this so-called genomic dark matter in order to develop novel classes of drugs to improve treatment of disease. Comprehensive experimental investigation of these proteins in the context of hundreds of thousands of compounds and thousands of diseases would be prohibitively expensive, but computational approaches could significantly refine the list. In this project we will apply two sophisticated computational approaches to the task of predicting the most promising novel drug targets. We will integrate the knowledge bases DrugCentral and other resources with the disease and phenotype knowledge base of the Monarch Initiative into a semantically harmonized knowledge graph (KG). This will result in a KG with comprehensive coverage of diseases, genes, gene functions, phenotypic abnormalities, drugs, drug mechanisms, and drug targets. Machine learning (ML) identifies patterns from training sets and applies the patterns to predict entities and relations in new data. ML using KGs has become a hot new research area in computer science, but remains difficult to use for real-world applications, owing to the lack of adequate software packages. We will therefore implement state-of-the art learning algorithms based on deep learning on KGs by extending and adapting selected algorithms to the task of drug and drug target discovery. We will develop an easy-to-use software library and demonstrate its use by means of notebooks that will be designed to serve as starting points for future computational research by other scientists, since they will contain the analysis workflow along with documentation about each step. The human genome codes more than 500 protein kinases, which are enzymes that add a phosphate group to specific amino acid residues and thereby transmit a biological signal. There are currently 35 FDA approved protein kinase modulators acting on 38 protein kinases, which are thus one of the most important groups of druggable proteins encoded by our genome. We will perform a detailed computational study of this group and experimentally validate our top, novel candidate using a patient-derived xenograft model system. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The human genome codes for over 20,000 proteins, roughly 3,000 of which are thought to be “druggable”, meaning that in principle they could be targeted by medications to treat disease. However, only about 600 of these proteins are currently targeted by an approved medication, and our knowledge about most of the remaining proteins is limited. Our goal is to develop bioinformatic software that will combine information about these proteins, diseases, clinical manifestations, medications, and other relevant data into a network of information (i.e., a graph), and to use sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict novel drugs and drug targets. We will focus our computational strategy on the class of protein kinase inhibitors, which are a leading target for cancer drugs. The human genome encodes an estimated 555 kinases, 37 of which have been successfully targeted by anti-cancer medications. By using machine learning to predict which of the remaining 500+ protein kinases are most likely to be amenable to medical treatment, there is a potential to accelerate the pace of research into novel treatments. We will perform a pilot study of the top predicted candidates using a mouse model of cancer.",Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs,9742135,U01CA239108,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aloral', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enzymes', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Molecular Biology', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computer science', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge integration', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'open source', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'protein kinase modulator', 'real world application', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NCI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U01,2019,588030,0.05961439856718282
"Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins Project Summary Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biological entities to form biological pathways inside and between cells. Targeted therapies are designed to mitigate or reverse malfunctions caused by mutations in proteins via providing drugs to recover normal biological pathways’ activities. Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways is a powerful way to infer potential functions of these proteins. Pathway-based approaches are now routinely applied in bioinformatics and computational biology data analysis and visualization. Pathway databases are essential for those approaches. During the past two decades, our team has been working together on building the Reactome knowledgebase, arguably the most popular and comprehensive open source biological pathway database, covering over half of human protein-coding genes and widely used in the research community. In this application, we propose to develop a Reactome IDG pathway portal, which will allow localization of understudied proteins in biological pathways, identifying likely interactions with better-known proteins in specific processes annotated in Reactome, pinpointing most effective drug targets via pathway modeling, thus generating testable predictions of molecular functions of these proteins in key domains of biology. Specially we will develop a web-based application to place understudied proteins in the context of Reactome pathways by importing a variety of data types collected in the IDG projects and other resources and then overlaying them onto the Reactome pathways by leveraging existing Reactome software tools (e.g. interaction overlay). Furthermore, we will develop a machine learning approach to predict functional interactions between understudied proteins and well-known Reactome annotated proteins and a Boolean network-based fuzzy logic modeling approach to integrate the scores produced from the machine learning approach to simulate the impacts of understudied proteins on pathways’ activities. We believe our approach will provide a unique and powerful approach to help the community to understand the contribution of the understudied proteins to cellular functions. Project Narrative Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways provides a framework to understand potential functions of these proteins. Reactome is the most comprehensive open source biological pathway knowledgebase. We propose to develop a Reactome IDG portal for understudied proteins, assisting researchers to infer biological functions of understudied proteins.",Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins,9740448,U01CA239069,"['Animal Model', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Genes', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Infectious Agent', 'Level of Evidence', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Technology', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Validation', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'data visualization', 'knowledge base', 'open source', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'web app']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,458758,0.1191457354675179
"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9712954,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine vision', 'member', 'neural network', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,459955,0.02634469254629926
"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The cellular network and its environment govern cell and organism behavior and are fundamental to the comprehension of function, misfunction and drug discovery. Over the last few years, drugs were observed to often bind to more than one target; thus, poly-pharmacology approaches can be advantageous, complementing the ""one drug - one target"" strategy. Targeting drug discovery from the systems biology standpoint can help in studies of network effects of mono- and poly-pharmacology. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the usefulness of network description and tools for mono- and poly-pharmacology, and the ways through which protein interactions can help single- and multi-target drug discovery efforts. We further describe how, when combined with experimental data, modeled structural networks which can predict which proteins interact and provide the structures of their interfaces, can model the cellular pathways, and suggest which specific pathways are likely to be affected. Such structural networks may facilitate structure-based drug design; forecast side effects of drugs; and suggest how the effects of drug binding can propagate in multi-molecular complexes and pathways. Cellular functions are performed through protein-protein interactions; therefore, identification of these interactions is crucial for understanding biological processes. Recent studies suggest that knowledge-based approaches are more useful than ""blind"" docking for modeling at large scales. However, a caveat of knowledge-based approaches is that they treat molecules as rigid structures. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) offers a wealth of conformations. Here, we exploited an ensemble of the conformations in predictions by a knowledge-based method, PRISM. We tested ""difficult"" cases in a docking-benchmark data set, where the unbound and bound protein forms are structurally different. Considering alternative conformations for each protein, the percentage of successfully predicted interactions increased from about 26 to 66%, and 57% of the interactions were successfully predicted in an ""unbiased"" scenario, in which data related to the bound forms were not utilized. If the appropriate conformation, or relevant template interface, is unavailable in the PDB, PRISM could not predict the interaction successfully. The pace of the growth of the PDB promises a rapid increase of ensemble conformations emphasizing the merit of such knowledge-based ensemble strategies for higher success rates in protein-protein interaction predictions on an interactome scale. We constructed the structural network of ERK interacting proteins as a case study. We constructed and simulated a ""minimal proteome"" model using Langevin dynamics. It contains 206 essential protein types that were compiled from the literature. For comparison, we generated six proteomes with randomized concentrations. We found that the net charges and molecular weights of the proteins in the minimal genome are not random. The net charge of a protein decreases linearly with molecular weight, with small proteins being mostly positively charged and large proteins negatively charged. The protein copy numbers in the minimal genome have the tendency to maximize the number of protein-protein interactions in the network. Negatively charged proteins that tend to have larger sizes can provide a large collision cross-section allowing them to interact with other proteins; on the other hand, the smaller positively charged proteins could have higher diffusion speed and are more likely to collide with other proteins. Proteomes with random charge/mass populations form less stable clusters than those with experimental protein copy numbers. Our study suggests that ""proper"" populations of negatively and positively charged proteins are important for maintaining a protein-protein interaction network in a proteome. It is interesting to note that the minimal genome model based on the charge and mass of Escherichia coli may have alarger protein-protein interaction network than that based on the lower organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Proteins function through their interactions, and the availability of protein interaction networks could help in understanding cellular processes. However, the known structural data are limited and the classical network node-and-edge representation, where proteins are nodes and interactions are edges, shows only which proteins interact; not how they interact. Structural networks provide this information. Protein-protein interface structures can also indicate which binding partners can interact simultaneously and which are competitive, and can help forecasting potentially harmful drug side effects. Here, we use a powerful protein-protein interactions prediction tool which is able to carry out accurate predictions on the proteome scale to construct the structural network of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This knowledge-based method, PRISM, is motif-based, and is combined with flexible refinement and energy scoring. PRISM predicts protein interactions based on structural and evolutionary similarity to known protein interfaces. We focus on improvement of PRISM toward modeling of specific interaction of key proteins in cancer and inflammation pathways to figure out regulation in central processes in the cell. We have already developed the prototype method and applied it to Helicobacter pylori and most recently, viral oncoproteins. n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,10014371,ZIABC010442,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Inflammation', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Lower Organism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Modeling', 'Modeling of Cellular Pathways', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Movement', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Oncoproteins', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'base', 'biological research', 'blind', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'globular protein', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'microbiota', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'molecular dynamics', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2019,171764,0.13943348067753536
"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers.

"Systems-level functional proteomics analysis assemblies in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models of tauopathy The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively map and identify the subnetworks of synaptic protein complexes that are central players in the synaptic dysfunction occurring with neurodegeneration. We will use the emerging power of quantitative network proteomics in the Emili laboratory to systematically characterize the major protein assemblies present at normal and diseased synapses on a proteome scale. This research will be propelled by discoveries from the Wolozin laboratory demonstrating that a dynamic network of protein interactions drives tau biology and changes with the course of disease. Interpreting these perturbed assembly networks, though, demands knowledge of the localization and compositional specificity of such complexes. The unbiased interactome screening technology developed by the Emili laboratory is uniquely suited for unbiased interrogations of synaptic protein networks. We hypothesize that selective disruption of specific synaptic protein assemblies mediates the functional degeneration associated with tauopathy. Aim 1 will determine how synaptic protein complexes differ between general cortical and cholinergic neurons. We will isolate and biochemical separate synaptic assemblies from total cortical and cholinergic (ChAT::GFP) synapses, using FACS to further purify ChAT:GFP synapses. Separated assemblies will be characterized by precision mass spectrometry and integrative data mining (machine learning) procedures to determine their composition and post- translational modification states, and to map dynamically changing interactions implicated in altered synaptic function during normal aging. Aim 2 will determine how the macromolecular structures of synaptic protein assemblies change with aging and AD. We will analyze cortical synaptosomal complexes from P301S tau and P301S tau x TIA1+/- mice, the latter which exhibited delayed degeneration. Key drivers in synaptic dysfunction will be identified and verified in AD and control human samples by co-immunoprecipitation. Aim 3 will identify complexes that are critical drivers of synaptic function by disrupting prioritized assemblies using genetic and opticogenetic tools. This work will determine key regulators of synaptic function in health and disease, and will also produce expanded genetic tools and outstanding targets for future approaches using bio-engineered regulation.

"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å Cα-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations. Project Narrative We are combining experimental and computational approaches to produce a predictive understanding of protein folding and dynamics. Our focus has expanded to more complicated systems, including an anti-freeze protein and the plug domain of the TonB-dependent transporters involved in pathogenic bacterial iron sequestration.

"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced.

"Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences PROJECT SUMMARY This study investigates the specificity of farnesyl transferase (FTase) that isoprenylates CaaX proteins. Studies probing the in vivo activity of the FTase have historically used reporters (e.g. Ras GTPases) that undergo complex multi-step post-translational modification (PTM), involving initial farnesylation followed by CaaX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. This study takes advantage of Hsp40 Ydj1, a farnesylation-only reporter for which we have developed a range of methods to monitor its PTM status. Its use reveals that farnesylation is not necessarily coupled to subsequent PTMs as has been generally accepted for CaaX proteins, and that FTase specificity is significantly more promiscuous than anticipated. These findings challenge the conventional paradigm for how farnesylated proteins are modified and which proteins are targeted by FTase. We will extend our studies to fully resolve the specificity of FTase using a combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical studies. We bring to bear on our investigations an exceptionally strong set of preliminary findings, the complementary expertise of several research groups, and a comprehensive molecular toolbox for the study of farnesylated proteins and other enzymes associated with this post-translational modification pathway. PROJECT NARRATIVE Farnesylated proteins are intimately involved in disease. This project investigates the target specificity of the farnesyl transferase that mediates protein farnesylation.

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

The KMC long-term objective is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins.",Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome,9620018,U24CA224370,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alleles', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'FAIR principles', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome Components', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources Management', 'International', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Non-Human Protein', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'TRD@ gene cluster', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'computer science', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'gender difference', 'health data', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel', 'online community', 'outreach', 'programs', 'repository', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U24,2019,1000000,0.050739765747145026
"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month.

"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month. The final aim describes how we will enable this community to make best use of UniProt, through user training, outreach and improved user interfaces, driven by user testing.

"Proteomics of ciliopathy protein complexes Summary Ciliopathies are a diverse class of developmental diseases that can manifest as defects in kidney, skeletal, eye, heart, reproductive, or mental function. Many ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl, Joubert, and Meckel Gruber Syndromes, are caused by defects in the major protein complexes that characterize the ciliary compartment. At least 1,000 proteins are associated with cilia biogenesis and function; uncovering the principles of ciliary protein organization thus requires a large scale, systematic investigation. Our current human protein complex maps, while extensive, have only moderate coverage of ciliary proteins, warranting the collection of targeted experimental datasets. I will use comparative proteomic analysis of cilia from multiple organisms to determine deeply conserved protein-protein interactions likely to be critical to ciliary function in humans. Examining human biological systems in the context of their level of conservation across species is a productive route to distinguish biological signal from noise. My preliminary data on three ciliated species confirm that this approach is capable of identifying conserved ciliary protein complexes. If a pair of proteins are found in physical contact in diverse species, having survived speciation events and gene loss, it can be predicted that this physical interaction is important. First, using mass spectrometry, we will experimentally detect protein complexes within the cilia across a spectrum of eukaryotic organisms, broadly defining conserved ciliary proteins. Second, we will integrate our own experimental data, some of which we have already collected, with outside data to construct a system-wide map of conserved ciliary protein complexes. These conserved ciliary protein complexes are strongly predicted to be functionally important in humans, and potentially involved in human birth defects. Finally, we will test a targeted subset of proteins predicted to associate with known birth defect proteins in vivo using Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system. We have four candidate genes in hand, and will consider candidates from the prior aims as appropriate. This project will lead to a map of critical conserved ciliary protein complexes, a future primary resource for research into diverse ciliopathies. Project Narrative! Ciliopathies are a class of birth defects caused by defective cilia. This project will determine conserved ciliary protein complexes in a series of targeted proteomics experiments, systematically mapping ciliary protein organization as a guide for research into ciliopathies and cilia function.",Proteomics of ciliopathy protein complexes,9588803,F31GM123683,"['Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cilia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Comparative Biology', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Core Protein', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Investigation', 'Joubert syndrome', 'Kidney', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Meckel-Gruber syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Whole Organism', 'Xenopus', 'Xenopus laevis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'ciliopathy', 'cilium biogenesis', 'comparative', 'developmental disease', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'in vivo', 'link protein', 'mental function', 'novel', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'reproductive function', 'skeletal']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F31,2019,35616,0.10800693247975372
"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules. In this project, we aim to develop rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical frameworks for such tasks and apply them to study proteins, RNAs and chromosomes.",Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes,9731563,R01GM126558,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Grain', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'database structure', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genome annotation', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'protein distribution', 'protein structure', 'shape analysis', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool development']",NIGMS,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,308756,0.10664986370136406
"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9618886,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,317007,0.11023408797719611
"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The same protein sequence can be encoded by more than one nucleic acid sequence. Historically, “synonymous” changes in a nucleic acid sequence were thought to be “silent”, but it is now emerging that some synonymous changes can change the folding of the encoded protein, and/or its transport into a membrane. We will integrate novel computational analyses and laboratory experiments to uncover the connections between synonymous substitutions and protein production in the cell.",Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis,9690777,R01GM120733,"['Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homologous Protein', 'Informatics', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Side', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gene product', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'three dimensional structure', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2019,278100,0.11884763110987107
"Centrosome Duplication and Maturation As a non-membrane bound organelle, the assembly of centrosomes must be driven by PPIs. These interactions are likely modified by highly regulated changes in protein binding affinity in a cell-type and cell-cycle dependent manner, which can in turn modulate centrosome behavior and function. We have focused on identifying PPIs among a core set of conserved centrosome proteins, classified as proteins of the centriole, the PCM and regulatory kinases. Previous high-throughput and small-scale interactions studies have suggested that there might be a limited number of PPIs among centrosome proteins and have raised the possibility that few interactions are used to construct a simple, ultimately static structure. Our data does not support this simplistic view of the centrosome. We have uncovered a large number of direct PPIs, dramatically expanding our understanding of the centrosome interaction landscape. This highly interconnected landscape suggests a much more complex centrosome assembly and regulatory process, which we suggest can be leveraged to perform a variety of specialized tasks dictated by a broad spectrum of cellular requirements.   In previous years we have focused our attention on Pericentrin-Like-Protein (PLP), Asterless (Asl), Cep135, and the critical centriole duplication kinase Plk4. In the past year, we have added the protein Ana2 and Cnn in collaboration with the labs of David Agard and Gregory Rogers. These studies have uncovered important regulatory mechanisms related to centriole duplication and PCM assembly. However, our main focus for the past year has been to determine how a proximal end of the centriole is established, and for what purpose.   Interestingly, the pericentriolar material (PCM), which organizes microtubules is frequently positioned at the proximal end of the centriole. How PCM is specifically localized to the proximal end, and if this localization has functional significance, remains largely unexplored. We have used the centrioles of spermatocytes in the Drosophila male germline, which grow to almost 2 microns, to interrogate how the Drosophila Pericentrin ortholog (PLP) is localized to the proximal end of the centriole, and test if this localization is critical for function. We find that the localization of PLP to the proximal end is achieved by limiting the availability of PLP protein to the earliest phases of centriole growth, before centriole elongation. Furthermore, plp transcript is also rapidly lost prior to centriole elongation. Exogenous expression of PLP under the control of promoters that specifically express during the elongation period, result in the deposition of PLP along the entire length of the centriole; promoters that express prior to elongation behave as wild type. Interestingly, during meiosis, centrioles with PLP inappropriately along their entire length also have PCM recruited along entire length, indicating that PLP is sufficient to instruct PCM localization. To determine if the positioning of PLP and PCM at the proximal end has a functional consequence, we followed centrioles as spermatocytes developed into spermatids. Through live cell imaging in developing testes, and careful staging of fixed tissue, we find that centrioles with PLP and PCM along the entire length are positioned such that the centriole is laterally associated with the nucleus as opposed to the normal proximal-end docking to the nucleus. This, to our knowledge, is the first demonstration that the proximal localizing of PCM serves a purpose  to ensure proper centriole-nucleus attachment in spermatids. Furthermore, our preliminary studies indicate that this improper centriole docking results in a major reduction in properly formed sperm. We are now testing the impact of mispositioning PCM on overall animal fertility.  By combining our interactome with in vivo experimental evidence in Drosophila, we demonstrate how large interaction information can lead to in depth mechanistic insight into macromolecular assemblies. Integrating protein localization, dynamics and functional data with direct PPI information and mutant analysis, we show that interactions can predict inter- and intra-molecular architecture, identify kinase substrates and uncover regulated interactions within the centrosome. Understanding the interaction landscape of the centrosome is a critical foundation needed to gain an understanding of the molecular basis for human diseases caused by dysfunction of centriole, centrosome and cilia proteins.  The diversity of centrosome-related diseases, such as microcephally, dwarfism, polycystic kidney disease and many others, can be best explained by loss of specific PPIs, rather than a simple complete loss of protein function stemming from a null mutation. We believe that our study will also guide new avenues of centrosome research that focus on the in-depth understanding of the diverse functions of these proteins, and could serve as a framework to explore other complex cellular processes. n/a",Centrosome Duplication and Maturation,10008801,ZIAHL006104,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemistry', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Centrioles', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosomes', 'Cilia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drosophila genus', 'Dwarfism', 'Ensure', 'Fertility', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Interphase', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Meiosis', 'Microcephaly', 'Microscopy', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Organelles', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Spermatids', 'Spermatocytes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Testis', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'cell type', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'live cell imaging', 'macromolecular assembly', 'male', 'mutant', 'null mutation', 'pericentrin', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'recruit', 'sperm cell', 'stem']",NHLBI,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",ZIA,2019,873004,0.0890503667744767
"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This proposal aims to significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or IDP ensemble of structures, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,9633923,U01GM121667,"['Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Phase', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Theory', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Solvents', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'aqueous', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cost', 'database structure', 'drug structure', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic field', 'personalized approach', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2019,294912,0.07891118556798776
"Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs Project Summary Eukaryotic cells have diverse cellular components, including subcellular organelles and sub-organelle compartments. The accurate targeting of proteins to these cellular components is crucial in establishing and maintaining cellular organizations and functions. Mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. However, the vast majority of proteins lack subcellular/sub-organelle localization annotation. Compared with experimental methods, computational prediction of protein localization provides an efficient and effective way for proteome annotation and experimental design. The current prediction tools for protein localization have significant room for improvement. In addition, no tool can predict localization at the sub- organelle resolution or internal localization signals. Deep learning, as the cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new opportunity for this classical bioinformatics problem. The availability of recent high- throughput localization data can also train deep learning well. The PI’s lab has demonstrated some success on a special case, i.e., predicting mitochondrial localizations for plants using deep learning.  In this project, the PI proposes to develop new methods and a standalone toolkit for accurate and scalable protein localization prediction at the subcellular and sub-organelle levels, as well as for characterization of localization motifs (including novel internal motifs). The general approach is to design a semi-supervised deep- learning method that utilizes both annotated protein sequences with known localization and unannotated protein sequences as training data. Through the realization of an unsupervised deep-learning approach, a general representation of protein sequences will be implemented, characterizing both local and global features of protein sequences. By visualizing and characterizing the deep-learning models, novel, interpretable protein sequence patterns will be predicted as putative targeting peptides and compared with known localization signals. We will also use the methods to be developed and the unsupervised models to be trained on all protein sequences as a general framework for other sequence-based prediction problems that predict the label of a protein and the key residues contributing to the label. We will make the platform highly customizable and apply it to three applications, including ubiquitination protein prediction, enzyme EC number prediction, and protein family/subfamily classification. The innovative contributions to protein sequence-based analyses and predictions include: (1) using raw amino acid sequences as training inputs without feature engineering; (2) utilizing the huge amount of unannotated data in an unsupervised deep learning to characterize a general protein feature representation; (3) identifying potential targeting signals (especially internal motifs) by decoding the trained deep- learning models, augmented with sophisticated attention mechanisms; 4) detecting multiple-organelle targeting and sub-organelle localizations by a novel hierarchical multi-label architecture; and (5) combining features from different data sources by a multiplicative fused CNN model. Relevance to Public Health  A protein typically has a well-defined localization in a cell to perform its function, and mis-localization of proteins is often associated with metabolic disorders and diseases. Protein localization prediction can provide valuable information for understanding disease mechanisms and designing treatment. To address the limitations of current computational methods, this project will apply cutting-edge deep-learning methods to deliver new computational methods and tools with improved accuracy and detailed sub-organelle prediction for protein localization.",Deep learning for protein subcellular/sub-organelle localizations and localization motifs,9600437,R21LM012790,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Experimental Designs', 'Generations', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'N-terminal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nobel Prize', 'Organelles', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Plants', 'Protein Family', 'Protein translocation', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'recurrent neural network', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2018,174375,0.13053470699732583
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship and to predict protein structures and interactions. The results will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as better understanding of disease processes, development of novel diagnostics and drugs, and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.",New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction,9545787,R01GM089753,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Family', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Homologous Gene', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Occupations', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'Work', 'atomic interactions', 'base', 'biological research', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'monomer', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIGMS,TOYOTA TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE / CHICAGO,R01,2018,306425,0.16464235584081557
"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9520213,R01GM124559,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'forest', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,384167,0.11457715609186898
"Probing Hidden Conformational Space and Dynamical States of Circadian Clock Proteins through Rigid Residue Scan and Machine Learning Protein dynamical distribution as ensemble in their phase space is directly linked to allostery. Some triggering events, such as binding process or chemical modification, could cause significant change of protein conformation as well as dynamics distribution. These led to two complementary allosteric models: conformation-driven and dynamics-driven allostery. Mutations of certain amino acid residues could alter distribution of protein conformation or dynamics, and regulate its allosteric function. This suggests that overall space for conformational and dynamical distribution potentially accessible for certain protein is much larger than those of specific structure, such as wild type. Certain perturbation including mutation could cause protein to dwell in additional (referred as hidden) conformational space or dynamical states. Therefore, directing proteins into these hidden states could serve as a novel approach in protein engineering. We propose to apply rigid residue scan method recently developed in our lab and machine learning models for data mining to systematically explore hidden conformational space and dynamical states of proteins with quantitative evaluations based on individual residue assessment. Our long-term goal is to exploit hidden conformational spaces and dynamical states of proteins and develop precise regulations of protein allostery and function. Two parallel and complementary specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis that many proteins have hidden conformational space and dynamical states inaccessible to the wild type but could be accessed through certain perturbation, and that additional space and states lead to precise allostery regulation or even new protein functions. In Aim 1, we propose to identify residues guiding conformational driven allostery to reach certain hidden conformational space for conformation driven allosteric circadian clock proteins. We will apply rigid residue scan method to efficiently sample hidden conformational space, and develop dimension deduction and Markov state model to theoretically describe protein conformational space. We will also apply machine learning and feature selection methods to develop classification model to quantitatively measure the conformation driven allostery. In Aim 2, we propose to identify residues of dynamics driven allosteric protein as keys to reach hidden dynamical states for dynamics driven allosteric circadian clock proteins. Similarly, we will apply rigid residue scan method to efficiently sample hidden dynamical space, and apply machine learning and feature selection methods to quantitatively measure the dynamics driven allostery. Mutants will be designed for the identified key residues in both aims. These mutants will be subjected to further molecular simulation for validation purpose. Only those computationally validated mutants will be subject to experimental test. We expect that the proposed research will lead to a novel theoretical model of protein allostery and provide computational tools to quantitatively predict the impacts on protein allostery from specific residue, which could benefit experimental study of the circadian clock proteins to design mutants as novel optogenetic tools. Narratives Protein allostery regulates protein functional activities by perturbation at a distant site. Allosteric modulation has become a novel approach to develop optogenetic tools to control biological processes. Here we propose to exploit hidden conformational spaces and dynamical states of proteins and develop precise regulations of protein allostery and function. Our efforts will lead to a novel theoretical model of protein allostery and provide computational tools to quantitatively predict the impacts on protein allostery from specific residue. This could greatly benefit experimental study of the circadian clock proteins to design mutants with new allosteric states as optogenetic tools.  ",Probing Hidden Conformational Space and Dynamical States of Circadian Clock Proteins through Rigid Residue Scan and Machine Learning,9516538,R15GM122013,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Biological Process', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clock protein', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deductibles', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'circadian pacemaker', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'protein distribution', 'protein function', 'simulation', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,355094,0.11290005900919073
"Integrated Prediction and Validation of Protein Structures ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of three-dimensional protein structure is indispensable in biomedical research. Protein structure and function are intimately linked, and thus structure facilitates drug discovery, aids investigations of protein-protein interactions, informs mutagenesis analysis, guides protein engineering and the design of new proteins, and provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of disease. However, the number of protein sequences available in the genomic era far exceeds the capacity of the main experimental structure determination techniques of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, resulting in a substantial sequence- structure gap. We address this ever-widening gap by developing and disseminating novel protein structure modeling tools. This renewal project is a new collaboration between experts in computational modeling (Cheng) and experimental structural biology (Tanner). We plan to develop innovative, integrated machine learning (e.g., deep learning), data mining and statistical modeling methods to address major challenges in both template-based structure modeling and template-free (ab initio) structure modeling. We will apply these tools to enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, a group of enzymes that are involved in numerous important biological processes and implicated in many diseases due to mutations. The ALDH models will be experimentally validated using X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays. Furthermore, we will combine the modeling power of our structural Input-Output hidden Markov model with experimental small- angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to predict the tertiary structures of large multi-domain proteins. The integration of computational and experimental sciences in this project positions us uniquely in structure modeling space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research.

"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The cellular network and its environment govern cell and organism behavior and are fundamental to the comprehension of function, misfunction and drug discovery. Over the last few years, drugs were observed to often bind to more than one target; thus, poly-pharmacology approaches can be advantageous, complementing the ""one drug - one target"" strategy. Targeting drug discovery from the systems biology standpoint can help in studies of network effects of mono- and poly-pharmacology. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the usefulness of network description and tools for mono- and poly-pharmacology, and the ways through which protein interactions can help single- and multi-target drug discovery efforts. We further describe how, when combined with experimental data, modeled structural networks which can predict which proteins interact and provide the structures of their interfaces, can model the cellular pathways, and suggest which specific pathways are likely to be affected. Such structural networks may facilitate structure-based drug design; forecast side effects of drugs; and suggest how the effects of drug binding can propagate in multi-molecular complexes and pathways. Cellular functions are performed through protein-protein interactions; therefore, identification of these interactions is crucial for understanding biological processes. Recent studies suggest that knowledge-based approaches are more useful than ""blind"" docking for modeling at large scales. However, a caveat of knowledge-based approaches is that they treat molecules as rigid structures. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) offers a wealth of conformations. Here, we exploited an ensemble of the conformations in predictions by a knowledge-based method, PRISM. We tested ""difficult"" cases in a docking-benchmark data set, where the unbound and bound protein forms are structurally different. Considering alternative conformations for each protein, the percentage of successfully predicted interactions increased from about 26 to 66%, and 57% of the interactions were successfully predicted in an ""unbiased"" scenario, in which data related to the bound forms were not utilized. If the appropriate conformation, or relevant template interface, is unavailable in the PDB, PRISM could not predict the interaction successfully. The pace of the growth of the PDB promises a rapid increase of ensemble conformations emphasizing the merit of such knowledge-based ensemble strategies for higher success rates in protein-protein interaction predictions on an interactome scale. We constructed the structural network of ERK interacting proteins as a case study. We constructed and simulated a ""minimal proteome"" model using Langevin dynamics. It contains 206 essential protein types that were compiled from the literature. For comparison, we generated six proteomes with randomized concentrations. We found that the net charges and molecular weights of the proteins in the minimal genome are not random. The net charge of a protein decreases linearly with molecular weight, with small proteins being mostly positively charged and large proteins negatively charged. The protein copy numbers in the minimal genome have the tendency to maximize the number of protein-protein interactions in the network. Negatively charged proteins that tend to have larger sizes can provide a large collision cross-section allowing them to interact with other proteins; on the other hand, the smaller positively charged proteins could have higher diffusion speed and are more likely to collide with other proteins. Proteomes with random charge/mass populations form less stable clusters than those with experimental protein copy numbers. Our study suggests that ""proper"" populations of negatively and positively charged proteins are important for maintaining a protein-protein interaction network in a proteome. It is interesting to note that the minimal genome model based on the charge and mass of Escherichia coli may have alarger protein-protein interaction network than that based on the lower organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Proteins function through their interactions, and the availability of protein interaction networks could help in understanding cellular processes. However, the known structural data are limited and the classical network node-and-edge representation, where proteins are nodes and interactions are edges, shows only which proteins interact; not how they interact. Structural networks provide this information. Protein-protein interface structures can also indicate which binding partners can interact simultaneously and which are competitive, and can help forecasting potentially harmful drug side effects. Here, we use a powerful protein-protein interactions prediction tool which is able to carry out accurate predictions on the proteome scale to construct the structural network of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This knowledge-based method, PRISM, is motif-based, and is combined with flexible refinement and energy scoring. PRISM predicts protein interactions based on structural and evolutionary similarity to known protein interfaces. We focus on improvement of PRISM toward modeling of specific interaction of key proteins in cancer and inflammation pathways to figure out regulation in central processes in the cell.

While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Understanding molecular rules governing protein allostery by deep mutational scanning Project Summary/Abstract Allostery is action at a distance in proteins. It is a property by which perturbation at one site of a protein causes an effect at a distant site of the protein. As nature's biological switches allosteric proteins regulate virtually every major process including catalysis, transcription, transport and signaling. Kinases, G-protein coupled receptors and nuclear receptors are therapeutically important allosteric proteins that play a major role in human health. Disruption of allosteric communication caused by mutations in these proteins is strongly associated with many types of disease abnormalities including cancer. Since the discovery of allostery in the 1960s, the molecular mechanism by which perturbation at one end of a protein is allosterically transmitted to the other end remains a mystery. Understanding molecular “rules” governing allostery is a fundamental problem in protein biochemistry and biophysics. Such rules may provide a deep insight into how proteins work through interactions between residues. Current approaches to studying allostery, which are biophysical, structural or computational, have two limitations. First, they provide an incomplete picture. Allostery involves the interplay of protein dynamics, structural changes and their effects on function. Probing each independently, as most studies do, does not give a complete understanding. Structure alone cannot explain dynamics, dynamical movement does not imply functional role, and functional studies may not provide insight into the underlying molecular causes. Second, detailed mechanistic studies of individual allosteric proteins while invaluable, are tedious, and cannot be scaled up to investigate many types of allosteric proteins. As a result, unifying heuristic rules would be difficult to infer from such individual case studies. The goal of my research is to develop a generalized, scalable method integrating structure, function and dynamics to understand, quantify and predict molecular drivers of protein allostery. With allosteric transcription factors as a model system, we will determine residues important for allostery (`hotspots') and their connectivity (`pathway') by deep mutational scanning, a method for large-scale functional characterization. We establish a critical link between structure and function by computationally modeling each mutation with Rosetta. We use machine learning on this rich sequence-structure-function dataset to recognize common molecular features (van der Waals, electrostatics, hydrogen bonds etc.) of allosteric hotspot residues, to build a predictive molecular model of allostery. Thus, we integrate high-throughput functional studies, structure-based modeling and machine learning to understand molecular rules governing allostery. Any allosteric protein whose activity can be coupled to a high-throughput screen, of which there are many, is amenable to our approach. Over time as the number and diversity of allosteric protein datasets increases, we expect that the accuracy and generalizability of predictions will continuously improve. Our long-term objective is to be able to (a) predict functional impact of thousands of mutations in disease-associated allosteric proteins revealed by genome sequencing (b) discover novel allosteric sites that improve selectivity and efficacy of drugs. Project Narrative GPCRs, nuclear receptors, ion channels and kinases are allosteric proteins that alone account for 44% of all human protein drug targets. We propose to develop a broad experimental and computational platform to understand molecular mechanism of allostery. This study will pave the way to explaining how dysfunction in allosteric proteins manifests into disease, and developing `smart' (allosteric) drugs that restore normal function.",Understanding molecular rules governing protein allostery by deep mutational scanning,9562195,DP2GM132682,"['Allosteric Site', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'Case Study', 'Catalysis', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Functional disorder', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'drug efficacy', 'genome sequencing', 'heuristics', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular modeling', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'scale up', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,DP2,2018,2146877,0.1320668334554132
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9564155,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2018,335245,0.04701425004837323
"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9421497,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'member', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,444578,0.02634469254629926
"Quantitative Biotherapeutic Particle Characterization via Deep Neural Networks Project Summary  Despite their many beneﬁts and common use, protein-based drugs can elicit serious adverse side-effects. Many of these side-effects are believed to be caused by small protein aggregates. One tool for measuring these particles in a high-throughput fashion is Microﬂow-Imaging (MFI). MFI is commonly used in both academia and industry to characterize subvisible particles (those   25 m in size) in protein therapeutics. In many formulations protein aggregates that are   10 m in size account for upwards of 90% of the protein aggregates in the product. Subvisible protein aggregates have been demonstrated to correlate with adverse drug responses; however, which speciﬁc protein aggregates induce immunogenic responses remains unknown.  Pharmaceutical companies are required to record and catalog vast volumes of FIM data on protein therapeutic products, but are only mandated under FDA regulations (i.e., USP 788 ) to control the number of particles exceeding 10 and 25 m in delivered products. Hence a vast amount of digital images are available to analyze. Recent studies have indicated that some of the factors correlated with adverse drug responses are encoded in MFI image data.  Current state-of-the-art MFI analysis methods rely on a relatively low-dimensional list of “morphological fea- tures” to characterize particles, but these methods ignore an enormous amount of information encoded in the ex- isting large digital image repositories. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs or “ConvNets”) have demon- strated the ability to extract predictive information from raw macroscopic image data without requiring the selection or speciﬁcation of “morphological features” in a variety of tasks. However, the heterogeneity, polydispersity of pro- tein therapeutics, and optical phenomena associated with subvisible MFI particle measurements introduce new challenges regarding the application of CNNs to MFI image analysis.  This proposal will spring from state-of-the-art deep CNN methods to provide new analysis tools capable of reliably analyzing and classifying heterogeneous MFI protein therapeutics data. The envisioned software product, capable of processing images from both of the leading manufacturers of MFI instruments (Fluid Imaging Inc. and ProteinSimple), will provide high-throughput, data-driven models that efﬁciently capture information encoded in the large collection of image data, avoiding the need to deﬁne “features” a priori and is anticipated to provide a paradigm shift to the MFI quantiﬁcation ﬁeld. We anticipate that the proposed algorithms and software will help in correlating which protein aggregates induce adverse side-effects and will also serve as a useful process monitoring tool. Project Narrative  Protein aggregates, found to some level in all commercial protein therapeutic based drugs, can be asso- ciated with a number of adverse responses in patients. In this project, new machine learning algorithms will be developed for analyzing large collections of biotherapeutics (protein therapeutic based drugs) measured via microﬂow-imaging (MFI) microscopy. Phase I will develop prototype software capable analyzing images of protein aggregrates in biotherapeutics measured via MFI for both process monitoring and identifying which characteris- tics of protein aggregates are correlated to high risk for causing adverse responses in patients.",Quantitative Biotherapeutic Particle Characterization via Deep Neural Networks,9619673,R41GM130513,"['Academia', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse reactions', 'Agitation', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Architecture', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Formulation', 'Freezing', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Pump', 'Pythons', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic community technique', 'Vendor', 'base', 'commercialization', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging software', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'protein aggregate', 'prototype', 'repository', 'response', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R41,2018,222381,0.07370404007337011

"Structure-based prediction of the interactome Supplement Summary “Structure-based prediction of the interactome” NIH R01GM081871-10 PI: Bonnie Berger We have designed and implemented a system for privacy-preserving and scalable sharing of drug-target interaction data (Aim 1, under review at Science), where we required GPUs to run our protocol, discover and experimentally validate novel drug-target interactions and will make our software publicly-available for academic and non-profit use (Aim 3). At the same time, we have presented a novel loss function for training classifiers from positive and unlabeled data and developed a software pipeline, Topaz, which uses convolutional neural networks trained with few positive examples for protein detection (Aim 2, RECOMB 2018). We are now developing new deep learning models for protein structure embedding and extending the Topaz framework to learn a general deep learning model of protein images from multiple cryo-EM micrograph datasets. Our continued progress on these projects is significantly jeopardized by our lack of GPU compute power. While in the last year we have purchased a compute node with four GPUs, we are continually frustrated by wait-times and inability to try different models and hyperparameters. Thus, we are requesting an additional node with eight GPUs to enable us to reach the broader goals of our grant.

"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å C-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations.

"Computational Design of Crystal Lattice Interactions to Determine Recalcitrant Protein Structures PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are macromolecules that carry out innumerable biological functions ranging from intracellular signaling to immune response. The specific function of a protein is determined by its three-dimensional structure. Therefore, an essential step towards understanding protein function is elucidating protein structure. However, the premier method for structure determination, X-ray crystallography, can be limited by many potential factors including the quality of the protein crystal. The proposed research will investigate the effects of protein– protein interactions in the crystal lattice on crystal quality and resolution and develop a design approach to stabilize lattice interactions, which should result in higher-quality crystals.  First, the molecular determinants of high-quality protein crystal structures will be identified by (1) curating a set of representative structures from the Protein Data Bank, (2) extracting relevant features, such as interaction energy, buried solvent accessible surface area, interfacial packing quality, and residue usage, and (3) analyzing the features’ relationship to crystal resolution (a proxy for quality). Based on these findings, a design strategy and score function for ranking designs within the Rosetta framework will be developed.  Second, the design strategy will be applied to SNase, a model protein that is easy to purify and well- behaved in crystallization and diffraction experiments. The designed proteins will be crystallized and the crystal structures will be solved, testing for improved resolution. Analysis of the resultant crystal structures will drive development of the design strategy.  Third, the design strategy will be applied on a bacterial gyrase, an antibiotic-target protein for which there are several drug-bound structures at low resolution, lacking sufficient detail to reveal key antibiotic– gyrase interactions. Preliminary data suggests that the designed gyrase mutants will yield high-resolution structures, permitting a better understanding of antibiotic–gyrase interactions, with implications for drug design.  Should the method be successful, it will be immediately applicable to ~26,000 structures in the Protein Data Bank, and countless structures that have not been published due to lack of resolution. Re-engineered, high-resolution structures of these proteins could yield structural data on molecular interactions pertinent to disease, drug development, and basic understanding of protein function. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop methods to improve low-resolution crystal structures of proteins to high-resolution sufficient (1) to resolve key mechanistic features of enzyme function and disease, and (2) to design or screen drug molecules. In addition to method development, we will pursue crystal structure of M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase in complex with relevant antibiotic drugs.",Computational Design of Crystal Lattice Interactions to Determine Recalcitrant Protein Structures,9644449,F31GM123616,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'DNA', 'DNA Gyrase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Free Energy', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solvents', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'functional gain', 'improved', 'insight', 'interfacial', 'macromolecule', 'method development', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research and development', 'structural biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,37308,0.15501437628574485
"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced. The work is enabled by a unique team which will use a diverse array of techniques, including molecular dynamics, computational data sciences, and experimental biochemistry, to develop tools that will broadly enable the scientific community.",A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins,9536053,R01GM125063,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell membrane', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Drug Targeting', 'Escherichia coli', 'Grain', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mycobacterium smegmatis', 'Nucleotides', 'Nutrient', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Shotguns', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biophysical properties', 'case-by-case basis', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'rhomboid', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,369690,0.05895738741165347
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month. The final aim describes how we will enable this community to make best use of UniProt, through user training, outreach and improved user interfaces, driven by user testing. Project narrative UniProt is the world’s leading resource of protein sequence and functional information, covering all species including Homo sapiens, model organisms and pathogens. UniProt annotates protein function using community-standard ontologies to support the interpretation of genomic and other datasets on which biomedical research and precision medicine depend.

"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules. In this project, we aim to develop rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical frameworks for such tasks and apply them to study proteins, RNAs and chromosomes.",Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes,9520279,R01GM126558,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Grain', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'database structure', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genome annotation', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'protein distribution', 'protein structure', 'shape analysis', 'success', 'tool development']",NIGMS,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,308003,0.10664986370136406
"Molecular basis of centriole duplication The centrosome, which plays a central role as the main microtubule (MT)-organizing center for animal cell division, is a membraneless organelle composed of a pair of orthogonally arranged MT-derived apparatus, called centrioles, and the surrounding pericentriolar material (PCM). In various eukaryotic organisms, PCM proteins are concentrically arranged around a centriole in a highly organized manner. Based on this observation, proper positioning and organization of PCM proteins may be important for promoting different cellular processes in a spatially regulated manner. Not surprisingly, aberrations in the function of PCM scaffolds are associated with many human diseases including cancer, microcephaly, ciliopathy, and dwarfism. At present, how this membraneless cellular architecture is assembled and how the centrosomal scaffold proteins display a cylindrical pattern of localization around a centriole remain unknown. The formation of a higher-order structure requires unusual biochemical and biophysical properties that allow a building-block molecule to establish the boundary of an assembled structure in an open cytosolic environment. Recent studies showed that a C. elegans centrosomal scaffold, Spd5, homomerizes to form a network-like assembly through its phase-separating ability. In addition, the D. melanogaster Centrosomin (Cnn) appears to form a network-like assembly that does not undergo dynamic turnover. However, both Spd5 and Cnn do not appear to form an organized higher-order architecture with a distinguishable morphology. We found that two of the human PCM scaffolds, Cep63 and Cep152, cooperate to generate a higher-order cylindrical self-assembly capable of recruiting their downstream components, such as Plk4, a key regulator of centriole duplication. Cooperative self-assembly of a three-dimensional cylindrical architecture by two distinct intracellular proteins is unprecedented. Since Cep152 is thought to function as a licensing factor for Plk4-mediated centriole biogenesis , investigating the mechanism of how Cep152 functions in conjunction with Cep63 to self-assemble a new structural entity will be important to comprehend the centrosomal architecture critically required for Plk4-dependent centriole duplication. n/a",Molecular basis of centriole duplication,9779945,ZIABC011518,"['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological Process', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell division', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centrioles', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dwarfism', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Goals', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Licensing Factor', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Microcephaly', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center', 'Microtubules', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scaffolding Protein', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'ciliopathy', 'genome integrity', 'human disease', 'macromolecular assembly', 'recruit', 'scaffold', 'self assembly', 'self organization', 'single molecule']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2018,721602,0.06262433153021692
"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9422220,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'computer based statistical methods', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2018,316515,0.11023408797719611
"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The same protein sequence can be encoded by more than one nucleic acid sequence.

"Centrosome Duplication and Maturation As a non-membrane bound organelle, the assembly of centrosomes must be driven by PPIs. These interactions are likely modified by highly regulated changes in protein binding affinity in a cell-type and cell-cycle dependent manner, which can in turn modulate centrosome behavior and function. We have focused on identifying PPIs among a core set of conserved centrosome proteins, classified as proteins of the centriole, the PCM and regulatory kinases. Previous high-throughput and small-scale interactions studies have suggested that there might be a limited number of PPIs among centrosome proteins and have raised the possibility that few interactions are used to construct a simple, ultimately static structure. Our data does not support this simplistic view of the centrosome. We have uncovered a large number of direct PPIs, dramatically expanding our understanding of the centrosome interaction landscape. This highly interconnected landscape suggests a much more complex centrosome assembly and regulatory process, which we suggest can be leveraged to perform a variety of specialized tasks dictated by a broad spectrum of cellular requirements.   In previous years we have focused our attention on Pericentrin-Like-Protein (PLP), Asterless (Asl), Cep135, and the critical centriole duplication kinase Plk4. In the past year, we have added the protein Ana2 and Cnn in collaboration with the labs of David Agard and Gregory Rogers. These studies have uncovered important regulatory mechanisms related to centriole duplication and PCM assembly. However, our main focus for the past year has been to determine how a proximal end of the centriole is established, and for what purpose.   Interestingly, the pericentriolar material (PCM), which organizes microtubules is frequently positioned at the proximal end of the centriole. How PCM is specifically localized to the proximal end, and if this localization has functional significance, remains largely unexplored. We have used the centrioles of spermatocytes in the Drosophila male germline, which grow to almost 2 microns, to interrogate how the Drosophila Pericentrin ortholog (PLP) is localized to the proximal end of the centriole, and test if this localization is critical for function. We find that the localization of PLP to the proximal end is achieved by limiting the availability of PLP protein to the earliest phases of centriole growth, before centriole elongation. Furthermore, plp transcript is also rapidly lost prior to centriole elongation. Exogenous expression of PLP under the control of promoters that specifically express during the elongation period, result in the deposition of PLP along the entire length of the centriole; promoters that express prior to elongation behave as wild type. Interestingly, during meiosis, centrioles with PLP inappropriately along their entire length also have PCM recruited along entire length, indicating that PLP is sufficient to instruct PCM localization. To determine if the positioning of PLP and PCM at the proximal end has a functional consequence, we followed centrioles as spermatocytes developed into spermatids. Through live cell imaging in developing testes, and careful staging of fixed tissue, we find that centrioles with PLP and PCM along the entire length are positioned such that the centriole is laterally associated with the nucleus as opposed to the normal proximal-end docking to the nucleus. This, to our knowledge, is the first demonstration that the proximal localizing of PCM serves a purpose  to ensure proper centriole-nucleus attachment in spermatids. Furthermore, our preliminary studies indicate that this improper centriole docking results in a major reduction in properly formed sperm. We are now testing the impact of mispositioning PCM on overall animal fertility.  By combining our interactome with in vivo experimental evidence in Drosophila, we demonstrate how large interaction information can lead to in depth mechanistic insight into macromolecular assemblies. Integrating protein localization, dynamics and functional data with direct PPI information and mutant analysis, we show that interactions can predict inter- and intra-molecular architecture, identify kinase substrates and uncover regulated interactions within the centrosome. Understanding the interaction landscape of the centrosome is a critical foundation needed to gain an understanding of the molecular basis for human diseases caused by dysfunction of centriole, centrosome and cilia proteins.  The diversity of centrosome-related diseases, such as microcephally, dwarfism, polycystic kidney disease and many others, can be best explained by loss of specific PPIs, rather than a simple complete loss of protein function stemming from a null mutation. We believe that our study will also guide new avenues of centrosome research that focus on the in-depth understanding of the diverse functions of these proteins, and could serve as a framework to explore other complex cellular processes. n/a",Centrosome Duplication and Maturation,9796002,ZIAHL006104,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemistry', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Centrioles', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosomes', 'Cilia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drosophila genus', 'Dwarfism', 'Ensure', 'Fertility', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Interphase', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Meiosis', 'Microcephaly', 'Microscopy', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Organelles', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Spermatids', 'Spermatocytes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Testis', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'cell type', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'live cell imaging', 'macromolecular assembly', 'male', 'mutant', 'null mutation', 'pericentrin', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'recruit', 'sperm cell', 'stem']",NHLBI,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",ZIA,2018,812494,0.0890503667744767
"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9375803,R01GM124559,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'forest', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,379776,0.11457715609186898
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship and to predict protein structures and interactions. The results will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as better understanding of disease processes, development of novel diagnostics and drugs, and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.",New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction,9336937,R01GM089753,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Family', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Homologous Gene', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Occupations', 'Play', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'Work', 'atomic interactions', 'base', 'biological research', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'monomer', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIGMS,TOYOTA TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE / CHICAGO,R01,2017,306425,0.16464235584081557
"Integrated Prediction and Validation of Protein Structures ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of three-dimensional protein structure is indispensable in biomedical research. Protein structure and function are intimately linked, and thus structure facilitates drug discovery, aids investigations of protein-protein interactions, informs mutagenesis analysis, guides protein engineering and the design of new proteins, and provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of disease. However, the number of protein sequences available in the genomic era far exceeds the capacity of the main experimental structure determination techniques of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, resulting in a substantial sequence- structure gap. We address this ever-widening gap by developing and disseminating novel protein structure modeling tools. This renewal project is a new collaboration between experts in computational modeling (Cheng) and experimental structural biology (Tanner). We plan to develop innovative, integrated machine learning (e.g., deep learning), data mining and statistical modeling methods to address major challenges in both template-based structure modeling and template-free (ab initio) structure modeling. We will apply these tools to enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, a group of enzymes that are involved in numerous important biological processes and implicated in many diseases due to mutations. The ALDH models will be experimentally validated using X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays. Furthermore, we will combine the modeling power of our structural Input-Output hidden Markov model with experimental small- angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to predict the tertiary structures of large multi-domain proteins. The integration of computational and experimental sciences in this project positions us uniquely in structure modeling space.

"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease.

"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions.

"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The cellular network and its environment govern cell and organism behavior and are fundamental to the comprehension of function, misfunction and drug discovery. Over the last few years, drugs were observed to often bind to more than one target; thus, poly-pharmacology approaches can be advantageous, complementing the ""one drug - one target"" strategy. Targeting drug discovery from the systems biology standpoint can help in studies of network effects of mono- and poly-pharmacology. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the usefulness of network description and tools for mono- and poly-pharmacology, and the ways through which protein interactions can help single- and multi-target drug discovery efforts. We further describe how, when combined with experimental data, modeled structural networks which can predict which proteins interact and provide the structures of their interfaces, can model the cellular pathways, and suggest which specific pathways are likely to be affected. Such structural networks may facilitate structure-based drug design; forecast side effects of drugs; and suggest how the effects of drug binding can propagate in multi-molecular complexes and pathways. Cellular functions are performed through protein-protein interactions; therefore, identification of these interactions is crucial for understanding biological processes. Recent studies suggest that knowledge-based approaches are more useful than ""blind"" docking for modeling at large scales. However, a caveat of knowledge-based approaches is that they treat molecules as rigid structures. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) offers a wealth of conformations. Here, we exploited an ensemble of the conformations in predictions by a knowledge-based method, PRISM. We tested ""difficult"" cases in a docking-benchmark data set, where the unbound and bound protein forms are structurally different. Considering alternative conformations for each protein, the percentage of successfully predicted interactions increased from about 26 to 66%, and 57% of the interactions were successfully predicted in an ""unbiased"" scenario, in which data related to the bound forms were not utilized. If the appropriate conformation, or relevant template interface, is unavailable in the PDB, PRISM could not predict the interaction successfully. The pace of the growth of the PDB promises a rapid increase of ensemble conformations emphasizing the merit of such knowledge-based ensemble strategies for higher success rates in protein-protein interaction predictions on an interactome scale. We constructed the structural network of ERK interacting proteins as a case study. We constructed and simulated a ""minimal proteome"" model using Langevin dynamics. It contains 206 essential protein types that were compiled from the literature. For comparison, we generated six proteomes with randomized concentrations. We found that the net charges and molecular weights of the proteins in the minimal genome are not random. The net charge of a protein decreases linearly with molecular weight, with small proteins being mostly positively charged and large proteins negatively charged. The protein copy numbers in the minimal genome have the tendency to maximize the number of protein-protein interactions in the network. Negatively charged proteins that tend to have larger sizes can provide a large collision cross-section allowing them to interact with other proteins; on the other hand, the smaller positively charged proteins could have higher diffusion speed and are more likely to collide with other proteins. Proteomes with random charge/mass populations form less stable clusters than those with experimental protein copy numbers. Our study suggests that ""proper"" populations of negatively and positively charged proteins are important for maintaining a protein-protein interaction network in a proteome. It is interesting to note that the minimal genome model based on the charge and mass of Escherichia coli may have alarger protein-protein interaction network than that based on the lower organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Proteins function through their interactions, and the availability of protein interaction networks could help in understanding cellular processes. However, the known structural data are limited and the classical network node-and-edge representation, where proteins are nodes and interactions are edges, shows only which proteins interact; not how they interact. Structural networks provide this information. Protein-protein interface structures can also indicate which binding partners can interact simultaneously and which are competitive, and can help forecasting potentially harmful drug side effects. Here, we use a powerful protein-protein interactions prediction tool which is able to carry out accurate predictions on the proteome scale to construct the structural network of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This knowledge-based method, PRISM, is motif-based, and is combined with flexible refinement and energy scoring. PRISM predicts protein interactions based on structural and evolutionary similarity to known protein interfaces. We focus on improvement of PRISM toward modeling of specific interaction of key proteins in cancer and inflammation pathways to figure out regulation in central processes in the cell. n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,9556287,ZIABC010442,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Inflammation', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Lower Organism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Modeling', 'Modeling of Cellular Pathways', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mono-S', 'Movement', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'biological research', 'blind', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'globular protein', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'method development', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'molecular dynamics', 'operation', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2017,151510,0.14036174269591217
"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å C-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations. Project Narrative We are combining experimental and computational approaches to produce a predictive understanding of protein folding and dynamics.

"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced. The work is enabled by a unique team which will use a diverse array of techniques, including molecular dynamics, computational data sciences, and experimental biochemistry, to develop tools that will broadly enable the scientific community.",A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins,9381212,R01GM125063,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell membrane', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Cereals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Drug Targeting', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mycobacterium smegmatis', 'Nucleotides', 'Nutrient', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Shotguns', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'biophysical properties', 'case-by-case basis', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'rhomboid', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,439690,0.05895738741165347
"Structural characterization of protein complexes involved in embryogenesis. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Birth defects, such as those effecting cardiovascular (e.g. Coarctation of the Aorta), nervous system (e.g. Spina bifida) and craniofacial development (e.g. Cleft Palate) are responsible for roughly 20% of infant deaths in the United States and place an exceeding burden on the health care system amounting to billions of dollars each year. Such defects are often the result of disruptions in embryogenesis, which depends on tight regulation of key pathways including Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, PAR, and Bone morphogenetic peptide/TGF beta. Many of the protein complexes involved in these pathways however lack detailed molecular characterization, and more still remain to be discovered. Large-scale proteomics efforts focused on embryonic tissues are beginning to systematically identify proteins in vast numbers. Using these data, I propose to develop new methods to structurally and functionally characterize protein complexes associated with embryogenesis. Specifically, I will develop novel computational tools (i) to datamine for proximal interactions (i.e. protein subcomplexes) as well as (ii) to calculate protein stoichiometry. I will then integrate this information to build structural models capable of both characterizing individual complex functions as well as identifying their role in developmental failure. These results will provide a greatly needed mechanistic understanding of the protein complexes associated with embryogenesis and potentially uncover therapeutic targets to treat developmental failures. Moreover, the methods developed here will provide the capability to analyze virtually any biological system and thus should have broad implications for the study of many diseases.

"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules. In this project, we aim to develop rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical frameworks for such tasks and apply them to study proteins, RNAs and chromosomes.",Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes,9460677,R01GM126558,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cereals', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'database structure', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genome annotation', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'protein distribution', 'protein structure', 'shape analysis', 'success', 'tool development']",NIGMS,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,308707,0.10664986370136406
"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The same protein sequence can be encoded by more than one nucleic acid sequence. Historically, “synonymous” changes in a nucleic acid sequence were thought to be “silent”, but it is now emerging that some synonymous changes can change the folding of the encoded protein, and/or its transport into a membrane. We will integrate novel computational analyses and laboratory experiments to uncover the connections between synonymous substitutions and protein production in the cell.",Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis,9315195,R01GM120733,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Alpha Cell', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homologous Protein', 'Informatics', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Side', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gene product', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2017,278100,0.11884763110987107

"Centrosome Duplication and Maturation To rectify the significant deficit in our understanding of the interactions of the centrosome, we have generated a detailed centrosome interactome by using a directed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen to identify the PPIs among 21 centrosome proteins. We use the information from our screen to gain an in vivo understanding of protein organization within the centrosome. We also demonstrate how the interactome can lead to the discovery of novel kinase substrates. Specifically, we have uncovered a centriole duplication independent role for the kinase Plk4, showing that it phosphorylates the centriole protein Cep135 to regulate its interaction with Asterless (Asl) and influence the radial positioning of Asl on the centriole.   As a non-membrane bound organelle, the assembly of centrosomes must be driven by PPIs. These interactions are likely modified by highly regulated changes in protein binding affinity in a cell-type and cell-cycle dependent manner, which can in turn modulate centrosome behavior and function. We have focused on identifying PPIs among a core set of conserved centrosome proteins, classified as proteins of the centriole, the PCM and regulatory kinases. Previous high-throughput and small-scale interactions studies have suggested that there might be a limited number of PPIs among centrosome proteins and have raised the possibility that few interactions are used to construct a simple, ultimately static structure. Our data does not support this simplistic view of the centrosome. We have uncovered a large number of direct PPIs, dramatically expanding our understanding of the centrosome interaction landscape. This highly interconnected landscape suggests a much more complex centrosome assembly and regulatory process, which we suggest can be leveraged to perform a variety of specialized tasks dictated by a broad spectrum of cellular requirements.  Some, if not most, of the interactions we identified must serve purposes beyond solidifying the final structure of the centrosome, since we observe interactions between proteins that appear to be quite distant from each other as determined by light microscopy. For example, we find an interaction between the C-terminus of Cep135, a core centriole protein, and the C-terminus of Cnn, a PCM protein. This interaction is not supported by the average position of these proteins in the final mother centrosome structure as determined by SIM. An alternative model raised by this interaction is that these proteins transiently bind during the daughter centriole assembly process. Furthermore, the daughter centriole forms adjacent to the proximal end of the mother centriole where the PCM is located. Therefore, the Cep135C-term-CnnC-term interaction might be required for concentrating Cep135 during centriole duplication.  To further illustrate that many interactions might be used transiently, we highlight the localization diversity of Sas-4 within the centrosome. Many of the Sas-4 structures we observed differ from the previously reported average position as a dot or ring. Furthermore, Sas-4 localization in S2 cells and the developing Drosophila wing disc, although similar, are not identical, illustrates a cell-type specific diversity in its localization. The variety of localizations we observe are consistent with Sas-4s many PPIs with centriole and PCM components, and its roles in centriole duplication and PCM recruitment. Taken together, we propose that interaction diversity begets functional diversity, not only for Sas-4, but for all centrosome proteins.    An unexpected finding from our screen was the low frequency with which FL proteins interacted in comparison to protein fragments. This discrepancy might help explain why so few interactions among centrosome proteins were identified in high-throughput Y2H screens. A number of studies have suggested that using protein fragments is advantageous for Y2H screens. Therefore the difference inthe interactions made by full-length protein and protein fragments may be illustrative of centrosome protein regulation and not simply a technical limitation of Y2H. An attractive model is that FL centrosome proteins are unable to interact with the full complement of their interaction partners, perhaps due to an autoinhibited confirmation, which might have been relieved by using protein fragments. One such example is our study on Cep135 and Asl, which show exactly this type of regulation. In this case, the N- and C-terminal fragments of Cep135, but not Cep135FL, could interact with AslC-term. We go on to show that phosphorylation of Cep135 by Plk4 relieves the autoinhibition present in FL Cep135 allowing it to interact with the AslC-term. We then show that in the absence of this regulated interaction in the fly, the positioning of Asl on the centriole is perturbed. Furthermore, we show that Plk4 is critical for this positioning. This is the first example of Plk4 playing a role in constructing or maintaining the organization of centriole proteins outside of its well-established role in initiating centriole duplication. While we show this role is partially via phosphorylation of Cep135, our data suggests additional unknown Plk4 substrates are important for regulating Asl positioning.  By combining our interactome with in vivo experimental evidence in Drosophila, we demonstrate how large interaction information can lead to in depth mechanistic insight into macromolecular assemblies. Integrating protein localization, dynamics and functional data with direct PPI information and mutant analysis, we show that interactions can predict inter- and intra-molecular architecture, identify kinase substrates and uncover regulated interactions within the centrosome. Understanding the interaction landscape of the centrosome is a critical foundation needed to gain an understanding of the molecular basis for human diseases caused by dysfunction of centriole, centrosome and cilia proteins.  The diversity of centrosome-related diseases, such as microcephally, dwarfism, polycystic kidney disease and many others, can be best explained by loss of specific PPIs, rather than a simple complete loss of protein function stemming from a null mutation. We believe that our study will also guide new avenues of centrosome research that focus on the in-depth understanding of the diverse functions of these proteins, and could serve as a framework to explore other complex cellular processes. n/a",Centrosome Duplication and Maturation,9572299,ZIAHL006104,"['Affinity', 'Alpha Cell', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemistry', 'C-terminal', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Centrioles', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosomes', 'Cilia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Daughter', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drosophila genus', 'Dwarfism', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Interphase', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Microcephaly', 'Microscopy', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Organelles', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radial', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Wing', 'Yeasts', 'cell type', 'fly', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light microscopy', 'macromolecular assembly', 'mutant', 'novel', 'null mutation', 'pericentrin', 'protein function', 'stem', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NHLBI,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",ZIA,2017,782566,0.13911194103854188

"Integrated Prediction and Validation of Protein Structures ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of three-dimensional protein structure is indispensable in biomedical research. Protein structure and function are intimately linked, and thus structure facilitates drug discovery, aids investigations of protein-protein interactions, informs mutagenesis analysis, guides protein engineering and the design of new proteins, and provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of disease. However, the number of protein sequences available in the genomic era far exceeds the capacity of the main experimental structure determination techniques of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, resulting in a substantial sequence- structure gap. We address this ever-widening gap by developing and disseminating novel protein structure modeling tools. This renewal project is a new collaboration between experts in computational modeling (Cheng) and experimental structural biology (Tanner). We plan to develop innovative, integrated machine learning (e.g., deep learning), data mining and statistical modeling methods to address major challenges in both template-based structure modeling and template-free (ab initio) structure modeling. We will apply these tools to enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, a group of enzymes that are involved in numerous important biological processes and implicated in many diseases due to mutations. The ALDH models will be experimentally validated using X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays. Furthermore, we will combine the modeling power of our structural Input-Output hidden Markov model with experimental small- angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to predict the tertiary structures of large multi-domain proteins. The integration of computational and experimental sciences in this project positions us uniquely in structure modeling space.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research.

"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The cellular network and its environment govern cell and organism behavior and are fundamental to the comprehension of function, misfunction and drug discovery. Over the last few years, drugs were observed to often bind to more than one target; thus, poly-pharmacology approaches can be advantageous, complementing the ""one drug - one target"" strategy. Targeting drug discovery from the systems biology standpoint can help in studies of network effects of mono- and poly-pharmacology. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the usefulness of network description and tools for mono- and poly-pharmacology, and the ways through which protein interactions can help single- and multi-target drug discovery efforts. We further describe how, when combined with experimental data, modeled structural networks which can predict which proteins interact and provide the structures of their interfaces, can model the cellular pathways, and suggest which specific pathways are likely to be affected. Such structural networks may facilitate structure-based drug design; forecast side effects of drugs; and suggest how the effects of drug binding can propagate in multi-molecular complexes and pathways. Cellular functions are performed through protein-protein interactions; therefore, identification of these interactions is crucial for understanding biological processes. Recent studies suggest that knowledge-based approaches are more useful than ""blind"" docking for modeling at large scales. However, a caveat of knowledge-based approaches is that they treat molecules as rigid structures. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) offers a wealth of conformations. Here, we exploited an ensemble of the conformations in predictions by a knowledge-based method, PRISM. We tested ""difficult"" cases in a docking-benchmark data set, where the unbound and bound protein forms are structurally different. Considering alternative conformations for each protein, the percentage of successfully predicted interactions increased from about 26 to 66%, and 57% of the interactions were successfully predicted in an ""unbiased"" scenario, in which data related to the bound forms were not utilized. If the appropriate conformation, or relevant template interface, is unavailable in the PDB, PRISM could not predict the interaction successfully. The pace of the growth of the PDB promises a rapid increase of ensemble conformations emphasizing the merit of such knowledge-based ensemble strategies for higher success rates in protein-protein interaction predictions on an interactome scale. We constructed the structural network of ERK interacting proteins as a case study. We constructed and simulated a ""minimal proteome"" model using Langevin dynamics. It contains 206 essential protein types that were compiled from the literature. For comparison, we generated six proteomes with randomized concentrations. We found that the net charges and molecular weights of the proteins in the minimal genome are not random. The net charge of a protein decreases linearly with molecular weight, with small proteins being mostly positively charged and large proteins negatively charged. The protein copy numbers in the minimal genome have the tendency to maximize the number of protein-protein interactions in the network. Negatively charged proteins that tend to have larger sizes can provide a large collision cross-section allowing them to interact with other proteins; on the other hand, the smaller positively charged proteins could have higher diffusion speed and are more likely to collide with other proteins. Proteomes with random charge/mass populations form less stable clusters than those with experimental protein copy numbers. Our study suggests that ""proper"" populations of negatively and positively charged proteins are important for maintaining a protein-protein interaction network in a proteome. It is interesting to note that the minimal genome model based on the charge and mass of Escherichia coli may have alarger protein-protein interaction network than that based on the lower organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Proteins function through their interactions, and the availability of protein interaction networks could help in understanding cellular processes. However, the known structural data are limited and the classical network node-and-edge representation, where proteins are nodes and interactions are edges, shows only which proteins interact; not how they interact. Structural networks provide this information. Protein-protein interface structures can also indicate which binding partners can interact simultaneously and which are competitive, and can help forecasting potentially harmful drug side effects. Here, we use a powerful protein-protein interactions prediction tool which is able to carry out accurate predictions on the proteome scale to construct the structural network of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This knowledge-based method, PRISM, is motif-based, and is combined with flexible refinement and energy scoring. PRISM predicts protein interactions based on structural and evolutionary similarity to known protein interfaces. We focus on improvement of PRISM toward modeling of specific interaction of key proteins in cancer and inflammation pathways to figure out regulation in central processes in the cell. n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,9343621,ZIABC010442,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Inflammation', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Lower Organism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Modeling', 'Modeling of Cellular Pathways', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mono-S', 'Movement', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'biological research', 'blind', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'globular protein', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'method development', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'molecular dynamics', 'operation', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2016,144330,0.14036174269591217
"Structural characterization of protein complexes involved in embryogenesis.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Birth defects, such as those effecting cardiovascular (e.g. Coarctation of the Aorta), nervous system (e.g. Spina bifida) and craniofacial development (e.g. Cleft Palate) are responsible for roughly 20% of infant deaths in the United States and place an exceeding burden on the health care system amounting to billions of dollars each year. Such defects are often the result of disruptions in embryogenesis, which depends on tight regulation of key pathways including Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, PAR, and Bone morphogenetic peptide/TGF beta. Many of the protein complexes involved in these pathways however lack detailed molecular characterization, and more still remain to be discovered. Large-scale proteomics efforts focused on embryonic tissues are beginning to systematically identify proteins in vast numbers. Using these data, I propose to develop new methods to structurally and functionally characterize protein complexes associated with embryogenesis. Specifically, I will develop novel computational tools (i) to datamine for proximal interactions (i.e. protein subcomplexes) as well as (ii) to calculate protein stoichiometry. I will then integrate this information to build structural models capable of both characterizing individual complex functions as well as identifying their role in developmental failure. These results will provide a greatly needed mechanistic understanding of the protein complexes associated with embryogenesis and potentially uncover therapeutic targets to treat developmental failures. Moreover, the methods developed here will provide the capability to analyze virtually any biological system and thus should have broad implications for the study of many diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Failures during embryogenesis result in debilitating birth defects, which are responsible for roughly 20% of the US infant mortality rate and billions of dollars in health care costs. I propose to investigate protein complexes that regulate embryogenesis using recent advances in proteomics as well as novel computational techniques of my own.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8972013,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,292404,0.13301939485205844
"Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Efficient production of functional proteins is arguably the most important function of a cell. Ribosomes synthesize proteins by decoding mRNA codons, and N-terminal portions of proteins can begin to fold even while synthesis is still underway. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon. Because synonymous codon substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, they have historically been regarded as “silent”. However, it is now known that some synonymous substitutions can disrupt the expression, folding, targeting and/or function of the encoded protein, although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Computational analyses have attempted to identify connections between the locations of synonymous codons and features of the encoded protein, but to date have yielded conflicting results, and there have been few attempts to experimentally test predictions made from these computational studies. Hence we currently lack a systematic understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. Establishing these connections would broadly transform our interpretation of synonymous codon substitutions, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human disease and synonymous substitutions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Establishing these connections would also enable the addition of coding sequence design as an integral aspect of the rational design of novel gene products (proteins). Thus, we aim to design an innovative integrative computational and experimental strategy with which to identify connections between codon usage patterns and protein biogenesis. We will search broadly for such connections, developing and applying several novel new approaches: (i) computational approaches to track, quantify and align synonymous codon usage patterns in homologous proteins, (ii) network approaches to map codon usage onto all levels of protein structure, and (iii) an innovative combination of broad and targeted experimental approaches to test the importance and specific effects of altering codon usage on protein biogenesis. Throughout the project, rigorous statistical methods will be applied to test the validity of identified connections, and cell-based experiments will be used to both test and refine hypotheses resulting from the computational analyses and develop new hypotheses that will feed back into the computational analyses. The goal of this project is to transform our understanding of the connections between synonymous codon usage and protein biogenesis. The endpoint for this project period is the development of a set of general principles for codon usage, including user-friendly open-source software to enable the biomedical community to analyze genes of interest for synonymous codon usage features likely to affect protein biogenesis. At the same time, our methodology will be generalizable, to allow the public to search for additional connections between sequence and/or network patterns and protein function, as well as for similar connections in other domains. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The same protein sequence can be encoded by more than one nucleic acid sequence. Historically, “synonymous” changes in a nucleic acid sequence were thought to be “silent”, but it is now emerging that some synonymous changes can change the folding of the encoded protein, and/or its transport into a membrane. We will integrate novel computational analyses and laboratory experiments to uncover the connections between synonymous substitutions and protein production in the cell.",Integrative computational framework for pattern mining in big -omics data: linking synonymous codon usage to protein biogenesis,9029632,R01GM120733,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homologous Protein', 'Informatics', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nucleic acid sequencing', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Side', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subcellular structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'design', 'feeding', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein transport', 'research study', 'skills', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2016,278100,0.11884763110987107
"Centrosome Duplication and Maturation To rectify the significant deficit in our understanding of the interactions of the centrosome, we have generated a detailed centrosome interactome by using a directed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen to identify the PPIs among 21 centrosome proteins. We use the information from our screen to gain an in vivo understanding of protein organization within the centrosome. We also demonstrate how the interactome can lead to the discovery of novel kinase substrates. Specifically, we have uncovered a centriole duplication independent role for the kinase Plk4, showing that it phosphorylates the centriole protein Cep135 to regulate its interaction with Asterless (Asl) and influence the radial positioning of Asl on the centriole.   As a non-membrane bound organelle, the assembly of centrosomes must be driven by PPIs. These interactions are likely modified by highly regulated changes in protein binding affinity in a cell-type and cell-cycle dependent manner, which can in turn modulate centrosome behavior and function. We have focused on identifying PPIs among a core set of conserved centrosome proteins, classified as proteins of the centriole, the PCM and regulatory kinases. Previous high-throughput and small-scale interactions studies have suggested that there might be a limited number of PPIs among centrosome proteins and have raised the possibility that few interactions are used to construct a simple, ultimately static structure. Our data does not support this simplistic view of the centrosome. We have uncovered a large number of direct PPIs, dramatically expanding our understanding of the centrosome interaction landscape. This highly interconnected landscape suggests a much more complex centrosome assembly and regulatory process, which we suggest can be leveraged to perform a variety of specialized tasks dictated by a broad spectrum of cellular requirements.  Some, if not most, of the interactions we identified must serve purposes beyond solidifying the final structure of the centrosome, since we observe interactions between proteins that appear to be quite distant from each other as determined by light microscopy. For example, we find an interaction between the C-terminus of Cep135, a core centriole protein, and the C-terminus of Cnn, a PCM protein. This interaction is not supported by the average position of these proteins in the final mother centrosome structure as determined by SIM. An alternative model raised by this interaction is that these proteins transiently bind during the daughter centriole assembly process. Furthermore, the daughter centriole forms adjacent to the proximal end of the mother centriole where the PCM is located. Therefore, the Cep135C-term-CnnC-term interaction might be required for concentrating Cep135 during centriole duplication.  To further illustrate that many interactions might be used transiently, we highlight the localization diversity of Sas-4 within the centrosome. Many of the Sas-4 structures we observed differ from the previously reported average position as a dot or ring. Furthermore, Sas-4 localization in S2 cells and the developing Drosophila wing disc, although similar, are not identical, illustrates a cell-type specific diversity in its localization. The variety of localizations we observe are consistent with Sas-4s many PPIs with centriole and PCM components, and its roles in centriole duplication and PCM recruitment. Taken together, we propose that interaction diversity begets functional diversity, not only for Sas-4, but for all centrosome proteins.    An unexpected finding from our screen was the low frequency with which FL proteins interacted in comparison to protein fragments. This discrepancy might help explain why so few interactions among centrosome proteins were identified in high-throughput Y2H screens. A number of studies have suggested that using protein fragments is advantageous for Y2H screens. Therefore the difference in the interactions made by full-length protein and protein fragments may be illustrative of centrosome protein regulation and not simply a technical limitation of Y2H. An attractive model is that FL centrosome proteins are unable to interact with the full complement of their interaction partners, perhaps due to an autoinhibited confirmation, which might have been relieved by using protein fragments. One such example is our study on Cep135 and Asl, which show exactly this type of regulation. In this case, the N- and C-terminal fragments of Cep135, but not Cep135FL, could interact with AslC-term. We go on to show that phosphorylation of Cep135 by Plk4 relieves the autoinhibition present in FL Cep135 allowing it to interact with the AslC-term. We then show that in the absence of this regulated interaction in the fly, the positioning of Asl on the centriole is perturbed. Furthermore, we show that Plk4 is critical for this positioning. This is the first example of Plk4 playing a role in constructing or maintaining the organization of centriole proteins outside of its well-established role in initiating centriole duplication. While we show this role is partially via phosphorylation of Cep135, our data suggests additional unknown Plk4 substrates are important for regulating Asl positioning.  By combining our interactome with in vivo experimental evidence in Drosophila, we demonstrate how large interaction information can lead to in depth mechanistic insight into macromolecular assemblies. Integrating protein localization, dynamics and functional data with direct PPI information and mutant analysis, we show that interactions can predict inter- and intra-molecular architecture, identify kinase substrates and uncover regulated interactions within the centrosome. Understanding the interaction landscape of the centrosome is a critical foundation needed to gain an understanding of the molecular basis for human diseases caused by dysfunction of centriole, centrosome and cilia proteins.  The diversity of centrosome-related diseases, such as microcephally, dwarfism, polycystic kidney disease and many others, can be best explained by loss of specific PPIs, rather than a simple complete loss of protein function stemming from a null mutation. We believe that our study will also guide new avenues of centrosome research that focus on the in-depth understanding of the diverse functions of these proteins, and could serve as a framework to explore other complex cellular processes. n/a",Centrosome Duplication and Maturation,9354308,ZIAHL006104,"['Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemistry', 'C-terminal', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Centrioles', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosomes', 'Cilia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Daughter', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drosophila genus', 'Dwarfism', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Interphase', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Microcephaly', 'Microscopy', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Organelles', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein C', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radial', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Wing', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cell type', 'fly', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'light microscopy', 'macromolecular assembly', 'mutant', 'novel', 'null mutation', 'pericentrin', 'protein function', 'stem', 'trafficking', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NHLBI,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",ZIA,2016,852688,0.13911194103854188
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship and to predict protein structures and interactions. The results will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as better understanding of disease processes, development of novel diagnostics and drugs, and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.",New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction,9030836,R01GM089753,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Homologous Gene', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Occupations', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'Work', 'atomic interactions', 'base', 'biological research', 'deep field survey', 'human disease', 'improved', 'monomer', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIGMS,TOYOTA TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE / CHICAGO,R01,2015,268175,0.16464235584081557
"Integrated Prediction and Validation of Protein Structures ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of three-dimensional protein structure is indispensable in biomedical research. Protein structure and function are intimately linked, and thus structure facilitates drug discovery, aids investigations of protein-protein interactions, informs mutagenesis analysis, guides protein engineering and the design of new proteins, and provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of disease. However, the number of protein sequences available in the genomic era far exceeds the capacity of the main experimental structure determination techniques of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, resulting in a substantial sequence- structure gap. We address this ever-widening gap by developing and disseminating novel protein structure modeling tools. This renewal project is a new collaboration between experts in computational modeling (Cheng) and experimental structural biology (Tanner). We plan to develop innovative, integrated machine learning (e.g., deep learning), data mining and statistical modeling methods to address major challenges in both template-based structure modeling and template-free (ab initio) structure modeling. We will apply these tools to enzymes in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, a group of enzymes that are involved in numerous important biological processes and implicated in many diseases due to mutations. The ALDH models will be experimentally validated using X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays. Furthermore, we will combine the modeling power of our structural Input-Output hidden Markov model with experimental small- angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to predict the tertiary structures of large multi-domain proteins.

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1 The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.",Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome,8841004,R01MH094564,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Panic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological Side Effects', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Thinking', 'Viral Cancer', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'body-mind', 'brain behavior', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychological', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,357427,0.05811890181475129
"Improving Modeling by Learning from Details of High Accuracy Protein Structures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The functions of proteins depend exquisitely on their structure, with details at the 0.1 � scale influencing enzyme catalysis, disease-causing mutations, and drug recognition. For this reason, having detailed and accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and the NIH funded the Protein Structure Initiative with the goal of obtaining models for every protein structure with an accuracy approaching that of a high-resolution crystal structure. Current technology for template-based modeling is powerful, but cannot yet deliver ""near-crystal-structure"" quality. Tests show that the best minimization routines still fall short of consistently producing protein models for close homologs that approach within ~1 � rmsd of the 'native' structure as ultimately revealed by crystal structures. To help break through this 1 � barrier, during the previous period of support we used ultrahigh-resolution structures to create a library of conformation- dependent ideal geometry functions for the protein backbone, and showed that its use improves the quality of protein crystal structures and holds promise to improve template-based model refinement. We also discovered that ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures are a rich source of details about protein structure that are not accurately attainable from structures in the ~1.5-2 � resolution range and thus have not yet been fully accounted for in current energy functions. Here, our central hypothesis is that a major step forward in template-based modeling accuracy will come from identifying and explicitly taking into account detailed features of protein covalent geometry, conformation and non-covalent packing interactions that have not yet been characterized, and can now be gleaned from the study of highly accurate ultrahigh-resolution protein structures. The overall goal of our proposal is to mine such information so it can be used to improve the accuracy of predictive modeling. With many ultrahigh-resolution structures now available, the time is ripe to achieve this goal by pursuing three specific aims related to (1) extending the impact of the 'ideal geometry function' paradigm by creating, optimizing, and implementing conformation- dependent libraries accounting for peptide planarity, side chains, and cis-peptides, (2) mining ultrahigh- resolution crystal structures to glean information for next-generation empirical energy functions, and (3) analyzing ultrahigh-resolution protein structures solved in varying environments to produce a set of benchmark test cases and developing residue level assessment tools to use with these test cases to evaluate and hone template-based modeling refinement applications. This proposed work is low cost and low risk, and has a high likelihood of substantial impact as it provides basic information that can be widely incorporated into predictive and experimental modeling applications to improve their accuracy. It is also distinct from major efforts being invested into template-based modeling. Introducing this greater level of realism is a prerequisite to improving the refinement step of template-based modeling and achieving the goals of the Protein Structure Initiative. Proteins carry out the work that gets done inside of cells, so figuring out what they look like helps us understand things like how drugs work and how to design new drugs that will work even better. It is not practical to experimentally determine every protein structure, so having reliable ways to use computers to predict their structures is quite important. Current methods are not quite accurate enough, and the goal of this work is to look carefully at the best known protein structures to learn from their exact features how we can improve prediction technology to get the details right.",Improving Modeling by Learning from Details of High Accuracy Protein Structures,8895978,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Cells', 'Computers', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Formulations', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Experimental Models', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Homologous Gene', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'model building', 'molecular mechanics', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool', 'trend', 'ultra high resolution']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,206832,0.15451078000861582
"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The cellular network and its environment govern cell and organism behavior and are fundamental to the comprehension of function, misfunction and drug discovery. Over the last few years, drugs were observed to often bind to more than one target; thus, poly-pharmacology approaches can be advantageous, complementing the ""one drug - one target"" strategy. Targeting drug discovery from the systems biology standpoint can help in studies of network effects of mono- and poly-pharmacology. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the usefulness of network description and tools for mono- and poly-pharmacology, and the ways through which protein interactions can help single- and multi-target drug discovery efforts. We further describe how, when combined with experimental data, modeled structural networks which can predict which proteins interact and provide the structures of their interfaces, can model the cellular pathways, and suggest which specific pathways are likely to be affected. Such structural networks may facilitate structure-based drug design; forecast side effects of drugs; and suggest how the effects of drug binding can propagate in multi-molecular complexes and pathways. Cellular functions are performed through protein-protein interactions; therefore, identification of these interactions is crucial for understanding biological processes. Recent studies suggest that knowledge-based approaches are more useful than ""blind"" docking for modeling at large scales. However, a caveat of knowledge-based approaches is that they treat molecules as rigid structures. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) offers a wealth of conformations. Here, we exploited an ensemble of the conformations in predictions by a knowledge-based method, PRISM. We tested ""difficult"" cases in a docking-benchmark data set, where the unbound and bound protein forms are structurally different. Considering alternative conformations for each protein, the percentage of successfully predicted interactions increased from about 26 to 66%, and 57% of the interactions were successfully predicted in an ""unbiased"" scenario, in which data related to the bound forms were not utilized. If the appropriate conformation, or relevant template interface, is unavailable in the PDB, PRISM could not predict the interaction successfully. The pace of the growth of the PDB promises a rapid increase of ensemble conformations emphasizing the merit of such knowledge-based ensemble strategies for higher success rates in protein-protein interaction predictions on an interactome scale. We constructed the structural network of ERK interacting proteins as a case study. We constructed and simulated a ""minimal proteome"" model using Langevin dynamics. It contains 206 essential protein types that were compiled from the literature. For comparison, we generated six proteomes with randomized concentrations. We found that the net charges and molecular weights of the proteins in the minimal genome are not random. The net charge of a protein decreases linearly with molecular weight, with small proteins being mostly positively charged and large proteins negatively charged. The protein copy numbers in the minimal genome have the tendency to maximize the number of protein-protein interactions in the network. Negatively charged proteins that tend to have larger sizes can provide a large collision cross-section allowing them to interact with other proteins; on the other hand, the smaller positively charged proteins could have higher diffusion speed and are more likely to collide with other proteins. Proteomes with random charge/mass populations form less stable clusters than those with experimental protein copy numbers. Our study suggests that ""proper"" populations of negatively and positively charged proteins are important for maintaining a protein-protein interaction network in a proteome. It is interesting to note that the minimal genome model based on the charge and mass of Escherichia coli may have alarger protein-protein interaction network than that based on the lower organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Proteins function through their interactions, and the availability of protein interaction networks could help in understanding cellular processes. However, the known structural data are limited and the classical network node-and-edge representation, where proteins are nodes and interactions are edges, shows only which proteins interact; not how they interact. Structural networks provide this information. Protein-protein interface structures can also indicate which binding partners can interact simultaneously and which are competitive, and can help forecasting potentially harmful drug side effects. Here, we use a powerful protein-protein interactions prediction tool which is able to carry out accurate predictions on the proteome scale to construct the structural network of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This knowledge-based method, PRISM, is motif-based, and is combined with flexible refinement and energy scoring. PRISM predicts protein interactions based on structural and evolutionary similarity to known protein interfaces. We focus on improvement of PRISM toward modeling of specific interaction of key proteins in cancer and inflammation pathways to figure out regulation in central processes in the cell. n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,9153572,ZIABC010442,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'CCR', 'Case Study', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Inflammation', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Lower Organism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Modeling', 'Modeling of Cellular Pathways', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mono-S', 'Movement', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'biological research', 'blind', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'globular protein', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'method development', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'molecular dynamics', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2015,109912,0.14036174269591217
"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the �2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant. G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.",Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors,8895982,R01GM095496,"['ADRB2 gene', 'Adrenergic Receptor', 'Behavior', 'Biophysics', 'CNR2 gene', 'Cell Signaling Process', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dimerization', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Family', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hydration status', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Opsin', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Activation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Running', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Water', 'Work', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'laptop', 'mammalian genome', 'metarhodopsin I', 'metarhodopsin II', 'molecular dynamics', 'multi-scale modeling', 'network models', 'novel', 'protein structure', 'receptor function', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'supercomputer', 'temporal measurement', 'therapeutic development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2015,262650,0.05751032117204174
"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8773597,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,291815,0.13301939485205844
"miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS ABSTRACT: ""miRNA in CSF of CFS""  Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles (Figure 1) Figure 1. Exosome formation. that are released from cells and mediate cell-to-cell transfer of short (22-25 nucleotides), noncoding, message inhibitory RNAs (miRNAs), genomic DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. The exosome surface has CD9, CD63, CD81 and other ligands that bind to integrins and other receptors on endothelium and other target cells. The exosome and target cell membranes fuse and miRNAs are released into the cytoplasm. Proinflammatory roles include transport of transforming growth factor-¿, and secretion of nitric oxide, reactive oxidant species, IL-1¿ and IL-18. Exosomes may act as circulating hormone- or virus-like inflammasomes to transmit injury signals in organs such as the brain. Pre- and post- synaptic neurons and glia have active exosome systems that contribute to neural plasticity, but that also transport amyloid, tau and prion proteins and rabies viruses.  miRNAs are products of short genes that are scattered throughout the genome. They bind to precise sequences in selected mRNAs. The binding prevents translation of the target mRNA and prevents protein synthesis. Over 1500 human miRNAs regulate about 50% of known proteins in cell-specific fashion. Exosome miRNAs may initiate, expand, and maintain dysfunctional phenotypes by preventing the expression of critical proteins in targeted cells. miRNAs may be biomarkers of aging, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. In human synapses, ten miRNAs regulate 80% of the 242 presynaptic and 304 post-synaptic proteins. Analysis of pooled specimens of cerebrospinal fluid by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS) identified 133 unique miRNAs. However, NGS is currently inefficient for studying the patterns of miRNAs from individual subjects. This is because the yield of miRNA is low so that >2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid per individual subject may be needed, or the samples pooled between subjects. Therefore, we propose to use quantitative PCR of miRNAs for this cerebrospinal fluid study.  Exosome proteins include RNA-binding heat shock and other cytoplasmic proteins; cell surface receptors such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HLA-G; and other transmembrane proteins. These may reveal the nature of the cell type that secreted the exosome.  Preliminary Data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also met CFS criteria have demonstrated significant, specific, central nervous system dysfunction. GWI subsets have been identified. miRNA contributes to these GWI subsets. This suggests objectively defined CFS phenotypes may also be discovered and discriminated by miRNA patterns (""biosignatures""). Exosome RNA, protein, and lipid components can be purified from fresh and -80¿C frozen CSF. NGS was performed on cerebrospinal fluid from sedentary control (SC) subjects at rest and two subsets of GWI subjects defined by their magnetic resonance imaging and responses to exercise. The 3 groups had unique miRNA patterns. MIR22 had equivalent levels in SC and the Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (START) and Stress Test Originated Phantom Perception (STOPP) specimens. Eleven miRNAs were found in only in SC. START had 7 unique miRNAs, and STOPP had 2 unique miRNAs. These patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of exercise-induced malaise, pain, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction as well as being phenotype - specific biomarkers. These data from GWI with CFS suggest phenotypes and specific miRNAs biomarkers in CFS.  Objective. Like GWI, CFS is a heterogenous disorder with latent phenotypes that can be identified from specific combinations of miRNAs expressed in cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. This unique hypothesis presumes that subsets of CFS have specific patterns of brain cell miRNAs. Distinct patterns of exosome miRNA and protein expression will discern CFS subjects from SC, and provide biomarkers for diagnosis. Exosome proteins may identify presynaptic, postsynaptic, microglial, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cells of origin. Drugs that target exosome biology may be beneficial in CFS or selected CFS phenotypes.  SPECIFIC AIM 1: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q- PCR) to identify the patterns of 380 miRNAs expressed in individual CFS and SC subjects before and after exercise. Determine patterns that discriminate CFS from SC, and identify latent phenotypes of CFS subjects. Characterize the miRNA-regulated proteins and infer the consequences for CFS brain biology.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and purify their proteins. Perform mass spectrometry for proteomic identification of exosome proteins. Determine the potential sources of the exosomes based on these proteins, and potential target cells based on the nature of the exosome surface receptors, transmembrane and intravesicular proteins. PROJECT NARRATIVE   miRNAs (messenger inhibiting RNA) in cerebrospinal fluid from Gulf War Illness subjects who also  met CFS criteria was significantly altered compared to sedentary control subjects.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs. Protein modeling is also widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry and integrated into most stages of pharmaceutical research.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses.  Our Specific Aims are as follows:  1. To develop software for automatic text mining and information extraction.  2. To conduct bioinformatic analyses and molecular biological experiments for TC knowledge expansion.  3. To interconnect TCDB bidirectionally with other relevant databases, thereby creating a  ""network"" of knowledge from current ""island"" databases.  4. To use multiple approaches to derive reliable functional predictions as guides for future  research.  5. To utilize a newly formed TCDB advisory board and establish a plan for modernization and  sustainability. These goals are top priorities for rendering TCDB increasingly useful to the scientific community.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TCDB is a database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematized information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport of salts, nutrients, toxins, drugs and macromolecules. It is the only IUBMB approved system for classifying transport proteins.

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1        The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.

"Improving Modeling by Learning from Details of High Accuracy Protein Structures     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The functions of proteins depend exquisitely on their structure, with details at the 0.1 ¿ scale influencing enzyme catalysis, disease-causing mutations, and drug recognition. For this reason, having detailed and accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and the NIH funded the Protein Structure Initiative with the goal of obtaining models for every protein structure with an accuracy approaching that of a high-resolution crystal structure. Current technology for template-based modeling is powerful, but cannot yet deliver ""near-crystal-structure"" quality. Tests show that the best minimization routines still fall short of consistently producing protein models for close homologs that approach within ~1 ¿ rmsd of the 'native' structure as ultimately revealed by crystal structures. To help break through this 1 ¿ barrier, during the previous period of support we used ultrahigh-resolution structures to create a library of conformation- dependent ideal geometry functions for the protein backbone, and showed that its use improves the quality of protein crystal structures and holds promise to improve template-based model refinement. We also discovered that ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures are a rich source of details about protein structure that are not accurately attainable from structures in the ~1.5-2 ¿ resolution range and thus have not yet been fully accounted for in current energy functions. Here, our central hypothesis is that a major step forward in template-based modeling accuracy will come from identifying and explicitly taking into account detailed features of protein covalent geometry, conformation and non-covalent packing interactions that have not yet been characterized, and can now be gleaned from the study of highly accurate ultrahigh-resolution protein structures. The overall goal of our proposal is to mine such information so it can be used to improve the accuracy of predictive modeling. With many ultrahigh-resolution structures now available, the time is ripe to achieve this goal by pursuing three specific aims related to (1) extending the impact of the 'ideal geometry function' paradigm by creating, optimizing, and implementing conformation- dependent libraries accounting for peptide planarity, side chains, and cis-peptides, (2) mining ultrahigh- resolution crystal structures to glean information for next-generation empirical energy functions, and (3) analyzing ultrahigh-resolution protein structures solved in varying environments to produce a set of benchmark test cases and developing residue level assessment tools to use with these test cases to evaluate and hone template-based modeling refinement applications. This proposed work is low cost and low risk, and has a high likelihood of substantial impact as it provides basic information that can be widely incorporated into predictive and experimental modeling applications to improve their accuracy. It is also distinct from major efforts being invested into template-based modeling. Introducing this greater level of realism is a prerequisite to improving the refinement step of template-based modeling and achieving the goals of the Protein Structure Initiative.           Proteins carry out the work that gets done inside of cells, so figuring out what they look like helps us understand things like how drugs work and how to design new drugs that will work even better. It is not practical to experimentally determine every protein structure, so having reliable ways to use computers to predict their structures is quite important. Current methods are not quite accurate enough, and the goal of this work is to look carefully at the best known protein structures to learn from their exact features how we can improve prediction technology to get the details right.

"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The cellular network and its environment govern cell and organism behavior and are fundamental to the comprehension of function, misfunction and drug discovery. Over the last few years, drugs were observed to often bind to more than one target; thus, poly-pharmacology approaches can be advantageous, complementing the ""one drug - one target"" strategy. Targeting drug discovery from the systems biology standpoint can help in studies of network effects of mono- and poly-pharmacology. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the usefulness of network description and tools for mono- and poly-pharmacology, and the ways through which protein interactions can help single- and multi-target drug discovery efforts. We further describe how, when combined with experimental data, modeled structural networks which can predict which proteins interact and provide the structures of their interfaces, can model the cellular pathways, and suggest which specific pathways are likely to be affected. Such structural networks may facilitate structure-based drug design; forecast side effects of drugs; and suggest how the effects of drug binding can propagate in multi-molecular complexes and pathways. Cellular functions are performed through protein-protein interactions; therefore, identification of these interactions is crucial for understanding biological processes. Recent studies suggest that knowledge-based approaches are more useful than ""blind"" docking for modeling at large scales. However, a caveat of knowledge-based approaches is that they treat molecules as rigid structures. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) offers a wealth of conformations. Here, we exploited an ensemble of the conformations in predictions by a knowledge-based method, PRISM. We tested ""difficult"" cases in a docking-benchmark data set, where the unbound and bound protein forms are structurally different. Considering alternative conformations for each protein, the percentage of successfully predicted interactions increased from about 26 to 66%, and 57% of the interactions were successfully predicted in an ""unbiased"" scenario, in which data related to the bound forms were not utilized. If the appropriate conformation, or relevant template interface, is unavailable in the PDB, PRISM could not predict the interaction successfully. The pace of the growth of the PDB promises a rapid increase of ensemble conformations emphasizing the merit of such knowledge-based ensemble strategies for higher success rates in protein-protein interaction predictions on an interactome scale. We constructed the structural network of ERK interacting proteins as a case study. We constructed and simulated a ""minimal proteome"" model using Langevin dynamics. It contains 206 essential protein types that were compiled from the literature. For comparison, we generated six proteomes with randomized concentrations. We found that the net charges and molecular weights of the proteins in the minimal genome are not random. The net charge of a protein decreases linearly with molecular weight, with small proteins being mostly positively charged and large proteins negatively charged. The protein copy numbers in the minimal genome have the tendency to maximize the number of protein-protein interactions in the network. Negatively charged proteins that tend to have larger sizes can provide a large collision cross-section allowing them to interact with other proteins; on the other hand, the smaller positively charged proteins could have higher diffusion speed and are more likely to collide with other proteins. Proteomes with random charge/mass populations form less stable clusters than those with experimental protein copy numbers. Our study suggests that ""proper"" populations of negatively and positively charged proteins are important for maintaining a protein-protein interaction network in a proteome. It is interesting to note that the minimal genome model based on the charge and mass of Escherichia coli may have alarger protein-protein interaction network than that based on the lower organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Proteins function through their interactions, and the availability of protein interaction networks could help in understanding cellular processes. However, the known structural data are limited and the classical network node-and-edge representation, where proteins are nodes and interactions are edges, shows only which proteins interact; not how they interact. Structural networks provide this information. Protein-protein interface structures can also indicate which binding partners can interact simultaneously and which are competitive, and can help forecasting potentially harmful drug side effects. Here, we use a powerful protein-protein interactions prediction tool which is able to carry out accurate predictions on the proteome scale to construct the structural network of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This knowledge-based method, PRISM, is motif-based, and is combined with flexible refinement and energy scoring. PRISM predicts protein interactions based on structural and evolutionary similarity to known protein interfaces. We focus on improvement of PRISM toward modeling of specific interaction of key proteins in cancer and inflammation pathways to figure out regulation in central processes in the cell. n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,8937737,ZIABC010442,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'CCR', 'Case Study', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Inflammation', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Lower Organism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Modeling', 'Modeling of Cellular Pathways', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mono-S', 'Movement', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'biological research', 'blind', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'globular protein', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'method development', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'molecular dynamics', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2014,108747,0.14036174269591217
"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.        G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.            ",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8588329,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,291243,0.13301939485205844
"miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS ABSTRACT: ""miRNA in CSF of CFS""   Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles (Figure 1) Figure 1. Exosome formation.  that are released from cells and mediate cell-to-cell transfer of  short (22-25 nucleotides), noncoding, message inhibitory RNAs  (miRNAs), genomic DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. The  exosome surface has CD9, CD63, CD81 and other ligands that  bind to integrins and other receptors on endothelium and other  target cells. The exosome and target cell membranes fuse and  miRNAs are released into the cytoplasm. Proinflammatory roles  include transport of transforming growth factor-ß, and secretion of  nitric oxide, reactive oxidant species, IL-1ß and IL-18. Exosomes  may act as circulating hormone- or virus-like inflammasomes to  transmit injury signals in organs such as the brain. Pre- and post-  synaptic neurons and glia have active exosome systems that contribute to neural plasticity, but that also  transport amyloid, tau and prion proteins and rabies viruses.   miRNAs are products of short genes that are scattered throughout the genome. They bind to precise  sequences in selected mRNAs. The binding prevents translation of the target mRNA and prevents protein  synthesis. Over 1500 human miRNAs regulate about 50% of known proteins in cell-specific fashion.  Exosome miRNAs may initiate, expand, and maintain dysfunctional phenotypes by preventing the expression  of critical proteins in targeted cells. miRNAs may be biomarkers of aging, mild cognitive impairment,  Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. In human synapses, ten miRNAs regulate  80% of the 242 presynaptic and 304 post-synaptic proteins. Analysis of pooled specimens of cerebrospinal  fluid by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS) identified 133 unique miRNAs. However, NGS is currently  inefficient for studying the patterns of miRNAs from individual subjects. This is because the yield of miRNA is  low so that >2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid per individual subject may be needed, or the samples pooled between  subjects. Therefore, we propose to use quantitative PCR of miRNAs for this cerebrospinal fluid study.   Exosome proteins include RNA-binding heat shock and other cytoplasmic proteins; cell surface  receptors such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HLA-G; and other transmembrane proteins. These may reveal the  nature of the cell type that secreted the exosome.   Preliminary Data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also met  CFS criteria have demonstrated significant, specific, central nervous system dysfunction. GWI subsets have  been identified. miRNA contributes to these GWI subsets. This suggests objectively defined CFS phenotypes  may also be discovered and discriminated by miRNA patterns (""biosignatures""). Exosome RNA, protein, and  lipid components can be purified from fresh and -80°C frozen CSF. NGS was performed on cerebrospinal fluid  from sedentary control (SC) subjects at rest and two subsets of GWI subjects defined by their magnetic  resonance imaging and responses to exercise. The 3 groups had unique miRNA patterns. MIR22 had  equivalent levels in SC and the Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (START) and Stress Test  Originated Phantom Perception (STOPP) specimens. Eleven miRNAs were found in only in SC. START had 7  unique miRNAs, and STOPP had 2 unique miRNAs. These patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of  exercise-induced malaise, pain, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction as well as being phenotype - specific  biomarkers. These data from GWI with CFS suggest phenotypes and specific miRNAs biomarkers in CFS.   Objective. Like GWI, CFS is a heterogenous disorder with latent phenotypes that can be identified  from specific combinations of miRNAs expressed in cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. This unique hypothesis  presumes that subsets of CFS have specific patterns of brain cell miRNAs. Distinct patterns of exosome  miRNA and protein expression will discern CFS subjects from SC, and provide biomarkers for diagnosis.  Exosome proteins may identify presynaptic, postsynaptic, microglial, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cells of  origin. Drugs that target exosome biology may be beneficial in CFS or selected CFS phenotypes.   SPECIFIC AIM 1: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-  PCR) to identify the patterns of 380 miRNAs expressed in individual CFS and SC subjects before and after  exercise. Determine patterns that discriminate CFS from SC, and identify latent phenotypes of CFS subjects.  Characterize the miRNA-regulated proteins and infer the consequences for CFS brain biology.   SPECIFIC AIM 2: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and purify their proteins. Perform mass  spectrometry for proteomic identification of exosome proteins. Determine the potential sources of the  exosomes based on these proteins, and potential target cells based on the nature of the exosome surface  receptors, transmembrane and intravesicular proteins. PROJECT NARRATIVE  miRNAs (messenger inhibiting RNA) in cerebrospinal fluid from Gulf War Illness subjects who also  met CFS criteria was significantly altered compared to sedentary control subjects. Two GWI/CFS  phenotypes were identified. This suggests miRNA may provide objective insights into CFS  pathophysiology, biomarkers, and potential mechanisms and future treatments. The miRNAs are  contained in lipid-bound vesicles, or exosomes. We will assay the proteins in the exosomes to  identify the cells of origin and potential targets for these enveloped virus-like microvesicles.",miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS,8752205,R21NS088138,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Anterior', 'Astrocytes', 'Atrophic', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Back', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bilateral', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'CD81 gene', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Cognitive', 'Conscious', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoplasmic Protein', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dysesthesias', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gulf War', 'HLA G antigen', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Integrins', 'Interleukin-18', 'Ligand Binding', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Lipid Binding', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prions', 'Production', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rabies virus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Stress Tests', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Testing', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Translations', 'Vesicle', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'base', 'biosignature', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'exhaustion', 'hemodynamics', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'prevent', 'protein expression', 'receptor', 'response', 'sedentary', 'tau Proteins', 'white matter']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,272125,0.06853542638284335
"Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of protein structure from the amino acid sequence is one of the most important and challenging problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. With the exponential growth of protein sequences without solved protein structures in the post-genomic era, accurate protein structure prediction methods and tools are in urgent need. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach to advance protein structure prediction at the 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) levels. At the 1D level, novel information such as domain evolution signals, alternative gene splicing sites, and 2D protein contact map will be used to predict protein domain boundaries from the sequences. At the 2D level, new methods such as residue contact propagation, machine learning boosting, linear programming, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations will be used to advance residue-residue contact prediction for a domain, or a protein. At the 3D level, 2D contact prediction, fold recognition via machine learning, and multi-template combination will be used to enhance both template-based and ab initio structure prediction. Finally, knowledge-based statistical machine learning methods and model combination algorithms will be developed to reliably evaluate and refine the quality of predicted protein structural models. One of several innovative aspects of this approach is to integrate 1D, 2D, and 3D predictions in order to improve each other through protein structural unit - domains. The 1D, 2D, and 3D protein structure prediction methods will be implemented as user-friendly software packages and web services released to the scientific community. These tools and web services will be useful for protein structure prediction, structure determination, functional analysis, protein engineering, protein mutagenesis analysis, and protein design.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies. One source of data is the three-dimensional (3D) structure of biological molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA.

Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses.  Our Specific Aims are as follows:  1. To develop software for automatic text mining and information extraction.  2. To conduct bioinformatic analyses and molecular biological experiments for TC knowledge expansion.  3. To interconnect TCDB bidirectionally with other relevant databases, thereby creating a  ""network"" of knowledge from current ""island"" databases.  4. To use multiple approaches to derive reliable functional predictions as guides for future  research.  5. To utilize a newly formed TCDB advisory board and establish a plan for modernization and  sustainability. These goals are top priorities for rendering TCDB increasingly useful to the scientific community.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TCDB is a database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematized information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport of salts, nutrients, toxins, drugs and macromolecules. It is the only IUBMB approved system for classifying transport proteins.

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1        The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.

"Improving Modeling by Learning from Details of High Accuracy Protein Structures     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The functions of proteins depend exquisitely on their structure, with details at the 0.1 ¿ scale influencing enzyme catalysis, disease-causing mutations, and drug recognition. For this reason, having detailed and accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and the NIH funded the Protein Structure Initiative with the goal of obtaining models for every protein structure with an accuracy approaching that of a high-resolution crystal structure. Current technology for template-based modeling is powerful, but cannot yet deliver ""near-crystal-structure"" quality. Tests show that the best minimization routines still fall short of consistently producing protein models for close homologs that approach within ~1 ¿ rmsd of the 'native' structure as ultimately revealed by crystal structures. To help break through this 1 ¿ barrier, during the previous period of support we used ultrahigh-resolution structures to create a library of conformation- dependent ideal geometry functions for the protein backbone, and showed that its use improves the quality of protein crystal structures and holds promise to improve template-based model refinement. We also discovered that ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures are a rich source of details about protein structure that are not accurately attainable from structures in the ~1.5-2 ¿ resolution range and thus have not yet been fully accounted for in current energy functions. Here, our central hypothesis is that a major step forward in template-based modeling accuracy will come from identifying and explicitly taking into account detailed features of protein covalent geometry, conformation and non-covalent packing interactions that have not yet been characterized, and can now be gleaned from the study of highly accurate ultrahigh-resolution protein structures. The overall goal of our proposal is to mine such information so it can be used to improve the accuracy of predictive modeling. With many ultrahigh-resolution structures now available, the time is ripe to achieve this goal by pursuing three specific aims related to (1) extending the impact of the 'ideal geometry function' paradigm by creating, optimizing, and implementing conformation- dependent libraries accounting for peptide planarity, side chains, and cis-peptides, (2) mining ultrahigh- resolution crystal structures to glean information for next-generation empirical energy functions, and (3) analyzing ultrahigh-resolution protein structures solved in varying environments to produce a set of benchmark test cases and developing residue level assessment tools to use with these test cases to evaluate and hone template-based modeling refinement applications. This proposed work is low cost and low risk, and has a high likelihood of substantial impact as it provides basic information that can be widely incorporated into predictive and experimental modeling applications to improve their accuracy. It is also distinct from major efforts being invested into template-based modeling. Introducing this greater level of realism is a prerequisite to improving the refinement step of template-based modeling and achieving the goals of the Protein Structure Initiative.           Proteins carry out the work that gets done inside of cells, so figuring out what they look like helps us understand things like how drugs work and how to design new drugs that will work even better. It is not practical to experimentally determine every protein structure, so having reliable ways to use computers to predict their structures is quite important. Current methods are not quite accurate enough, and the goal of this work is to look carefully at the best known protein structures to learn from their exact features how we can improve prediction technology to get the details right.

"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The cellular network and its environment govern cell and organism behavior and are fundamental to the comprehension of function, misfunction and drug discovery. Over the last few years, drugs were observed to often bind to more than one target; thus, poly-pharmacology approaches can be advantageous, complementing the ""one drug - one target"" strategy. Targeting drug discovery from the systems biology standpoint can help in studies of network effects of mono- and poly-pharmacology. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the usefulness of network description and tools for mono- and poly-pharmacology, and the ways through which protein interactions can help single- and multi-target drug discovery efforts. We further describe how, when combined with experimental data, modeled structural networks which can predict which proteins interact and provide the structures of their interfaces, can model the cellular pathways, and suggest which specific pathways are likely to be affected. Such structural networks may facilitate structure-based drug design; forecast side effects of drugs; and suggest how the effects of drug binding can propagate in multi-molecular complexes and pathways. Cellular functions are performed through protein-protein interactions; therefore, identification of these interactions is crucial for understanding biological processes. Recent studies suggest that knowledge-based approaches are more useful than ""blind"" docking for modeling at large scales. However, a caveat of knowledge-based approaches is that they treat molecules as rigid structures. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) offers a wealth of conformations. Here, we exploited an ensemble of the conformations in predictions by a knowledge-based method, PRISM. We tested ""difficult"" cases in a docking-benchmark data set, where the unbound and bound protein forms are structurally different. Considering alternative conformations for each protein, the percentage of successfully predicted interactions increased from about 26 to 66%, and 57% of the interactions were successfully predicted in an ""unbiased"" scenario, in which data related to the bound forms were not utilized. If the appropriate conformation, or relevant template interface, is unavailable in the PDB, PRISM could not predict the interaction successfully. The pace of the growth of the PDB promises a rapid increase of ensemble conformations emphasizing the merit of such knowledge-based ensemble strategies for higher success rates in protein-protein interaction predictions on an interactome scale. We constructed the structural network of ERK interacting proteins as a case study. We constructed and simulated a ""minimal proteome"" model using Langevin dynamics. It contains 206 essential protein types that were compiled from the literature. For comparison, we generated six proteomes with randomized concentrations. We found that the net charges and molecular weights of the proteins in the minimal genome are not random. The net charge of a protein decreases linearly with molecular weight, with small proteins being mostly positively charged and large proteins negatively charged. The protein copy numbers in the minimal genome have the tendency to maximize the number of protein-protein interactions in the network. Negatively charged proteins that tend to have larger sizes can provide a large collision cross-section allowing them to interact with other proteins; on the other hand, the smaller positively charged proteins could have higher diffusion speed and are more likely to collide with other proteins. Proteomes with random charge/mass populations form less stable clusters than those with experimental protein copy numbers. Our study suggests that ""proper"" populations of negatively and positively charged proteins are important for maintaining a protein-protein interaction network in a proteome. It is interesting to note that the minimal genome model based on the charge and mass of Escherichia coli may have alarger protein-protein interaction network than that based on the lower organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Proteins function through their interactions, and the availability of protein interaction networks could help in understanding cellular processes. However, the known structural data are limited and the classical network node-and-edge representation, where proteins are nodes and interactions are edges, shows only which proteins interact; not how they interact. Structural networks provide this information. Protein-protein interface structures can also indicate which binding partners can interact simultaneously and which are competitive, and can help forecasting potentially harmful drug side effects. Here, we use a powerful protein-protein interactions prediction tool which is able to carry out accurate predictions on the proteome scale to construct the structural network of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This knowledge-based method, PRISM, is motif-based, and is combined with flexible refinement and energy scoring. PRISM predicts protein interactions based on structural and evolutionary similarity to known protein interfaces. n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,8763103,ZIABC010442,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'CCR', 'Case Study', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Lower Organism', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Modeling', 'Modeling of Cellular Pathways', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mono-S', 'Movement', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'biological research', 'blind', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'globular protein', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'method development', 'molecular dynamics', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'success', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2013,98903,0.1381670233473377
"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.        G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.

The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins. Human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.            ",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8437358,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Fungal Genome', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,290550,0.13301939485205844
"Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of protein structure from the amino acid sequence is one of the most important and challenging problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. With the exponential growth of protein sequences without solved protein structures in the post-genomic era, accurate protein structure prediction methods and tools are in urgent need. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach to advance protein structure prediction at the 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) levels. At the 1D level, novel information such as domain evolution signals, alternative gene splicing sites, and 2D protein contact map will be used to predict protein domain boundaries from the sequences. At the 2D level, new methods such as residue contact propagation, machine learning boosting, linear programming, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations will be used to advance residue-residue contact prediction for a domain, or a protein. At the 3D level, 2D contact prediction, fold recognition via machine learning, and multi-template combination will be used to enhance both template-based and ab initio structure prediction. Finally, knowledge-based statistical machine learning methods and model combination algorithms will be developed to reliably evaluate and refine the quality of predicted protein structural models. One of several innovative aspects of this approach is to integrate 1D, 2D, and 3D predictions in order to improve each other through protein structural unit - domains. The 1D, 2D, and 3D protein structure prediction methods will be implemented as user-friendly software packages and web services released to the scientific community. These tools and web services will be useful for protein structure prediction, structure determination, functional analysis, protein engineering, protein mutagenesis analysis, and protein design.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The project will develop accurate computational methods and tools for basic biomedical research such as protein structure prediction, protein function analysis, protein design, protein engineering, and structure-based drug design.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies. One source of data is the three-dimensional (3D) structure of biological molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses.  Our Specific Aims are as follows:  1. To develop software for automatic text mining and information extraction.  2. To conduct bioinformatic analyses and molecular biological experiments for TC knowledge expansion.  3. To interconnect TCDB bidirectionally with other relevant databases, thereby creating a  ""network"" of knowledge from current ""island"" databases.  4. To use multiple approaches to derive reliable functional predictions as guides for future  research.  5. To utilize a newly formed TCDB advisory board and establish a plan for modernization and  sustainability. These goals are top priorities for rendering TCDB increasingly useful to the scientific community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TCDB is a database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematized information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport of salts, nutrients, toxins, drugs and macromolecules. It is the only IUBMB approved system for classifying transport proteins. Funding of this proposal will allow the maintenance and further development of TCDB, interlinking with related databases, expansion of machine learning approaches for information acquisition, and introduction of approaches for predicting the functions of uncharacterized proteins.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins.

This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity.

The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally.

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors).

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health.

"Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tremendous progress has been made in computational protein design in the last 10 years. Though most work has focused on redesign of existing proteins to enhance their stability, specificity or new functionality, successful designs of novel protein folds (not naturally occurring) have emerged. However, to make protein design useful in practical applications, many challenges still exist in the design of protein-protein and protein- DNA interface and the design of dynamic properties of proteins, etc. To conquer those challenges, a practical solution is to develop more accurate scoring functions. It has been proved both experimentally and theoretically that intra and intermolecular signaling between distant sites within one or among many proteins plays a significant role in many biological processes, such as signal transmission and allosteric regulation, etc. The main research goal of this R21 grant is to develop new algorithms and strategies to incorporate the site-site couplings into a protein design procedure. Specifically, in Aim 1, we propose to study the site-site couplings and cooperative interactions of a protein or protein system using both the sequence-based and the physics-based approaches. Critical assessment of the existing approaches will be conducted and a novel algorithm will be developed using the residue-residue interaction energies. In Aim 2, the best methods for site-site couplings prediction will be tailored and integrated to physical scoring functions of protein design. To guarantee the success of this research grant, we propose four schemes to incorporate/combine the site-site coupling into a protein design procedure. The first two schemes represent simple combinations of sequence-based and physics-based protein design approaches; on the other hand, the next two schemes represent a more advanced integration of site-site correlations and physical scoring functions. In the last protocol, we propose to develop a novel scheme and software package to conduct protein design using the residue-residue interaction energies as a template. This approach, which is referred to as correlation embedding (CE), is based on a hypothesis that the correlation information is intrinsically encoded in the interaction energy matrix. The success of this sub-aim will have a great impact on rational protein design, as it represents a perfect integration of site-site couplings into a physical scoring function and opens a new avenue to conduct protein design. All the designed promising PDZ proteins will be synthesized and tested in both folding and functional assays.        Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings In this proposal, we intend to develop novel approaches to conquer the challenges in protein design. The new protein design strategies can facilitate us to engineer dynamical controls into a novel protein so that it can undertake a dynamic function. The novel approaches could be used to develop more effective biomedicine.

"Dissecting the roles of superchaperones in type III secretion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous Gram-negative bacteria including many NIAID Biodefense priority pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to deliver tens of proteins into host cells. While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2). Insights gained from these studies will likely result in generating new directions for the development of novel agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with Gram-negative bacterial infections.        Many bacterial pathogens utilized a specialized secretion system to deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells. Our proposal is aimed at understanding the common strategies the bacteria use to recognize and deliver the secreted proteins to these specialized secretion systems. The results from our studies are likely to be valuable in the development of novel antimicrobials to treat common infections caused by these organisms.

"Improving Modeling by Learning from Details of High Accuracy Protein Structures     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The functions of proteins depend exquisitely on their structure, with details at the 0.1 ¿ scale influencing enzyme catalysis, disease-causing mutations, and drug recognition. For this reason, having detailed and accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and the NIH funded the Protein Structure Initiative with the goal of obtaining models for every protein structure with an accuracy approaching that of a high-resolution crystal structure. Current technology for template-based modeling is powerful, but cannot yet deliver ""near-crystal-structure"" quality. Tests show that the best minimization routines still fall short of consistently producing protein models for close homologs that approach within ~1 ¿ rmsd of the 'native' structure as ultimately revealed by crystal structures. To help break through this 1 ¿ barrier, during the previous period of support we used ultrahigh-resolution structures to create a library of conformation- dependent ideal geometry functions for the protein backbone, and showed that its use improves the quality of protein crystal structures and holds promise to improve template-based model refinement. We also discovered that ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures are a rich source of details about protein structure that are not accurately attainable from structures in the ~1.5-2 ¿ resolution range and thus have not yet been fully accounted for in current energy functions. Here, our central hypothesis is that a major step forward in template-based modeling accuracy will come from identifying and explicitly taking into account detailed features of protein covalent geometry, conformation and non-covalent packing interactions that have not yet been characterized, and can now be gleaned from the study of highly accurate ultrahigh-resolution protein structures. The overall goal of our proposal is to mine such information so it can be used to improve the accuracy of predictive modeling. With many ultrahigh-resolution structures now available, the time is ripe to achieve this goal by pursuing three specific aims related to (1) extending the impact of the 'ideal geometry function' paradigm by creating, optimizing, and implementing conformation- dependent libraries accounting for peptide planarity, side chains, and cis-peptides, (2) mining ultrahigh- resolution crystal structures to glean information for next-generation empirical energy functions, and (3) analyzing ultrahigh-resolution protein structures solved in varying environments to produce a set of benchmark test cases and developing residue level assessment tools to use with these test cases to evaluate and hone template-based modeling refinement applications. This proposed work is low cost and low risk, and has a high likelihood of substantial impact as it provides basic information that can be widely incorporated into predictive and experimental modeling applications to improve their accuracy. It is also distinct from major efforts being invested into template-based modeling. Introducing this greater level of realism is a prerequisite to improving the refinement step of template-based modeling and achieving the goals of the Protein Structure Initiative.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Proteins carry out the work that gets done inside of cells, so figuring out what they look like helps us understand things like how drugs work and how to design new drugs that will work even better.

"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms Prediction of protein-protein interactions at the structural level on the proteome scale is important because it allows prediction of protein function, helps drug discovery and takes steps toward genome-wide structural systems biology. We provide a protocol (termed PRISM, protein interactions by structural matching) for large-scale prediction of protein-protein interactions and assembly of protein complex structures. The method consists of two components, rigid-body structural comparisons of target proteins to known template protein-protein interfaces and flexible refinement using a docking energy function. The PRISM rationale follows our observation that globally different protein structures can interact via similar architectural motifs. PRISM predicts binding residues by using structural similarity and evolutionary conservation of putative binding residue hot spots. Ultimately, PRISM could help to construct cellular pathways and functional, proteome-scale annotation. PRISM is implemented in Python and runs in a UNIX environment. The program accepts Protein Data Bank-formatted protein structures.The similarity between folding and binding led us to posit the concept that the number of protein-protein interface motifs in nature is limited, and interacting protein pairs can use similar interface architectures repeatedly, even if their global folds completely vary. Thus, known protein-protein interface architectures can be used to model the complexes between two target proteins on the proteome scale, even if their global structures differ. This powerful concept is combined with a flexible refinement and global energy assessment tool. The accuracy of the method is highly dependent on the structural diversity of the interface architectures in the template dataset. Here, we validate this knowledge-based combinatorial method on the Docking Benchmark and show that it efficiently finds high-quality models for benchmark complexes and their binding regions even in the absence of template interfaces having sequence similarity to the targets. Compared to classical docking, it is computationally faster; as the number of target proteins increases, the difference becomes more dramatic. Further, it is able to distinguish binders from nonbinders. These features allow performing large-scale network modeling. The results on an independent target set (proteins in the p53 molecular interaction map) show that current method can be used to predict whether a given protein pair interacts. Overall, while constrained by the diversity of the template set, this approach efficiently produces high-quality models of protein-protein complexes. We expect that with the growing number of known interface architectures, this type of knowledge-based methods will be increasingly used by the broad proteomics community.Networks are increasingly used to study the impact of drugs at the systems level. From the algorithmic standpoint, a drug can attack nodes or edges of a protein-protein interaction network. In this work, we propose a new network strategy, The Interface Attack, based on protein-protein interfaces. Similar interface architectures can occur between unrelated proteins. Consequently, in principle, a drug that binds to one has a certain probability of binding others. The interface attack strategy simultaneously removes from the network all interactions that consist of similar interface motifs. This strategy is inspired by network pharmacology and allows inferring potential off-targets. We introduce a network model which we call Protein Interface and Interaction Network (P2IN), which is the integration of protein-protein interface structures and protein interaction networks. This interface-based network organization clarifies which protein pairs have structurally similar interfaces, and which proteins may compete to bind the same surface region. We built the P2IN of p53 signaling network and performed network robustness analysis. We show that (1) hitting frequent interfaces (a set of edges distributed around the network) might be as destructive as eleminating high degree proteins (hub nodes), (2) frequent interfaces are not always topologically critical elements in the network, and (3) interface attack may reveal functional changes in the system better than attack of single proteins. In the off-target detection case study, we found that drugs blocking the interface between CDK6 and CDKN2D may also affect the interaction between CDK4 and CDKN2D.Conformational selection emerges as a theme in macromolecular interactions. Data validate it as a prevailing mechanism in protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-small molecule drug recognition. This raises the question of whether this fundamental biomolecular binding mechanism can be used to improve drug docking and discovery. Actually, in practice this has already been taking place for some years in increasing numbers. Essentially, it argues for using not a single conformer, but an ensemble. The paradigm of conformational selection holds that because the ensemble is heterogeneous, within it there will be states whose conformation matches that of the ligand. Even if the population of this state is low, since it is favorable for binding the ligand, it will bind to it with a subsequent population shift toward this conformer. Here we suggest expanding it by first modeling all protein interactions in the cell by using Prism, an efficient motif-based protein-protein interaction modeling strategy, followed by ensemble generation. Such a strategy could be particularly useful for signaling proteins, which are major targets in drug discovery and bind multiple partners through a shared binding site, each with some-minor or major-conformational change. n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,8552695,ZIABC010442,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'CCR', 'CDK4 gene', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Docking', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hot Spot', 'Indium', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Movement', 'Multiple Partners', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Series', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'conformer', 'data management', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'genome-wide', 'globular protein', 'improved', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'method development', 'molecular dynamics', 'network models', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2012,106284,0.08884347997949302
"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains. Aim 3, we will experimentally validate the predictions in vitro to assess the performance of the computational method. We will also conduct in vivo experiments to examine the biological significance of a set of selected domain-peptide interactions.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.        G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development. We will use multiscale modeling methods to connect their structure and dynamics to function, in order to aid in the design and refinement of novel drugs.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.        The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. The model will be a protein involved in degrading other proteins.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas.

"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction The goal of this project is to develop new algorithms for protein function prediction. Recent rapid advancements in various technological developments produce biological data of unprecedented amount and complexity. Computational methods are becoming essential components in modern biomedical research. One of greatest challenges facing bioinformatician is the discovery of connections among different data sets and generating novel biological knowledge or hypotheses. Predicting the molecular function of novel proteins is ah urgent task for the post-genomics era. Especially, recent assessment of structural genomic efforts revealed a gap between experimental protein structure determination and the use ofthe structural knowledge for gaining understanding of biological function of the proteins at the molecular level. We will employ recent developments in discriminative machine learning approaches for constructing a residue-level classification system for function prediction from structure. Existing systems for functional prediction from structure either use global structural and sequence similarities over entire protein chain or use localized similarities such as putative functional sites. Our system will leverage the information from both global and local similarities, and identifies important residues and clusters of residues that are distinctive among different functional families. Our approach is based on and extend over an efficient optimization framework that we developed for protein superfamily classification. We expect that these methodological developments will not only improve the performance of state-of-the-art function prediction, but also help illuminating our understanding ofthe interplay of sequence and structure on defining functional variations among protein families. Beyond this major project, we will work on an additional project that extends the graph theoretical models for multiple sequence alignment we developed earlier to meet the challenge of domain annotation for large new sequence set.

"Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of protein structure from the amino acid sequence is one of the most important and challenging problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. With the exponential growth of protein sequences without solved protein structures in the post-genomic era, accurate protein structure prediction methods and tools are in urgent need. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach to advance protein structure prediction at the 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) levels. At the 1D level, novel information such as domain evolution signals, alternative gene splicing sites, and 2D protein contact map will be used to predict protein domain boundaries from the sequences. At the 2D level, new methods such as residue contact propagation, machine learning boosting, linear programming, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations will be used to advance residue-residue contact prediction for a domain, or a protein. At the 3D level, 2D contact prediction, fold recognition via machine learning, and multi-template combination will be used to enhance both template-based and ab initio structure prediction. Finally, knowledge-based statistical machine learning methods and model combination algorithms will be developed to reliably evaluate and refine the quality of predicted protein structural models. One of several innovative aspects of this approach is to integrate 1D, 2D, and 3D predictions in order to improve each other through protein structural unit - domains. The 1D, 2D, and 3D protein structure prediction methods will be implemented as user-friendly software packages and web services released to the scientific community.

"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,8111224,R01GM076706,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Space Explorations', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2011,227860,0.10672789050011312
"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies.

The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+ binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high- throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, and individual transporter.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to broaden and deepen our efforts to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, design new machine learning approaches for data, and introduce procedures for making functional predictions of uncharacterized transporters. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses.  Our Specific Aims are as follows:  1. To develop software for automatic text mining and information extraction.  2. To conduct bioinformatic analyses and molecular biological experiments for TC knowledge expansion.  3. To interconnect TCDB bidirectionally with other relevant databases, thereby creating a  ""network"" of knowledge from current ""island"" databases.  4. To use multiple approaches to derive reliable functional predictions as guides for future  research.  5. To utilize a newly formed TCDB advisory board and establish a plan for modernization and  sustainability. These goals are top priorities for rendering TCDB increasingly useful to the scientific community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TCDB is a database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematized information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport of salts, nutrients, toxins, drugs and macromolecules. It is the only IUBMB approved system for classifying transport proteins.

"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research. This work is aimed at leading to a universal improvement in the accuracy with which protein structure can be built.           n/a",Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins,8111114,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Homology Modeling', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular mechanics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,208186,0.14151534128502943
"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation.

"Building and Validating Location Proteomics Databases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this proposal is to collect high-resolution information on the distribution of proteins within mammalian cells and to link it to nucleotide and protein sequences. It builds on extensive prior work on development of protein tagging methods by the co-PIs and on development of software systems for automated analysis of subcellular patterns in fluorescence microscope images by the PI. 25,000 independent cell lines expressing GFP protein fusions will be created in NIH 3T3 cells using high-throughput CD-tagging (protein-trapping) methods. As the cell lines are created, high-resolution fluorescence microscope images will be collected using fluorescence microscopy and the gene and protein tagged in each cell line will be determined by high-throughput molecular analysis methods. The images will be subjected to automated, computerized image analysis to group proteins with statistically indistinguishable patterns. The determined location for each protein will be compared to whatever information is available from protein databases, journal articles and location predictors. Each assigned location will be accompanied by a confidence estimate derived from combining these sources. In addition, the images for each protein group will be used to build generative models that can synthesize new protein distributions statistically equivalent to the original images.

"Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tremendous progress has been made in computational protein design in the last 10 years. Though most work has focused on redesign of existing proteins to enhance their stability, specificity or new functionality, successful designs of novel protein folds (not naturally occurring) have emerged. However, to make protein design useful in practical applications, many challenges still exist in the design of protein-protein and protein- DNA interface and the design of dynamic properties of proteins, etc. To conquer those challenges, a practical solution is to develop more accurate scoring functions. It has been proved both experimentally and theoretically that intra and intermolecular signaling between distant sites within one or among many proteins plays a significant role in many biological processes, such as signal transmission and allosteric regulation, etc. The main research goal of this R21 grant is to develop new algorithms and strategies to incorporate the site-site couplings into a protein design procedure. Specifically, in Aim 1, we propose to study the site-site couplings and cooperative interactions of a protein or protein system using both the sequence-based and the physics-based approaches. Critical assessment of the existing approaches will be conducted and a novel algorithm will be developed using the residue-residue interaction energies. In Aim 2, the best methods for site-site couplings prediction will be tailored and integrated to physical scoring functions of protein design. To guarantee the success of this research grant, we propose four schemes to incorporate/combine the site-site coupling into a protein design procedure. The first two schemes represent simple combinations of sequence-based and physics-based protein design approaches; on the other hand, the next two schemes represent a more advanced integration of site-site correlations and physical scoring functions. In the last protocol, we propose to develop a novel scheme and software package to conduct protein design using the residue-residue interaction energies as a template. This approach, which is referred to as correlation embedding (CE), is based on a hypothesis that the correlation information is intrinsically encoded in the interaction energy matrix. The success of this sub-aim will have a great impact on rational protein design, as it represents a perfect integration of site-site couplings into a physical scoring function and opens a new avenue to conduct protein design. All the designed promising PDZ proteins will be synthesized and tested in both folding and functional assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein Design Using Physical Scoring Functions integrated with Site Couplings In this proposal, we intend to develop novel approaches to conquer the challenges in protein design.

"Dissecting the roles of superchaperones in type III secretion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous Gram-negative bacteria including many NIAID Biodefense priority pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to deliver tens of proteins into host cells. While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2). Insights gained from these studies will likely result in generating new directions for the development of novel agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with Gram-negative bacterial infections.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many bacterial pathogens utilized a specialized secretion system to deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells.

"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms Several methods have been developed to address (i) protein docking; (ii) helical symmetry description and (iii) protein folding using docking techniques.  (i) Symmetric protein complexes are abundant in the living cell. Predicting their atomic structure can shed light on the mechanism of many important biological processes. Symmetric docking methods aim to predict the structure of these complexes given the unbound structure of a single monomer, or its model. Symmetry constraints reduce the search-space of these methods and make the prediction easier compared to asymmetric protein-protein docking. However, the challenge of modeling the conformational changes that the monomer might undergo is a major obstacle. In this article, we present SymmRef, a novel method for refinement and reranking of symmetric docking solutions. The method models backbone and side-chain movements and optimizes the rigid-body orientations of the monomers. The backbone movements are modeled by normal modes minimization and the conformations of the side-chains are modeled by selecting optimal rotamers. Since solved structures of symmetric multimers show asymmetric side-chain conformations, we do not use symmetry constraints in the side-chain optimization procedure. The refined models are re-ranked according to an energy score. We tested the method on a benchmark of unbound docking challenges. The results show that the method significantly improves the accuracy and the ranking of symmetric rigid docking solutions. (ii) Assemblies with helical symmetry can be conveniently formulated in many distinct ways. Here, a new convention is presented which unifies the two most commonly used helical systems for generating helical assemblies from asymmetric units determined by X-ray fibre diffraction and EM imaging. A helical assembly is viewed as being composed of identical repetitive units in a one- or two-dimensional lattice, named 1-D and 2-D helical systems, respectively. The unification suggests that a new helical description with only four parameters [n(1), n(2), twist, rise], which is called the augmented 1-D helical system, can generate the complete set of helical arrangements, including coverage of helical discontinuities (seams). A unified four-parameter characterization implies similar parameters for similar assemblies, can eliminate errors in reproducing structures of helical assemblies and facilitates the generation of polymorphic ensembles from helical atomic models or EM density maps. Further, guidelines are provided for such a unique description that reflects the structural signature of an assembly, as well as rules for manipulating the helical symmetry presentation. (iii) The pathways by which proteins fold into their specific native structure are still an unsolved mystery. Currently, many methods for protein structure prediction are available, and most of them tackle the problem by relying on the vast amounts of data collected from known protein structures. These methods are often not concerned with the route the protein follows to reach its final fold. This work is based on the premise that proteins fold in a hierarchical manner. We present FOBIA, an automated method for predicting a protein structure. FOBIA consists of two main stages: the first finds matches between parts of the target sequence and independently folding structural units using profile-profile comparison. The second assembles these units into a 3D structure by searching and ranking their possible orientations toward each other using a docking-based approach. We have previously reported an application of an initial version of this strategy to homology based targets. Since then we have considerably enhanced our method's abilities to allow it to address the more difficult template-based target category. This allows us to now apply FOBIA to the template-based targets of CASP8 and to show that it is both very efficient and promising. Our method can provide an alternative for template-based structure prediction, and in particular, the docking-basedranking technique presented here can be incorporated into any profile-profile comparison based method. n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,8349006,ZIABC010442,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'CASP8 gene', 'CCR', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Docking', 'Fiber', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phage Display', 'Procedures', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Series', 'Side', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'density', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'globular protein', 'improved', 'instrument', 'method development', 'molecular dynamics', 'monomer', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'tau Proteins', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web site']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2011,128512,0.11719231911589519
"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains. Aim 3, we will experimentally validate the predictions in vitro to assess the performance of the computational method. We will also conduct in vivo experiments to examine the biological significance of a set of selected domain-peptide interactions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-protein interactions play critical roles in the cell and mutations that disrupt these interactions result in many diseases.

"Database and Prediction Algorithm for the Leucine-rich Nuclear Export Signals    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appropriate cellular localization plays a key role in regulating protein functions. Active traffic of macromolecules across the nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated primarily by members of the Karyopherin 2 family (Kap2), which bind their transport substrates through distinct nuclear localization or export signals (NLSs or NESs). The long term objectives of the applicant are to understand the recognition mechanisms and functional programs for each Kap2 pathway. This project focuses on the most prominent export- Kap2 CRM1. CRM1 is the nuclear export receptor for hundreds of macromolecules with diverse functions, and hence is an important regulator of many cellular processes. This proposal describes a computational/bioinformatics project to compile an up-to-date LR-NES database and develop a structure- and sequence-based LR-NES prediction program. The first goal of this project is to compile a LR-NES database that will include most of the experimentally validated natural and synthetic LR-NES containing proteins published in the literature. The information will be stored in a MySQL database and be made available through the Internet. Each entry will include the detailed information for the protein regarding its export properties, such as the functional export signal, critical residues required for export, determined or predicted secondary structure of the export signal, etc. The second goal of this project is to develop a structure- and sequence-based LR-NES prediction algorithm. The consensus sequence of LR-NESs is diverse, vague, and prevalent. As a result, the only available predictor of LR-NES, which is based on sequence alone, is only marginally useful. This project seeks to use the structural requirements obtained from the newly available crystal structure of CRM1 bound to a LR-NES- containing cargo to filter the LR-NES sequence patterns and thereby greatly increase the prediction accuracy. The project will provide insights into how different NESs interacts with CRM1 and aid in the development of future therapeutics (inhibitors and gene targeting agents) targeted at the CRM1 export pathway to control various disease states including cancer and viral replications.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a bioinformatics project to compile a database and a prediction program for the leucine-rich nuclear export signals recognized by CRM1, which is a nuclear export receptor for hundreds of proteins with diverse functions.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of the proposed research to public health lies in part in the insights, and accompanying methods, that will be provided about structure/function relationships in proteins. Specific applications to B-cell Biology have direct relevance to understanding a variety of B-cell related cancers.            The relevance of the proposed research to public health lies in part in the insights, and accompanying methods, that will be provided about structure/function relationships in proteins.

"Multiscale modeling of G protein-coupled receptors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family in the mammalian genome, and are critical to a number of cell signaling processes. As a result, they are of enormous biomedical importance; by some estimates, as many as 50% of new pharmaceuticals target GPCRs. Unsurprisingly, there has been a huge research investment in understanding their biophysics. However, integral membrane proteins are challenging to work with experimentally, leaving an opportunity for computational methods to make a significant contribution. We will use multiscale modeling techniques, including all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network models, to explore the behavior of several GPCRs, including rhodopsin (and its retinal-free form, opsin) and the ¿2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Specifically, we will investigate the role of ligand binding in modulating GPCR function, via two separate all-atom molecular dynamics calculations. Microsecond-scale simulations of opsin will, when contrasted with our previous work on rhodopsin in the dark state and during the early stages of activation, allow us to see which interactions in rhodopsin are determined by the presence of the ligand, while the planned simulations of the full activation process will give the first atomic-level view of the structural changes involved in GPCR activation; this knowledge could be critical to the design of novel inhibitors to other GPCRs. The second goal of this proposal is to clarify the role of internal waters in the activation mechanism of GPCRs; our previous simulations described significant increases in the internal hydration of rhodopsin and B2AR. Here, we propose to pursue those observations more rigorously, using automatic pattern recognition methods to correlate hydration changes with functionally interesting protein motions in simulations of rhodopsin, B2AR, and the cannabinoid-2 receptor (CB2). The third goal of the proposal is to develop elastic network models - a simple, computationally inexpensive approach where the protein's interactions are represented as a network of springs - in order to explore larger scale problems not readily amenable to all-atom molecular dynamics, like the modulation of protein motions by G protein binding and GPCR oligomerization. A number of possible network model implementations will be considered, and the models will be carefully validated by quantitative comparison to extensive molecular dynamics simulations, including those proposed for the first aim. The fourth and final goal of the proposal is to assess the validity of a common assumption, that rhodopsin is a good template for understanding GPCR activation in general. To test this hypothesis we will apply multiple computational methods, including long timescale molecular dynamics and elastic network models, to a series of GPCRs, including rhodopsin, opsin, B2AR, and CB2. We will quantitatively correlate the fluctuations of the different GPCRs, with the hypothesis that motions conserved across multiple GPCRs are likely to be functionally significant.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: G protein-coupled receptors are the largest family of proteins in the human genome, and are the most targeted proteins for therapeutics development.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways. These aims will be pursued in collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Computing Simbios at Stanford U.",Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems,8017445,R01GM086238,"['Algorithms', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cell physiology', 'Cereals', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Degradation Pathway', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Nature', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chaperonin', 'computer framework', 'data modeling', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'network models', 'novel', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'research study', 'simulation', 'structural genomics', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2011,328558,0.08829120168883386
"Analysis of force developed by a AAA ATPase    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport. This project will focus on studying the activity of these machines at the single molecule level. The model protein will be ClpX - it is the part of the proteosome, a key effect of protein degradation that unfolds the proteins to prepare them for degradation. . Cellular proteins differ widely in their liability, from half-lives of minutes to days. Regulated degradation, by allowing rapid changes in the levels of cellular proteins, helps control signal transduction pathways, the cell- cycle, transcription, apoptosis, antigen processing, biological clock control, differentiation and surface receptor desensitization. The questions to be addressed are: How is work partitioned between alternative outcomes? What is the maximum work that can be performed by the system? What factors limit its efficiency in performing work? These questions have health implications: human pathological conditions are associated with failures of the degradation system and its regulation offers the potential for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, an inhibitor of proteasome catalytic activity is in use for treatment of recurrent multiple myeloma, and proteasome inhibitors are in clinical trial for treatment of a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Thus, understanding the regulation of the half-life of proteins should provide critical insights into cell physiology and pathology. The mishandling of aberrant proteins incurs penalties throughout biology: the survival of bacteria subjected to stress depends on the effective performance of systems which deal with misfolded and structurally aberrant proteins- to either fold them properly or destroy them. The specific questions to be addressed are: How hard can the device pull to cause unfolding? How many pulls are needed to commit irreversibly? What is the limit of pulling power, and the statistical distribution of pulling power? Answers to these questions will begin to reveal not just what these machines do but the decision tree that describes how outcomes are controlled and when machine capacity may be exceeded. We want to know not just how the machine works, but how its decision tree yields alternative outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The AAA ATPases family includes molecules whose roles include, but are far from limited to, biogenesis of mitochondria and multivesicular bodies, proteins in involved in gene regulation and protein transport.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,8019584,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2011,98010,0.061882703959029346
"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction The goal of this project is to develop new algorithms for protein function prediction. Recent rapid advancements in various technological developments produce biological data of unprecedented amount and complexity. Computational methods are becoming essential components in modern biomedical research. One of greatest challenges facing bioinformatician is the discovery of connections among different data sets and generating novel biological knowledge or hypotheses. Predicting the molecular function of novel proteins is ah urgent task for the post-genomics era. Especially, recent assessment of structural genomic efforts revealed a gap between experimental protein structure determination and the use ofthe structural knowledge for gaining understanding of biological function of the proteins at the molecular level. We will employ recent developments in discriminative machine learning approaches for constructing a residue-level classification system for function prediction from structure. Existing systems for functional prediction from structure either use global structural and sequence similarities over entire protein chain or use localized similarities such as putative functional sites. Our system will leverage the information from both global and local similarities, and identifies important residues and clusters of residues that are distinctive among different functional families. Our approach is based on and extend over an efficient optimization framework that we developed for protein superfamily classification. We expect that these methodological developments will not only improve the performance of state-of-the-art function prediction, but also help illuminating our understanding ofthe interplay of sequence and structure on defining functional variations among protein families. Beyond this major project, we will work on an additional project that extends the graph theoretical models for multiple sequence alignment we developed earlier to meet the challenge of domain annotation for large new sequence set. The advancement of medical research is partly based on our detailed understanding ofthe functions of  genes and proteins.

"Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of protein structure from the amino acid sequence is one of the most important and challenging problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. With the exponential growth of protein sequences without solved protein structures in the post-genomic era, accurate protein structure prediction methods and tools are in urgent need. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach to advance protein structure prediction at the 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) levels. At the 1D level, novel information such as domain evolution signals, alternative gene splicing sites, and 2D protein contact map will be used to predict protein domain boundaries from the sequences. At the 2D level, new methods such as residue contact propagation, machine learning boosting, linear programming, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations will be used to advance residue-residue contact prediction for a domain, or a protein. At the 3D level, 2D contact prediction, fold recognition via machine learning, and multi-template combination will be used to enhance both template-based and ab initio structure prediction. Finally, knowledge-based statistical machine learning methods and model combination algorithms will be developed to reliably evaluate and refine the quality of predicted protein structural models. One of several innovative aspects of this approach is to integrate 1D, 2D, and 3D predictions in order to improve each other through protein structural unit - domains. The 1D, 2D, and 3D protein structure prediction methods will be implemented as user-friendly software packages and web services released to the scientific community. These tools and web services will be useful for protein structure prediction, structure determination, functional analysis, protein engineering, protein mutagenesis analysis, and protein design.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The project will develop accurate computational methods and tools for basic biomedical research such as protein structure prediction, protein function analysis, protein design, protein engineering, and structure-based drug design.           PI: Jianlin Cheng Project Narrative The project will develop accurate computational methods and tools for basic biomedical research such as protein structure prediction, protein function analysis, protein design, protein engineering, and structure-based drug design.","Integrated Prediction of Protein Struture at 1D, 2D and 3D Levels",7863766,R01GM093123,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Generations', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Internet', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Production', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spliced Genes', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'base', 'design', 'disulfide bond', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'spatial relationship', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2010,293715,0.18340022807705905
"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7842572,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2010,327180,0.12772424308238137
"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+ binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high- throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research. This work is aimed at leading to a universal improvement in the accuracy with which protein structure can be built.           n/a",Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins,7905142,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Homology Modeling', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular mechanics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,210764,0.14151534128502943
"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7825413,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'therapeutic development', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS,R01,2010,273781,0.06148631873904849
"Computational Methods for Directed Functional Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of gene function (or phenotype) can reduce the scale of an experimental problem by focusing attention on a subset of possible experiments. Current function annotation databases-e.g., the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) annotation of genes with Gene Ontology (GO) functions-are critically important resources, but were not designed to host computational predictions Although SGD and several other annotation databases label predictions as such, they provide no measures of confidence. The need exists for quantitative predictions, as distinct from qualitative ""somebody said so"" predictions. Probabilistic scoring systems, in which the score communicates the probability of veracity, are likely to be the most useful.  We will generate probabilistic predictions by developing probabilistic models for predicting function and phenotype. For reasons of data availability, we use S. cerevisiae and C. elegans as model systems.  We will also generate probabilistic models to predict protein and genetic interactions. We will exploit probabilistic networks of protein and genetic interaction in several ways. We will apply ideas from communication theory (2-terminal network reliability) to predict new members of protein complexes from probabilistic protein networks. We will develop computational methods to guide efficient discovery of genetic interactions in S. cerevisiae, as a model for guiding future high-throughput studies in metazoans. We will exploit probabilistic synthetic lethal interaction networks to identify drug mechanism of action.  We will disseminate predictions to the broader biomedical community. We propose a distributed quantitative prediction resource inspired by the DAS system of distributed genome annotation. We will adapt previously developed interfaces for browsing, searching, and retrieving probabilistic annotations to enhance their utility.  In Aim 1. we develop, apply, and validate methods for predicting function, phenotype, physical and genetic interaction in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans.  In Aim 2. we exploit probabilistic networks of protein and genetic interaction in S. cerevisiae to elucidate network structure, to guide functional genomic experiments, and to reveal drug mechanism of action.

"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms Upon binding, proteins undergo conformational changes. These changes often prevent rigid-body docking methods from predicting the 3D structure of a complex from the unbound conformations of its proteins. Handling protein backbone flexibility is a major challenge for docking methodologies, as backbone flexibility adds a huge number of degrees of freedom to the search space, and therefore considerably increases the running time of docking algorithms. Normal mode analysis permits description of protein flexibility as a linear combination of discrete movements (modes). Low-frequency modes usually describe the large-scale conformational changes of the protein. Therefore, many docking methods model backbone flexibility by using only few modes, which have the lowest frequencies. However, studies show that due to molecular interactions, many proteins also undergo local and small-scale conformational changes, which are described by high-frequency normal modes. We presented a new method, FiberDock, for docking refinement which models backbone flexibility by an unlimited number of normal modes. The method iteratively minimizes the structure of the flexible protein along the most relevant modes. The relevance of a mode is calculated according to the correlation between the chemical forces, applied on each atom, and the translation vector of each atom, according to the normal mode. The results show that the method successfully models backbone movements that occur during molecular interactions and considerably improves the accuracy and the ranking of rigid-docking models of protein-protein complexes. Virtual screening is emerging as a productive and cost-effective technology in rational drug design for the identification of novel lead compounds. An important model for virtual screening is the pharmacophore. Pharmacophore is the spatial configuration of essential features that enable a ligand molecule to interact with a specific target receptor. In the absence of a known receptor structure, a pharmacophore can be identified from a set of ligands that have been observed to interact with the target receptor. We presented a novel computational method for pharmacophore detection and virtual screening. The pharmacophore detection module is able to (i) align multiple flexible ligands in a deterministic manner without exhaustive enumeration of the conformational space, (ii) detect subsets of input ligands that may bind to different binding sites or have different binding modes, (iii) address cases where the input ligands have different affinities by defining weighted pharmacophores based on the number of ligands that share them, and (iv) automatically select the most appropriate pharmacophore candidates for virtual screening. The algorithm is highly efficient, allowing a fast exploration of the chemical space by virtual screening of huge compound databases. The performance of PharmaGist was successfully evaluated on a commonly used data set of G-Protein Coupled Receptor alpha1A. Additionally, a large-scale evaluation using the DUD (directory of useful decoys) data set was performed. DUD contains 2950 active ligands for 40 different receptors, with 36 decoy compounds for each active ligand. PharmaGist enrichment rates are comparable with other state-of-the-art tools for virtual screening. The unanimous agreement that cellular processes are (largely) governed by interactions between proteins has led to enormous community efforts culminating in overwhelming information relating to these proteins; to the regulation of their interactions, to the way in which they interact and to the function which is determined by these interactions. These data have been organized in databases and servers. However, to make these really useful, it is essential not only to be aware of these, but in particular to have a working knowledge of which tools to use for a given problem; what are the tool advantages and drawbacks; and no less important how to combine these for a particular goal since usually it is not one tool, but some combination of tool-modules that is needed.

"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The traditional view of protein evolution has been that all protein domains are descendents of distinct evolutionary lines, that there are a relatively small number of such lines (about 1000), and that these lines are all of relatively ancient origin. Two new bodies of evidence make that view untenable. First, analysis of sets of fully sequenced genomes shows that most protein families appear to be small, and narrowly distributed in phylogenetic space, apparently implying recent emergence. Second, analysis of the relationship between known protein structures shows that there are many more than a 1000 distinct folds, appearing to imply many more evolutionary lines. The large discrepancy between theory and fact has been clear for some time and a number of explanations have been put forward. But so far there has been no definitive study of alternatives. In this project we will systematically and quantitatively investigate four separate hypotheses, each of which may account for some share of the large number of protein folds and apparently young proteins: that these (1) are the result of generation of new open reading frames or frame shifted older ones; (2) are the outcome of extensive recombination of portions of older proteins; (3) are laterally transferred from unexplored parts of phylogenetic space; (4) are part of larger older families where there has been rapid sequence change, such that not all relatives are found. To investigate these hypotheses we will develop and extend a set of computational methods. These include methods of building protein families; reliably estimating the age of protein families, detecting lateral gene transfer effects; determining to what extent members of families are likely to have been detected with sequence methods; more quantitatively determining whether protein structures are evolutionarily related; searching for remote structure and sequence relationships; and analyzing a range of protein properties as a function of family age. We will also construct a web resource for distributing the results and soliciting extensive community annotation and discussion.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.           Project Narrative Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.",Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution,7933643,R01GM081511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Appearance', 'Bacteriophages', 'Calibration', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Generations', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Virus', 'base', 'combat', 'genome sequencing', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'numb protein', 'prokaryotic kingdom', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'theories']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2010,296842,0.12860159272572907
"Nonparametric Analysis of Reverse-Phase Protein Lysate Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play major roles as biological effectors and diagnostic markers. One level of its complexity is due to the post-translational modifications that cannot be detected at the genome level, which makes it desirable to measure proteins directly. Recently, some new protein microarray technologies have begun to bloom for this purpose. We focus on the reverse-phase protein lysate arrays that allow us to quantify the relative expression levels of a protein in many different cellular samples simultaneously. One advantage of this technology is that it requires a small amount of cells with just one antibody binding. However, it is more challenging to analyze protein lysate arrays than DNA arrays, and at the present time, the applications of protein lysate arrays are still in the exploratory stage with a lack of reliable statistical tools for quantifying the information (including the uncertainty) from protein arrays. We find that it is difficult, if at all possible, to model all the samples with a simple parametric family of response curves. We propose a robust approach to quantify the protein lysate arrays by fitting a monotone nonparametric response curve to all samples on the same array. The proposed method has been shown to fit the data more adaptively, avoiding bias due to parameterization. We aim to incorporate the modern shrinkage ideas in statistics into the nonparametric approach, leading to more stable quantification in time course experiments where the number of replicates is small at each time point. We also propose to use wild-bootstrap for assessing uncertainty of the protein concentration estimates and for assessing the influence of such uncertainties in follow-up analyses. When completed, our research will enable more reliable analysis of protein lysate arrays, and provide feedback to chip makers to improve the design of the protein microarrays, both of which are essential in making lysate arrays a useful tool in biological and medical research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to efficient and effective statistical and computing tools for analyzing protein lysate array data that have wide-ranging applications in biomedical and public health research, as evidenced by the recent discovery of target protein in signal pathway profiling related to prostate cancer. These tools are needed to support better applications of protein lysate array technology in clinical and biomedical research.              Project Narrative Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to efficient and effective statistical and computing tools for analyzing protein lysate array data that have wide-ranging applications in biomedical and public health research, as evidenced by the recent discovery of target protein in signal pathway profiling related to prostate cancer.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains. Aim 3, we will experimentally validate the predictions in vitro to assess the performance of the computational method. We will also conduct in vivo experiments to examine the biological significance of a set of selected domain-peptide interactions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-protein interactions play critical roles in the cell and mutations that disrupt these interactions result in many diseases.

"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences. In so doing, this work addresses a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in ""post-genomic biology"": linking massive and exponentially growing amounts of raw sequence and structure data to the molecular basis of biological function.           n/a",Comparative genomics of protein structure and function,7786185,R01GM079656,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PAWR protein', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Solvents', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'computer studies', 'conformer', 'database structure', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2010,278531,0.1129649199482034
"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Sequencing of the human genome is complete, but figuring out where genes are located, how they function, and how they cause or prevent human diseases like cancer has only just begun.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome.

"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements.

"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"".

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,7753228,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2010,98700,0.061882703959029346
"Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology    DESCRIPTION:       This project's main objective is to develop computerized tools that assist x-ray crystallographers in rapidly determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein. More specifically, this project addresses the following task: given a 3D electron-density map from crystallography and the sequence of the protein, find the most likely layout (i.e. ""trace"") of the protein sequence in 3D. The project will create both automated methods based on statistical machine-learning and computer-vision techniques, as well as visualization tools that support humans doing this layout. These two approaches complement each other and are synergistic.      This project's first specific aim is to develop and empirically evaluate algorithms that interpret crystallographic electron-density maps. The second specific aim is to incorporate structural-biology domain knowledge (secondary-structure prediction and potential-energy calculations) into the project's algorithms for interpreting density maps. The third specific aim is to tightly integrate partial model-construction with phase estimation updates to improve the recognition of 3D protein structures in x-ray reflection data; crystallographers will be able to intervene whenever they desire to help ""steer"" this iterative process. The final specific aim is to develop intuitive and effective modalities - including virtual reality and the use of speech/audio - for the efficient use of crystallographer's time in manual model fitting and validation.      Structural biology has wide relevance to biomedicine, since protein function generally follows from protein form (i.e., its structure). This project's techniques will speed-up the process of determining protein 3D structures, especially from low-quality (i.e., low-resolution) x-ray data, and will be applicable to other structural-biology tasks. Being able to accurately interpret low-resolution data promises to allow higher through put structure determination. The broader impact will include a better understanding of the power of modern theories and algorithms in machine learning and visualization in solving biological problems.         n/a",Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology,7599114,R01LM008796,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phase', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Right-On', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data format', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'improved', 'method development', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'usability', 'virtual reality']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2009,306728,0.11910265095180143
"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.

"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction The goal of this project is to develop new algorithms for protein function prediction. Recent rapid advancements in various technological developments produce biological data of unprecedented amount and complexity. Computational methods are becoming essential components in modern biomedical research. One of greatest challenges facing bioinformatician is the discovery of connections among different data sets and generating novel biological knowledge or hypotheses. Predicting the molecular function of novel proteins is ah urgent task for the post-genomics era. Especially, recent assessment of structural genomic efforts revealed a gap between experimental protein structure determination and the use ofthe structural knowledge for gaining understanding of biological function of the proteins at the molecular level. We will employ recent developments in discriminative machine learning approaches for constructing a residue-level classification system for function prediction from structure. Existing systems for functional prediction from structure either use global structural and sequence similarities over entire protein chain or use localized similarities such as putative functional sites. Our system will leverage the information from both global and local similarities, and identifies important residues and clusters of residues that are distinctive among different functional families. Our approach is based on and extend over an efficient optimization framework that we developed for protein superfamily classification. We expect that these methodological developments will not only improve the performance of state-of-the-art function prediction, but also help illuminating our understanding ofthe interplay of sequence and structure on defining functional variations among protein families. Beyond this major project, we will work on an additional project that extends the graph theoretical models for multiple sequence alignment we developed earlier to meet the challenge of domain annotation for large new sequence set. The advancement of medical research is partly based on our detailed understanding ofthe functions of genes and proteins.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7625220,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,330166,0.12772424308238137
"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,7467275,R01GM076706,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Muscle Rigidity', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Space Explorations', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2009,233457,0.10672789050011312

"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research. This work is aimed at leading to a universal improvement in the accuracy with which protein structure can be built.           n/a",Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins,7656854,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Homology Modeling', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular mechanics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,286440,0.14151534128502943
"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The uniqueness of our methodologies derives from viewing protein structures as    collections of points (e.g., atom coordinates, or points describing molecular surfaces) in 3D    space, disregarding the order of the residues on the chains. Such computer-vision and    robotics-based algorithms enable comparisons of protein surfaces, interfaces, or protein cores    without being limited by the sequential order. Since the last site visit, we have made    substantial progress in the development of new algorithms. Some of these (docking, and binding    site comparison and detection) have already been described above. To enumerate the methods we    have developed since the last site visit: residue-based multiple protein structure comparison    (MultiProt; multiple alignment of proteins in their secondary structure representation (MASS);    multiple alignment of protein structures in the functional group representation and of their    binding sites (MultiBind), and of protein-protein interfaces (MAPPIS); SiteEngine, which    carries out small molecule and protein-binding site recognition and I2ISiteEngine, which    carries out pairwise structural comparisons of interfaces; flexible alignment of protein    structures (FlexProt; Rigid body docking (PatchDock); Flexible hinge-bending docking    (FlexDock); Symmetry docking (SymmDock; Combinatorial docking for folding and multimolecular    assembly (CombDock); Prediction of binding sites using phage display libraries (SiteLight);    and MolAxis to detect channels and cavities in proteins in a highly efficient matter even if    the diameter of these is very small. In addition, using these, two nonredundant datasets of    protein-protein interfaces have been assembled. The methods are all highly efficient with    state of-the-art capabilities. I have already discussed the docking methods, SiteEngine and    MAPPIS (Multiple Alignment of Protein-Protein InterfaceS). Below I briefly describe FlexProt,    MASS, MultiProt and MolAxis. Most methods for multiple alignment start from the pairwise    alignment solutions. In contrast, MASS and MultiProt derive multiple alignments from    simultaneous superpositions of input molecules. Further, both methods do not require that all    input molecules participate in the alignment. Actually, they efficiently detect high scoring    partial multiple alignments for all possible number of molecules in the input. MASS (Multiple    Alignment by Secondary Structures) and MultiProt (Multiple Proteins) are fully automated    highly efficient techniques to detect multiple structural alignments of protein structures and    detect common geometrical cores between input molecules. Furthermore, both methods are    sequence-order independent. MASS is based on a two-level alignment, using both secondary    structure and atomic representation. Utilizing secondary structure information aids in    filtering out noisy solutions and achieves efficiency and robustness. MASS is capable of    detecting nontopological structural motifs, where the secondary structures are arranged in a    different order on the chains. Further, MASS is able to detect not only structural motifs,    shared by all input molecules, but also motifs shared only by subsets of the molecules. We    have demonstrated its ability to handle on the order of tens of molecules, to detect    nontopological motifs and to find biologically meaningful alignments within nonpredefined    subsets of the input. MASS is available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MASS/. MultiProt    considers protein structures as represented by points in space, where the points are either    the C-alpha coordinates or the C-alpha and atoms or geometric center of the side chain.    MultiProt is available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MultiProt/. We have illustrated the    power of both methods on a range of applications. The order-independence allows application of    MultiProt to binding sites and protein-protein interfaces, making MultiProt an extremely    useful structural tool. MolAxis is a freely available, easy-to-use web server for    identification of channels that connect buried cavities to the outside of macromolecules and    for transmembrane (TM) channels in proteins. Biological channels are essential for    physiological processes such as electrolyte and metabolite transport across membranes and    enzyme catalysis, and can play a role in substrate specificity. Motivated by the importance of    channel identification in macromolecules, we developed the MolAxis server. MolAxis implements    state-of-the-art, accurate computational-geometry techniques that reduce the dimensions of the    channel finding problem, rendering the algorithm extremely efficient. Given a protein or    nucleic acid structure in the PDB format, the server outputs all possible channels that    connect buried cavities to the outside of the protein or points to the main channel in TM    proteins. For each channel, the gating residues and the narrowest radius termed 'bottleneck'    are also given along with a full list of the lining residues and the channel surface in a 3D    graphical representation. The users can manipulate advanced parameters and direct the channel    search according to their needs. MolAxis is available as a web server or as a stand-alone    program at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MolAxis. In addition, we have been developing methods    to identify unpredefined tertiary structure of RNA using structural comparison techniques. We    are applying it to the entire database of currently available RNA strucures (NMR and crystal)    to derive a clustered nonredundant dataset or RNA tertiary structures; and to identify RNA    binding sites on protein surfaces for extruded RNA bases in single stranded RNA. Channels and    cavities play important roles in macromolecular functions, serving as access/exit routes for    substrates/products, cofactor and drug binding, catalytic sites, and ligand/protein. In    addition, channels formed by transmembrane (TM) proteins serve as transporters and ion    channels. MolAxis is a new sensitive and fast tool for the identification and classification    of channels and cavities of various sizes and shapes in macromolecules. MolAxis constructs    corridors, which are pathways that represent probable routes taken by small molecules passing    through channels. The outer medial axis of the molecule is the collection of points that have    more than one closest atom. It is composed of two-dimensional surface patches and can be seen    as a skeleton of the complement of the molecule. We have implemented in MolAxis a novel    algorithm that uses state-of-the-art computational geometry techniques to approximate and scan    a useful subset of the outer medial axis, thereby reducing the dimension of the problem and    consequently rendering the algorithm extremely efficient. MolAxis is designed to identify    channels that connect buried cavities to the outside of macromolecules and to identify TM    channels in proteins. We apply MolAxis to enzyme cavities and TM proteins. We further utilize    MolAxis to monitor channel dimensions along Molecular Dynamics trajectories of a human    Cytochrome P450. MolAxis constructs high quality corridors for snapshots at picosecond    time-scale intervals substantiating the gating mechanism in the 2e substrate access channel.    We compare our results with previous tools in terms of accuracy, performance and underlying    theoretical guarantees of finding the desired pathways. MolAxis is available on line as a    web-server and as a stand alone easy-to-use program (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MolAxis/). n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,7965320,ZIABC010442,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Caliber', 'Catalysis', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Core Protein', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Electrolytes', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Internet', 'Ion Channel', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'Radial', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Route', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Skeleton', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'biological research', 'cofactor', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'globular protein', 'instrument', 'macromolecule', 'method development', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'nucleic acid structure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web site']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2009,130272,0.07491648326037699
"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed.

"High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data An outstanding international interdisciplinary team has been assembled that will bring a broad variety of expertise to bear on protein model building, bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics, structural biology, and bioinformatics. The expertise ranges from quantum chemistry to machine learning, and from datamining to high performance computing. Input from collaborating NMR and crystallographers will be essential for validating the protein models. Improving abilities to model proteins can impact public health in important ways by enhancing our basic understanding of protein behavior and by facilitating a more efficient selection of protein targets for drug design. The overall goal is to improve a wide range of protein modeling approaches, both by developing new approaches, and by combining those previously been developed. The specific aims are to: 1) Improve existing comparative (homology) modeling and 2) Improve models obtained by fold-recognition and ab initio procedures to make them useful for molecular replacement. There will be some new methods development. Efforts are in four areas - databases, interaction potentials, conformational sampling, and optimization for combining approaches. We will develop ways to include constraints mined from sub-atomic resolution protein structures using a new HIRES Database (to include structures with resolution < 0.85 A). These will include a structure fragment database, as well as short-range distance distributions. These data can be used to compare modeled structures against the collected data. Uses of the high resolution data will ilclude selecting higher quality fragments to replace poor quality segments in the models, for mining interaction potentials, and as a source of a variety of other high quality information regarding protein structures. Better assessments of protein structural models will be developed, including the assessment of the quality of individual segments within a protein structure; the new metrics developed will be used for assessing the quality of computer-built models, crystal structures and NMR structures, and provide indicators of the expected quality of whole protein models as well as of its segments.

"Computational Methods for Directed Functional Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of gene function (or phenotype) can reduce the scale of an experimental problem by focusing attention on a subset of possible experiments. Current function annotation databases-e.g., the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) annotation of genes with Gene Ontology (GO) functions-are critically important resources, but were not designed to host computational predictions Although SGD and several other annotation databases label predictions as such, they provide no measures of confidence. The need exists for quantitative predictions, as distinct from qualitative ""somebody said so"" predictions. Probabilistic scoring systems, in which the score communicates the probability of veracity, are likely to be the most useful.  We will generate probabilistic predictions by developing probabilistic models for predicting function and phenotype. For reasons of data availability, we use S. cerevisiae and C. elegans as model systems.  We will also generate probabilistic models to predict protein and genetic interactions. We will exploit probabilistic networks of protein and genetic interaction in several ways. We will apply ideas from communication theory (2-terminal network reliability) to predict new members of protein complexes from probabilistic protein networks. We will develop computational methods to guide efficient discovery of genetic interactions in S. cerevisiae, as a model for guiding future high-throughput studies in metazoans. We will exploit probabilistic synthetic lethal interaction networks to identify drug mechanism of action.  We will disseminate predictions to the broader biomedical community. We propose a distributed quantitative prediction resource inspired by the DAS system of distributed genome annotation. We will adapt previously developed interfaces for browsing, searching, and retrieving probabilistic annotations to enhance their utility.  In Aim 1. we develop, apply, and validate methods for predicting function, phenotype, physical and genetic interaction in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans.  In Aim 2. we exploit probabilistic networks of protein and genetic interaction in S. cerevisiae to elucidate network structure, to guide functional genomic experiments, and to reveal drug mechanism of action.

"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM).The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HMdistances. The long term goal is to create a meta-server that will become a standard and will revolutionize the protein structure prediction field in an analogous way to the revolution that PSI-BLAST brought about in the sequence-comparison field, a few years ago. n/a",Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server,7576912,R01GM073814,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Code', 'Complement Factor B', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Jackals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Running', 'Services', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2009,239823,0.09051068972772652
"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The traditional view of protein evolution has been that all protein domains are descendents of distinct evolutionary lines, that there are a relatively small number of such lines (about 1000), and that these lines are all of relatively ancient origin. Two new bodies of evidence make that view untenable. First, analysis of sets of fully sequenced genomes shows that most protein families appear to be small, and narrowly distributed in phylogenetic space, apparently implying recent emergence. Second, analysis of the relationship between known protein structures shows that there are many more than a 1000 distinct folds, appearing to imply many more evolutionary lines. The large discrepancy between theory and fact has been clear for some time and a number of explanations have been put forward. But so far there has been no definitive study of alternatives. In this project we will systematically and quantitatively investigate four separate hypotheses, each of which may account for some share of the large number of protein folds and apparently young proteins: that these (1) are the result of generation of new open reading frames or frame shifted older ones; (2) are the outcome of extensive recombination of portions of older proteins; (3) are laterally transferred from unexplored parts of phylogenetic space; (4) are part of larger older families where there has been rapid sequence change, such that not all relatives are found. To investigate these hypotheses we will develop and extend a set of computational methods. These include methods of building protein families; reliably estimating the age of protein families, detecting lateral gene transfer effects; determining to what extent members of families are likely to have been detected with sequence methods; more quantitatively determining whether protein structures are evolutionarily related; searching for remote structure and sequence relationships; and analyzing a range of protein properties as a function of family age. We will also construct a web resource for distributing the results and soliciting extensive community annotation and discussion.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.           Project Narrative Understanding the structural and functional adaptive properties of protein molecules underpins many aspects of medicine, particularly the emergence of new viruses, drug design, and combating resistance to new therapeutics in infectious diseases.",Mechanisms of Protein Structure Evolution,7583339,R01GM081511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Appearance', 'Bacteriophages', 'Calibration', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Generations', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Virus', 'base', 'combat', 'genome sequencing', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'numb protein', 'prokaryotic kingdom', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,110192,0.12860159272572907
"Recognizing protein folds with discriminative learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One (1) of the fundamental problems in computational biology is the prediction of a protein's 3D structural class -- that is, recognition of its fold  from its linear sequence of amino acids. The proposed project aims to develop computational methods and tools for recognizing protein folds. The first specific aim involves building and delivering to the scientific community a web-based, discriminative fold-recognition software engine. This tool will instantiate for the first time in a user-friendly form a discriminative fold-recognition algorithm. This type of algorithm has been described and repeatedly validated in the scientific literature over the past 5 years, but no easy-to-use software tools yet exists to bring this technology to the end user. The second specific aim improves upon existing fold-recognition algorithms by exploiting the inherently multiclass nature of the problem. Previous approaches have treated each fold class independently, thereby sacrificing statistical power. This project will produce algorithms and software that dramatically improve our ability to recognize, from the primary amino acid sequence, subtle structural similarities among proteins.         n/a",Recognizing protein folds with discriminative learning,7638576,R01GM074257,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Blast Cell', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Homologous Gene', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'improved', 'markov model', 'next generation', 'protein folding', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2009,297142,0.06626789720868004
"Nonparametric Analysis of Reverse-Phase Protein Lysate Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play major roles as biological effectors and diagnostic markers. One level of its complexity is due to the post-translational modifications that cannot be detected at the genome level, which makes it desirable to measure proteins directly. Recently, some new protein microarray technologies have begun to bloom for this purpose. We focus on the reverse-phase protein lysate arrays that allow us to quantify the relative expression levels of a protein in many different cellular samples simultaneously. One advantage of this technology is that it requires a small amount of cells with just one antibody binding. However, it is more challenging to analyze protein lysate arrays than DNA arrays, and at the present time, the applications of protein lysate arrays are still in the exploratory stage with a lack of reliable statistical tools for quantifying the information (including the uncertainty) from protein arrays. We find that it is difficult, if at all possible, to model all the samples with a simple parametric family of response curves. We propose a robust approach to quantify the protein lysate arrays by fitting a monotone nonparametric response curve to all samples on the same array. The proposed method has been shown to fit the data more adaptively, avoiding bias due to parameterization. We aim to incorporate the modern shrinkage ideas in statistics into the nonparametric approach, leading to more stable quantification in time course experiments where the number of replicates is small at each time point. We also propose to use wild-bootstrap for assessing uncertainty of the protein concentration estimates and for assessing the influence of such uncertainties in follow-up analyses. When completed, our research will enable more reliable analysis of protein lysate arrays, and provide feedback to chip makers to improve the design of the protein microarrays, both of which are essential in making lysate arrays a useful tool in biological and medical research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to efficient and effective statistical and computing tools for analyzing protein lysate array data that have wide-ranging applications in biomedical and public health research, as evidenced by the recent discovery of target protein in signal pathway profiling related to prostate cancer. These tools are needed to support better applications of protein lysate array technology in clinical and biomedical research.              Project Narrative Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to efficient and effective statistical and computing tools for analyzing protein lysate array data that have wide-ranging applications in biomedical and public health research, as evidenced by the recent discovery of target protein in signal pathway profiling related to prostate cancer.

"Protein recognition for modular domains    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein is essential for almost every biological process and the interaction between proteins and their interacting partners play critical roles in the functioning cells. Since mutations that disrupt the protein-protein interactions result in many diseases, it is important to understand the biochemical mechanisms of protein recognition, which is important for deciphering protein interaction network and designing potent drugs with high specificity against protein targets. Our long term goal is to develop theoretical models for describing protein binding specificity and reliably predict protein-protein interactions. In the proposed project, we have the following specific aims. Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that combines computer modeling and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the interaction interface between modular domains and their peptide ligands. We will test this method on several modular domains including SH3, SH2 and PDZ domains that bind to specific peptide sequences. Aim 2, we will systematically predict interacting peptides in the yeast genome of all yeast SH3 domains. Aim 3, we will experimentally validate the predictions in vitro to assess the performance of the computational method. We will also conduct in vivo experiments to examine the biological significance of a set of selected domain-peptide interactions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-protein interactions play critical roles in the cell and mutations that disrupt these interactions result in many diseases.

"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences. In so doing, this work addresses a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in ""post-genomic biology"": linking massive and exponentially growing amounts of raw sequence and structure data to the molecular basis of biological function.           n/a",Comparative genomics of protein structure and function,7586248,R01GM079656,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PAWR protein', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Solvents', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'conformer', 'database structure', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2009,281344,0.1129649199482034
"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Sequencing of the human genome is complete, but figuring out where genes are located, how they function, and how they cause or prevent human diseases like cancer has only just begun.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome.

"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies,7658677,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28202,0.055973597706223184
"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7676045,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'meetings', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein profiling', 'research study', 'response', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2009,494433,0.058442604896095894
"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"".

"Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations Amino acid mutations in human proteins are often associated with inherited predispositions to specific diseases. Yet most observed missense polymorphisms, those involving a single nucleotide change leading to a changed amino acid, have not been characterized in terms of their effects on protein structure and function. We hypothesize that many of the most deleterious missense mutations affect protein function in one of two ways: 1) by altering interaction of proteins with other molecules, including other proteins, DMA, and small ligands; or 2) by altering stability of the protein. Both of these mechanisms depend primarily on the location of the mutation and its physical properties: changes in protein interactions are usually caused by mutations in or very near to a binding site; changes in stability are usually caused by mutations of buried hydrophobic residues. The aim of this proposal is to develop a computational system for predicting the functional effects of missense mutations through homology modeling of protein complexes. New functional data on 1000 random mutations in two dimeric enzyme systems will be obtained to train and test the model. The primary application of this computational system will be to genes associated with the development of cancer. Cancer is usually linked to a number of genetic changes, some inherited and others somatic. These include loss of DNA-damage repair, breakdown of cell-cycle checkpoints, and resistance to apoptosis. Each of these processes requires many protein interactions, often in large protein complexes. These interactions may be compromised by missense mutations that alter individual interactions between molecules or mutations that lower protein stability. n/a",Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations,7582317,R01GM073784,"['Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Apoptosis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Genome Anatomy Project', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystathionine beta-Synthase', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'HIV Protease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Ions', 'Lac Repressors', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH)', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Muramidase', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'dimer', 'graphical user interface', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'monomer', 'open source', 'physical property', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R01,2009,307176,0.09838652302031259
"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,7559157,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2009,98400,0.061882703959029346
"Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology    DESCRIPTION:       This project's main objective is to develop computerized tools that assist x-ray crystallographers in rapidly determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein. More specifically, this project addresses the following task: given a 3D electron-density map from crystallography and the sequence of the protein, find the most likely layout (i.e. ""trace"") of the protein sequence in 3D. The project will create both automated methods based on statistical machine-learning and computer-vision techniques, as well as visualization tools that support humans doing this layout. These two approaches complement each other and are synergistic.      This project's first specific aim is to develop and empirically evaluate algorithms that interpret crystallographic electron-density maps. The second specific aim is to incorporate structural-biology domain knowledge (secondary-structure prediction and potential-energy calculations) into the project's algorithms for interpreting density maps. The third specific aim is to tightly integrate partial model-construction with phase estimation updates to improve the recognition of 3D protein structures in x-ray reflection data; crystallographers will be able to intervene whenever they desire to help ""steer"" this iterative process. The final specific aim is to develop intuitive and effective modalities - including virtual reality and the use of speech/audio - for the efficient use of crystallographer's time in manual model fitting and validation.      Structural biology has wide relevance to biomedicine, since protein function generally follows from protein form (i.e., its structure). This project's techniques will speed-up the process of determining protein 3D structures, especially from low-quality (i.e., low-resolution) x-ray data, and will be applicable to other structural-biology tasks. Being able to accurately interpret low-resolution data promises to allow higher through put structure determination.

"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.

"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  I am a postdoctoral scholar associated with Steven Brenner's lab at Berkeley, working on structural biology and computational genomics. My long-term vision is to develop new algorithms for inferring protein evolution and function from sequence and structure. Currently I am working on algorithms that can automatically classify a protein into its proper superfamily. The long-term goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of protein structure classification and function prediction.      The superfamily defines ancient protein homology. Protein superfamily classification remains a challenging task, even when 3D structure is available. Currently this task still requires experts' manual work. We believe that the classification of protein superfamilies relies on the integration of sequence information and structure information. We will employ recent breakthroughs in kernel-based machine learning approaches for combining different sources of information. We will also develop structure-based discriminative profile models for protein superfamilies. We expect these algorithmic developments will not only result in a practical tool for superfamily classification, but they will also improve our understanding of the interplay of sequence and structure on defining very remote homology.      We will extend our structure-based discriminative profile models for protein classification to function prediction. We will develop new methods for the identification of structure-sequence signatures of protein functioin. In addition, we will extend the graph theoretical models for multiple sequence alignment I developed during my Ph.D. study to meet the challenge of domain annotation for large new sequence set.      The advancement of medical research is partly based on our detailed understanding of the functions of genes and proteins.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7389563,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,320418,0.12772424308238137
"Bioinformatics approaches to characterizing amino acid function.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying residues of importance in the protein products of genes is a challenging and important problem for informatics, genome annotation, molecular biology, biochemistry and drug discovery. Functional annotation of genes is inherently hierarchical; genes can be annotated at the level of genome sequence, transcript variant, protein product, protein domain, nucleotide or amino acid. Only a few resources annotate protein function at the level of the amino acid and language relating residue function and gene product sequence, structure and expression is challenging. To address this, I am investigating how sequence, evolutionary and structural descriptors can be used to quantify function. I am applying this knowledge to develop methods that can associate residues with known functional annotations, perform annotation transfer onto an experimentally determined or modeled protein structure, and determine the likely molecular effects of mutation, thus creating a framework for residue annotation. One of the greatest challenges for the computational biologist is identifying features (or attributes) that are useful for classification of genomic data. With this effort, we will continue our work describing novel features for classification of functional sites and we will test them using supervised machine learning tools. We will do this by, 1) testing the power of several diverse functional features for classification of catalytic residues in proteins, 2) applying these features to other important residue functional annotation problems, and 3) evaluate features based on homologous sequences. This research is important for understanding the molecular basis of diseases such as cancer and pharmacogenetics data from a molecular perspective.

"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The uniqueness of our methodologies derives from viewing protein structures as       collections of points (e.g., atom coordinates, or points describing molecular surfaces) in 3D       space, disregarding the order of the residues on the chains. Such computer-vision and       robotics-based algorithms enable comparisons of protein surfaces, interfaces, or protein cores       without being limited by the sequential order. Since the last site visit, we have made       substantial progress in the development of new algorithms. Some of these (docking, and binding       site comparison and detection) have already been described above. To enumerate the methods we       have developed since the last site visit: residue-based multiple protein structure comparison       (MultiProt; multiple alignment of proteins in their secondary structure representation (MASS);       multiple alignment of protein structures in the functional group representation and of their       binding sites (MultiBind), and of protein-protein interfaces (MAPPIS); SiteEngine, which       carries out small molecule and protein-binding site recognition and I2ISiteEngine, which       carries out pairwise structural comparisons of interfaces; flexible alignment of protein       structures (FlexProt; Rigid body docking (PatchDock); Flexible hinge-bending docking       (FlexDock); Symmetry docking (SymmDock; Combinatorial docking for folding and multimolecular       assembly (CombDock); Prediction of binding sites using phage display libraries (SiteLight);       and MolAxis to detect channels and cavities in proteins in a highly efficient matter even if       the diameter of these is very small. In addition, using these, two nonredundant datasets of       protein-protein interfaces have been assembled. The methods are all highly efficient with       state of-the-art capabilities. I have already discussed the docking methods, SiteEngine and       MAPPIS (Multiple Alignment of Protein-Protein InterfaceS). Below I briefly describe FlexProt,       MASS, MultiProt and MolAxis. Most methods for multiple alignment start from the pairwise       alignment solutions. In contrast, MASS and MultiProt derive multiple alignments from       simultaneous superpositions of input molecules. Further, both methods do not require that all       input molecules participate in the alignment. Actually, they efficiently detect high scoring       partial multiple alignments for all possible number of molecules in the input. MASS (Multiple       Alignment by Secondary Structures) and MultiProt (Multiple Proteins) are fully automated       highly efficient techniques to detect multiple structural alignments of protein structures and       detect common geometrical cores between input molecules. Furthermore, both methods are       sequence-order independent. MASS is based on a two-level alignment, using both secondary       structure and atomic representation. Utilizing secondary structure information aids in       filtering out noisy solutions and achieves efficiency and robustness. MASS is capable of       detecting nontopological structural motifs, where the secondary structures are arranged in a       different order on the chains. Further, MASS is able to detect not only structural motifs,       shared by all input molecules, but also motifs shared only by subsets of the molecules. We       have demonstrated its ability to handle on the order of tens of molecules, to detect       nontopological motifs and to find biologically meaningful alignments within nonpredefined       subsets of the input. MASS is available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MASS/. MultiProt       considers protein structures as represented by points in space, where the points are either       the C-alpha coordinates or the C-alpha and atoms or geometric center of the side chain.       MultiProt is available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MultiProt/. We have illustrated the       power of both methods on a range of applications. The order-independence allows application of       MultiProt to binding sites and protein-protein interfaces, making MultiProt an extremely       useful structural tool. FlexProt is a novel technique for the alignment of flexible proteins.       Unlike all previous algorithms to solve structural comparisons allowing hinge-bending motions,       FlexProt does not require an a priori knowledge of the location of the hinge(s). FlexProt       carries out the flexible alignment superimposing the matching rigid subpart pairs, and detects       the flexible hinge regions simultaneously. Protein structural analysis requires algorithms       that can deal with molecular flexibility. FlexProt efficiently detects maximal congruent rigid       fragments in both molecules. Transforming the task into a graph theoretic problem, it       calculates the optimal arrangement of previously detected maximal congruent rigid fragments.       FlexProt performs a structural comparison of a pair of proteins 300 amino acids long in about       seven seconds on a standard desktop PC. FlexProt can be accessed via the web at       bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FlexProt/. MolAxis is a freely available, easy-to-use web server for       identification of channels that connect buried cavities to the outside of macromolecules and       for transmembrane (TM) channels in proteins. Biological channels are essential for       physiological processes such as electrolyte and metabolite transport across membranes and       enzyme catalysis, and can play a role in substrate specificity. Motivated by the importance of       channel identification in macromolecules, we developed the MolAxis server. MolAxis implements       state-of-the-art, accurate computational-geometry techniques that reduce the dimensions of the       channel finding problem, rendering the algorithm extremely efficient. Given a protein or       nucleic acid structure in the PDB format, the server outputs all possible channels that       connect buried cavities to the outside of the protein or points to the main channel in TM       proteins. For each channel, the gating residues and the narrowest radius termed 'bottleneck'       are also given along with a full list of the lining residues and the channel surface in a 3D       graphical representation. The users can manipulate advanced parameters and direct the channel       search according to their needs. MolAxis is available as a web server or as a stand-alone       program at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MolAxis. In addition, we have been developing methods       to identify unpredefined tertiary structure of RNA using structural comparison techniques. We       are applying it to the entire database of currently available RNA strucures (NMR and crystal)       to derive a clustered nonredundant dataset or RNA tertiary structures; and to identify RNA       binding sites on protein surfaces for extruded RNA bases in single stranded RNA. n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,7733033,Z01BC010442,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Arts', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Caliber', 'Catalysis', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Collection', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Core Protein', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decompression Sickness', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Electrolytes', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Phage Display', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'Range', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Score', 'Series', 'Side', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'biological research', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'experience', 'functional group', 'globular protein', 'instrument', 'macromolecule', 'method development', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'nucleic acid structure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'radius bone structure', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,Z01,2008,168288,0.07989276966138598
"Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A detailed and accurate understanding of the structure of proteins is one cornerstone of modern biomedical research, and an explicit goal of the NIH is to define the structure of all proteins either by accurate experimental determination or comparative model-building. The most successful structure prediction approaches employ empirical knowledge-based energy terms derived from features of known protein structures - most notably single-residue ???-distributions, backbone-dependent side chain rotamer preferences, and tight packing criteria. One known unrealistic feature of these prediction programs is the assumption of a fixed ideal geometry for the backbone. The driving hypothesis behind this proposal is that there exists a largely unappreciated but real, systematic, significant and pervasive variation in backbone bond angles and peptide planarity that occurs as a function of backbone torsion angles, and accounting properly for this variation will be required to achieve X-ray crystal structure quality for comparative models. The overall goal of this work is to generate accurate empirical values for this covalent variation that will lead to tangible improvements in the accuracy of structures produced by comparative modeling and de novo structure prediction as well as by X-ray crystallography. We propose to achieve this overall goal by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to design, develop, and make available a flexibly-searchable database containing bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles for all structures known at better than 1.75 ¿ resolution (currently ~500,000 residues); 2) to use conventional query-based and modern machine learning approaches to derive accurate empirical information from the database about the systematic correlation of local conformation with variations in covalent geometry; and 3) to create a modular conformation-dependent expected covalent geometry library and to facilitate its incorporation into leading applications for comparative and crystallographic protein structure modeling. With the dramatically increased number of ultrahigh-resolution resolution crystal structures now known, the time is ripe for construction of this Protein Geometry Database that will provide facile access to a massive treasure trove of reliable and detailed empirical information about protein structure. To be done well, this work will require painstaking attention to detail and an intimate familiarity with the limitations of crystallographic refinement and the principles of protein structure. Dr. Karplus is well-suited to lead this work as he has a 20+-year track record of quality crystallographic structure determinations combined with contributions of more general insights into protein structure, among them being the pioneering characterization of the conformation-dependent variations in covalent geometry that serves as this project's foundation. Collaborations with world-leading groups in structure prediction, in crystallographic refinement and structure validation, and in knowledge-based library development ensure a rapid and effective translation of the gleaned information into improvements in protein modeling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteins are responsible for carrying out most of the processes of life and their function depends exquisitely on their structure, even on the tiniest structural details. For this reason, determining accurate structures of proteins is a cornerstone of modern biomedical research. This work is aimed at leading to a universal improvement in the accuracy with which protein structure can be built.           n/a",Empirical conformation-dependent covalent geometry variation in proteins,7525973,R01GM083136,"['Accounting', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalysis', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Crystallography', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Homology Modeling', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Numbers', 'Object Attachment', 'Online Systems', 'Other Resources', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'design', 'disease-causing mutation', 'falls', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular mechanics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,213756,0.14151534128502943
"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7380093,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2008,280033,0.06148631873904849
"High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data An outstanding international interdisciplinary team has been assembled that will bring a broad variety of expertise to bear on protein model building, bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics, structural biology, and bioinformatics. The expertise ranges from quantum chemistry to machine learning, and from datamining to high performance computing. Input from collaborating NMR and crystallographers will be essential for validating the protein models. Improving abilities to model proteins can impact public health in important ways by enhancing our basic understanding of protein behavior and by facilitating a more efficient selection of protein targets for drug design. The overall goal is to improve a wide range of protein modeling approaches, both by developing new approaches, and by combining those previously been developed. The specific aims are to: 1) Improve existing comparative (homology) modeling and 2) Improve models obtained by fold-recognition and ab initio procedures to make them useful for molecular replacement. There will be some new methods development. Efforts are in four areas - databases, interaction potentials, conformational sampling, and optimization for combining approaches. We will develop ways to include constraints mined from sub-atomic resolution protein structures using a new HIRES Database (to include structures with resolution < 0.85 A). These will include a structure fragment database, as well as short-range distance distributions. These data can be used to compare modeled structures against the collected data. Uses of the high resolution data will ilclude selecting higher quality fragments to replace poor quality segments in the models, for mining interaction potentials, and as a source of a variety of other high quality information regarding protein structures. Better assessments of protein structural models will be developed, including the assessment of the quality of individual segments within a protein structure; the new metrics developed will be used for assessing the quality of computer-built models, crystal structures and NMR structures, and provide indicators of the expected quality of whole protein models as well as of its segments. New ways to sample protein motions will be pursued. Combining diverse methods will lead to significant gains in the computer modeling of protein structures. Extensive testing and validation will be carried out at each stage and in each part of the project to ensure large gains in model accuracy. n/a",High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data,7495009,R01GM081680,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CASP6 gene', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cellular biology', 'Cereals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Performance Computing', 'Homology Modeling', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medal', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monsters', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Polishes', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Torsion', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'member', 'method development', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular modeling', 'network models', 'novel strategies', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'quantum', 'quantum chemistry', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'scaffold', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,231555,0.14713451925011625
"Computational Methods for Directed Functional Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of gene function (or phenotype) can reduce the scale of an experimental problem by focusing attention on a subset of possible experiments. Current function annotation databases-e.g., the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) annotation of genes with Gene Ontology (GO) functions-are critically important resources, but were not designed to host computational predictions Although SGD and several other annotation databases label predictions as such, they provide no measures of confidence. The need exists for quantitative predictions, as distinct from qualitative ""somebody said so"" predictions. Probabilistic scoring systems, in which the score communicates the probability of veracity, are likely to be the most useful.  We will generate probabilistic predictions by developing probabilistic models for predicting function and phenotype. For reasons of data availability, we use S. cerevisiae and C. elegans as model systems.  We will also generate probabilistic models to predict protein and genetic interactions. We will exploit probabilistic networks of protein and genetic interaction in several ways. We will apply ideas from communication theory (2-terminal network reliability) to predict new members of protein complexes from probabilistic protein networks. We will develop computational methods to guide efficient discovery of genetic interactions in S. cerevisiae, as a model for guiding future high-throughput studies in metazoans. We will exploit probabilistic synthetic lethal interaction networks to identify drug mechanism of action.  We will disseminate predictions to the broader biomedical community. We propose a distributed quantitative prediction resource inspired by the DAS system of distributed genome annotation. We will adapt previously developed interfaces for browsing, searching, and retrieving probabilistic annotations to enhance their utility.  In Aim 1. we develop, apply, and validate methods for predicting function, phenotype, physical and genetic interaction in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans.  In Aim 2. we exploit probabilistic networks of protein and genetic interaction in S. cerevisiae to elucidate network structure, to guide functional genomic experiments, and to reveal drug mechanism of action.

It builds on extensive prior work on development of protein tagging methods by the co-PIs and on development of software systems for automated analysis of subcellular patterns in fluorescence microscope images by the PI. 25,000 independent cell lines expressing GFP protein fusions will be created in NIH 3T3 cells using high-throughput CD-tagging (protein-trapping) methods. As the cell lines are created, high-resolution fluorescence microscope images will be collected using fluorescence microscopy and the gene and protein tagged in each cell line will be determined by high-throughput molecular analysis methods. The images will be subjected to automated, computerized image analysis to group proteins with statistically indistinguishable patterns. The determined location for each protein will be compared to whatever information is available from protein databases, journal articles and location predictors. Each assigned location will be accompanied by a confidence estimate derived from combining these sources. In addition, the images for each protein group will be used to build generative models that can synthesize new protein distributions statistically equivalent to the original images.

"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM).The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HMdistances.

"Optimization of Stuctures and Networks of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application has three major aims that exploit the use of mathematical programming tools for biophysically motivated problems. The first goal is the refinement of protein structures that are obtained from homology. Structures based on homology are rarely of atomic resolution; a resolution which is necessary for detailed modeling of protein function, and for the design of drug molecules. Based on mathematical programming approach a new class of energy functions, suitable for the refinement problem, will be designed. The second goal is to investigate a new type of network; the network of sequence flow between protein structures. We examine the process in which new sequences, generated by point mutations, remain in the current fold, or switch to other stable structures (we exclude sequences with no stable fold). The adjustments to the structure are accepted or rejected based on stability criterion. The net. work defines a master equation which makes it possible to investigate past (ancient) folds, and future structures that serve as attractors. The third aim examines the network of protein-protein (physical) interactions and will be examined with bioinformatics and biophysical approaches. Comparison will be made between the network of sequence flow and the network of protein-protein interactions to better understand the evolution of biological mechanisms and recognition.

"Recognizing protein folds with discriminative learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One (1) of the fundamental problems in computational biology is the prediction of a protein's 3D structural class -- that is, recognition of its fold  from its linear sequence of amino acids. The proposed project aims to develop computational methods and tools for recognizing protein folds. The first specific aim involves building and delivering to the scientific community a web-based, discriminative fold-recognition software engine. This tool will instantiate for the first time in a user-friendly form a discriminative fold-recognition algorithm. This type of algorithm has been described and repeatedly validated in the scientific literature over the past 5 years, but no easy-to-use software tools yet exists to bring this technology to the end user. The second specific aim improves upon existing fold-recognition algorithms by exploiting the inherently multiclass nature of the problem. Previous approaches have treated each fold class independently, thereby sacrificing statistical power. This project will produce algorithms and software that dramatically improve our ability to recognize, from the primary amino acid sequence, subtle structural similarities among proteins.         n/a",Recognizing protein folds with discriminative learning,7492267,R01GM074257,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Blast Cell', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Homologous Gene', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'improved', 'markov model', 'next generation', 'protein folding', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2008,299068,0.06626789720868004
"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences.

A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions:Computational Studies,7546079,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'concept', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2008,32027,0.055973597706223184
"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7622959,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Numbers', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'research study', 'response', 'software development', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2008,536748,0.058442604896095894
"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"".

"Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations Amino acid mutations in human proteins are often associated with inherited predispositions to specific diseases. Yet most observed missense polymorphisms, those involving a single nucleotide change leading to a changed amino acid, have not been characterized in terms of their effects on protein structure and function. We hypothesize that many of the most deleterious missense mutations affect protein function in one of two ways: 1) by altering interaction of proteins with other molecules, including other proteins, DMA, and small ligands; or 2) by altering stability of the protein. Both of these mechanisms depend primarily on the location of the mutation and its physical properties: changes in protein interactions are usually caused by mutations in or very near to a binding site; changes in stability are usually caused by mutations of buried hydrophobic residues. The aim of this proposal is to develop a computational system for predicting the functional effects of missense mutations through homology modeling of protein complexes. New functional data on 1000 random mutations in two dimeric enzyme systems will be obtained to train and test the model. The primary application of this computational system will be to genes associated with the development of cancer. Cancer is usually linked to a number of genetic changes, some inherited and others somatic. These include loss of DNA-damage repair, breakdown of cell-cycle checkpoints, and resistance to apoptosis. Each of these processes requires many protein interactions, often in large protein complexes. These interactions may be compromised by missense mutations that alter individual interactions between molecules or mutations that lower protein stability. n/a",Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations,7369808,R01GM073784,"['Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Apoptosis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Genome Anatomy Project', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystathionine beta-Synthase', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'HIV Protease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Ions', 'Lac Repressors', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH)', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Muramidase', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'dimer', 'graphical user interface', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'monomer', 'open source', 'physical property', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R01,2008,307176,0.09838652302031259
"Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology    DESCRIPTION:       This project's main objective is to develop computerized tools that assist x-ray crystallographers in rapidly determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein. More specifically, this project addresses the following task: given a 3D electron-density map from crystallography and the sequence of the protein, find the most likely layout (i.e. ""trace"") of the protein sequence in 3D. The project will create both automated methods based on statistical machine-learning and computer-vision techniques, as well as visualization tools that support humans doing this layout. These two approaches complement each other and are synergistic.      This project's first specific aim is to develop and empirically evaluate algorithms that interpret crystallographic electron-density maps. The second specific aim is to incorporate structural-biology domain knowledge (secondary-structure prediction and potential-energy calculations) into the project's algorithms for interpreting density maps. The third specific aim is to tightly integrate partial model-construction with phase estimation updates to improve the recognition of 3D protein structures in x-ray reflection data; crystallographers will be able to intervene whenever they desire to help ""steer"" this iterative process. The final specific aim is to develop intuitive and effective modalities - including virtual reality and the use of speech/audio - for the efficient use of crystallographer's time in manual model fitting and validation.      Structural biology has wide relevance to biomedicine, since protein function generally follows from protein form (i.e., its structure). This project's techniques will speed-up the process of determining protein 3D structures, especially from low-quality (i.e., low-resolution) x-ray data, and will be applicable to other structural-biology tasks. Being able to accurately interpret low-resolution data promises to allow higher through put structure determination. The broader impact will include a better understanding of the power of modern theories and algorithms in machine learning and visualization in solving biological problems.         n/a",Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology,7216865,R01LM008796,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Freedom', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Object Attachment', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phase', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Right-On', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'desire', 'electron density', 'improved', 'method development', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'usability', 'virtual reality']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2007,313156,0.11910265095180143
"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.

"Algorithms for protein superfamily classification and function prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  I am a postdoctoral scholar associated with Steven Brenner's lab at Berkeley, working on structural biology and computational genomics. My long-term vision is to develop new algorithms for inferring protein evolution and function from sequence and structure. Currently I am working on algorithms that can automatically classify a protein into its proper superfamily. The long-term goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of protein structure classification and function prediction.      The superfamily defines ancient protein homology. Protein superfamily classification remains a challenging task, even when 3D structure is available. Currently this task still requires experts' manual work. We believe that the classification of protein superfamilies relies on the integration of sequence information and structure information. We will employ recent breakthroughs in kernel-based machine learning approaches for combining different sources of information. We will also develop structure-based discriminative profile models for protein superfamilies. We expect these algorithmic developments will not only result in a practical tool for superfamily classification, but they will also improve our understanding of the interplay of sequence and structure on defining very remote homology.      We will extend our structure-based discriminative profile models for protein classification to function prediction. We will develop new methods for the identification of structure-sequence signatures of protein functioin. In addition, we will extend the graph theoretical models for multiple sequence alignment I developed during my Ph.D. study to meet the challenge of domain annotation for large new sequence set.      The advancement of medical research is partly based on our detailed understanding of the functions of genes and proteins.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7207482,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,323192,0.12772424308238137
"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,7258945,R01GM076706,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Muscle Rigidity', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Space Explorations', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'research study', 'restraint', 'structural biology', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2007,230753,0.10672789050011312
"Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome project and related genome projects have stirred great hopes for improving our understanding and treatment of diseases. Central to this process is the automated detection of functional motifs and classification of protein sequences into families and/or subfamilies. Conventional approaches for protein sequence classification usually employ sequence alignment methods; other methods depend on the choice of the features included in the training sets, and on accuracy and availability of data. We propose an alignment-independent classification approach based on a search engine technology that had been successfully used in classifying medical records. Each protein is represented by a multidimensional vector, the elements of which refer to the protein's most discriminative eta-grams (sequences of eta amino acids). Preliminary studies on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed that a simple Naive Bayes classifier using straightforward eta-gram feature   selection in its preprocessing, can outperform existing classifiers including support vector machines on previously investigated, standardized GPCR sequence data subsets. Jackknife tests applied to the Protein Information Resource (PIR) Protein Sequence Database PSD and to the Pfam database (DB) of protein families showed that approximately 70% of the protein sequences are classified correctly.  More significantly, the most discriminative eta-grams in a given protein family appear to have a functional or structural role, as suggested by their comparison with the sequence motifs known to be conserved or active in existing DBs and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of representative members of the family. Encouraged by these results, we propose to pursue the following specific aims:   (1) develop a new computational tool for protein sequence analysis and protein classification based on eta-gram distributions, (2) build a comprehensive DB of protein families based on eta-gram distributions and investigate the relationships between this DB and the leading protein classification DBs, (3) determine the functional significance of the top-ranking n-grams, and (4) develop a Java based toolkit that will provide easy-to-use, yet flexible, web interface to researchers from various background. The expected deliverables are the methodology and software for classification without alignment (CWA); a new database of classified proteins, based on CWA; and an on-line server and GUI that will deliver the database and data mining tools to the scientific community in a user-friendly environment.         n/a",Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins,7237368,R01LM007994,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Information Resources', 'International', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Kindling (Neurology)', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Sequence Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Score', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'SwissProt', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'interest', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vector', 'web interface']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,264180,0.13565230360916417
"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.

"Bioinformatics approaches to characterizing amino acid function.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying residues of importance in the protein products of genes is a challenging and important problem for informatics, genome annotation, molecular biology, biochemistry and drug discovery. Functional annotation of genes is inherently hierarchical; genes can be annotated at the level of genome sequence, transcript variant, protein product, protein domain, nucleotide or amino acid. Only a few resources annotate protein function at the level of the amino acid and language relating residue function and gene product sequence, structure and expression is challenging. To address this, I am investigating how sequence, evolutionary and structural descriptors can be used to quantify function. I am applying this knowledge to develop methods that can associate residues with known functional annotations, perform annotation transfer onto an experimentally determined or modeled protein structure, and determine the likely molecular effects of mutation, thus creating a framework for residue annotation. One of the greatest challenges for the computational biologist is identifying features (or attributes) that are useful for classification of genomic data. With this effort, we will continue our work describing novel features for classification of functional sites and we will test them using supervised machine learning tools. We will do this by, 1) testing the power of several diverse functional features for classification of catalytic residues in proteins, 2) applying these features to other important residue functional annotation problems, and 3) evaluate features based on homologous sequences. This research is important for understanding the molecular basis of diseases such as cancer and pharmacogenetics data from a molecular perspective. When completed, scientists will have a rich set of data and tools for basic health research.             n/a",Bioinformatics approaches to characterizing amino acid function.,7220054,K22LM009135,"['Address', 'Ally', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homologous Gene', 'Indium', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Site', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'paralogous gene', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'tool', 'web interface']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K22,2007,155110,0.08267390146700325

"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The uniqueness of our methodologies derives from viewing protein structures as collections of points (e.g., atom coordinates, or points describing molecular surfaces) in 3D space, disregarding the order of the residues on the chains. Such computer-vision and robotics-based algorithms enable comparisons of protein surfaces, interfaces, or protein cores without being limited by the sequential order. Since the last site visit, we have made substantial progress in the development of new algorithms. Some of these (docking, and binding site comparison and detection) have already been described above. To enumerate the methods we have developed since the last site visit: residue-based multiple protein structure comparison (MultiProt; multiple alignment of proteins in their secondary structure representation (MASS); multiple alignment of protein structures in the functional group representation and of their binding sites (MultiBind), and of protein-protein interfaces (MAPPIS); SiteEngine, which carries out small molecule and protein-binding site recognition and I2ISiteEngine, which carries out pairwise structural comparisons of interfaces; flexible alignment of protein structures (FlexProt; Rigid body docking (PatchDock); Flexible hinge-bending docking (FlexDock); Symmetry docking (SymmDock; Combinatorial docking for folding and multimolecular assembly (CombDock); Prediction of binding sites using phage display libraries (SiteLight). In addition, using these, two nonredundant datasets of protein-protein interfaces have been assembled. The methods are all highly efficient with state of-the-art capabilities. I have already discussed the docking methods, SiteEngine and MAPPIS (Multiple Alignment of Protein-Protein InterfaceS). Below I briefly describe FlexProt, MASS and MultiProt. Most methods for multiple alignment start from the pairwise alignment solutions. In contrast, MASS and MultiProt derive multiple alignments from simultaneous superpositions of input molecules. Further, both methods do not require that all input molecules participate in the alignment. Actually, they efficiently detect high scoring partial multiple alignments for all possible number of molecules in the input. MASS (Multiple Alignment by Secondary Structures) and MultiProt (Multiple Proteins) are fully automated highly efficient techniques to detect multiple structural alignments of protein structures and detect common geometrical cores between input molecules. Furthermore, both methods are sequence-order independent. MASS is based on a two-level alignment, using both secondary structure and atomic representation. Utilizing secondary structure information aids in filtering out noisy solutions and achieves efficiency and robustness. MASS is capable of detecting nontopological structural motifs, where the secondary structures are arranged in a different order on the chains. Further, MASS is able to detect not only structural motifs, shared by all input molecules, but also motifs shared only by subsets of the molecules. We have demonstrated its ability to handle on the order of tens of molecules, to detect nontopological motifs and to find biologically meaningful alignments within nonpredefined subsets of the input. MASS is available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MASS/. MultiProt considers protein structures as represented by points in space, where the points are either the C-alpha coordinates or the C-alpha and atoms or geometric center of the side chain. MultiProt is available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MultiProt/. We have illustrated the power of both methods on a range of applications. The order-independence allows application of MultiProt to binding sites and protein-protein interfaces, making MultiProt an extremely useful structural tool. FlexProt is a novel technique for the alignment of flexible proteins. Unlike all previous algorithms to solve structural comparisons allowing hinge-bending motions, FlexProt does not require an a priori knowledge of the location of the hinge(s). FlexProt carries out the flexible alignment superimposing the matching rigid subpart pairs, and detects the flexible hinge regions simultaneously. Protein structural analysis requires algorithms that can deal with molecular flexibility. FlexProt efficiently detects maximal congruent rigid fragments in both molecules. Transforming the task into a graph theoretic problem, it calculates the optimal arrangement of previously detected maximal congruent rigid fragments. FlexProt performs a structural comparison of a pair of proteins 300 amino acids long in about seven seconds on a standard desktop PC. FlexProt can be accessed via the web at bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FlexProt/. In addition, we have been developing a method to identify unpredefined tertiary structure of RNA using structural comparison techniques. We are applying it to the entire database of currently available RNA strucures (NMR and crystal) to derive a clustered nonredundant dataset or RNA tertiary structures.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7268219,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2007,288025,0.06148631873904849
"High-Accuracy Protein Models Derived from Lower Resolution Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An outstanding international interdisciplinary team has been assembled that will bring a broad variety of expertise to bear on protein model building, bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics, structural biology, and bioinformatics. The expertise ranges from quantum chemistry to machine learning, and from data-mining to high performance computing. Input from collaborators in NMR and crystallography will be essential for validating the protein models. Improving abilities to model proteins can impact public health in important ways by enhancing our basic understanding of protein behavior and by facilitating a more efficient selection of protein targets for drug design.      The overall goal is to improve a wide range of protein modeling approaches, both by developing new approaches and by combining those previously been developed. The specific aims are to: (1) improve existing comparative (homology) modeling and (2) improve models obtained by fold recognition and ab initio procedures to make them useful for molecular replacement. There will be some new methods development. Efforts are in four areas--databases, interaction potentials, conformational sampling, and optimization for combining approaches. We will develop ways to include constraints mined from sub-atomic resolution protein structures using a new HIRES database (to include structures with resolution <0.85 A). These will include a structure fragment database, as well as short-range distance distributions. These data can be used to compare modeled structures against the collected data. Uses of the high resolution data will include selecting higher quality fragments to replace poor quality segments in the models, for mining interaction potentials, and as a source of a variety of other high quality information regarding protein structures.       Better assessments of protein structural models will be developed, including the assessment of the quality of individual segments within a protein structure; the new metrics developed will be used for assessing the quality of computer-built models, crystal structures and NMR structures, and provide indicators of the expected quality of whole protein models as well as of their segments. New ways to sample protein motions will be pursued. Combining diverse methods will lead to significant gains in the computer modeling of protein structures.

"Computational Methods for Directed Functional Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational prediction of gene function (or phenotype) can reduce the scale of an experimental problem by focusing attention on a subset of possible experiments. Current function annotation databases-e.g., the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) annotation of genes with Gene Ontology (GO) functions-are critically important resources, but were not designed to host computational predictions Although SGD and several other annotation databases label predictions as such, they provide no measures of confidence. The need exists for quantitative predictions, as distinct from qualitative ""somebody said so"" predictions. Probabilistic scoring systems, in which the score communicates the probability of veracity, are likely to be the most useful.  We will generate probabilistic predictions by developing probabilistic models for predicting function and phenotype. For reasons of data availability, we use S. cerevisiae and C. elegans as model systems.  We will also generate probabilistic models to predict protein and genetic interactions. We will exploit probabilistic networks of protein and genetic interaction in several ways. We will apply ideas from communication theory (2-terminal network reliability) to predict new members of protein complexes from probabilistic protein networks. We will develop computational methods to guide efficient discovery of genetic interactions in S. cerevisiae, as a model for guiding future high-throughput studies in metazoans. We will exploit probabilistic synthetic lethal interaction networks to identify drug mechanism of action.  We will disseminate predictions to the broader biomedical community. We propose a distributed quantitative prediction resource inspired by the DAS system of distributed genome annotation. We will adapt previously developed interfaces for browsing, searching, and retrieving probabilistic annotations to enhance their utility.  In Aim 1. we develop, apply, and validate methods for predicting function, phenotype, physical and genetic interaction in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans.  In Aim 2. we exploit probabilistic networks of protein and genetic interaction in S. cerevisiae to elucidate network structure, to guide functional genomic experiments, and to reveal drug mechanism of action.

"Automated Distant Homology Modeling Meta-server    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to facilitate post-genomic era research by creating a protein structure prediction meta-server for close and distant homology modeling (HM). The proposed meta-server will be a fully automated, fast, widely available, autonomous, multi-component system, aimed at significantly increasing the number of proteins that can be characterized in-silico using current methods. Currently, successful distant HM requires considerable human expertise, including the manual detection and selection of templates and of sequence-template alignments using various fold-recognition (FR) methods, the adjustment of alignments and the refinement, evaluation and selection of alternative models. We aim at automating this process, using state-of-the-art FR meta-prediction technology. We propose 5 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the performance of various top-of-the-line, autonomous FR methods in order to identify the most accurate ones; 2) Develop improved algorithms to generate more accurate FR hybrid models and to better select FR- generated sequence-template alignments; 3) Develop improved methodologies to integrate the information from the FR models and/or the selected alignments to obtain more accurate refined full-atom models; 4) Test, optimize and implement all external software in-house; and 5) Apply the meta-server to specific problems of biological, experimental interest. From the users' perspective this meta-system will facilitate accomplishing one of the goals of Structural Genomics projects, namely, to better exploit the structural information from the experimentally solved proteins in order to obtain relatively accurate computational models for the majority of the remaining proteins, including those at close and those at distant HM distances.

"Computational methods for the analysis of protein flexibility.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein flexibility, manifested by local and global changes in conformation, is an essential component of protein function. Conformational flexibility is involved in fundamental biological activities, such as intermolecular interactions, and in a variety of human diseases, such as transmissible encephalopathies and synucleinopathies. Our long-term goal is to incorporate the dynamic properties of proteins into computational analyses of functional sites and disease-related conformational transitions. However, progress in the important area of protein flexibility has long been hampered by the absence of reliable and efficient computational methodology that could be used to perform systematic large-scale studies of flexible protein segments. The main goal of this proposal is to circumvent this problem by developing accurate high-throughput computational methods for predicting dynamic properties of protein segments using their sequence properties. Protein flexibility can be classified into two broad categories: (1) disordered flexibility observed in disordered segments that completely lack detectable structure and (2) ordered flexibility observed in segments that undergo conformational transition from one detectable ordered structure to another. We will address the least studied category of ordered flexibility. First, we will use a combination of supervised pattern-recognition and statistical methods to develop high-throughput methodology that can be used to quantify and predict ordered conformational flexibility from local sequence and has a low rate of false positive predictions.

"Recognizing protein folds with discriminative learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One (1) of the fundamental problems in computational biology is the prediction of a protein's 3D structural class -- that is, recognition of its fold  from its linear sequence of amino acids. The proposed project aims to develop computational methods and tools for recognizing protein folds. The first specific aim involves building and delivering to the scientific community a web-based, discriminative fold-recognition software engine. This tool will instantiate for the first time in a user-friendly form a discriminative fold-recognition algorithm. This type of algorithm has been described and repeatedly validated in the scientific literature over the past 5 years, but no easy-to-use software tools yet exists to bring this technology to the end user. The second specific aim improves upon existing fold-recognition algorithms by exploiting the inherently multiclass nature of the problem. Previous approaches have treated each fold class independently, thereby sacrificing statistical power. This project will produce algorithms and software that dramatically improve our ability to recognize, from the primary amino acid sequence, subtle structural similarities among proteins.         n/a",Recognizing protein folds with discriminative learning,7228212,R01GM074257,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arts', 'Benchmarking', 'Blast Cell', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Homologous Gene', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Protein Databases', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'improved', 'markov model', 'next generation', 'protein folding', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RES,R01,2007,298241,0.06626789720868004
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells. Experience gained in the course of these studies will be used to direct and refine hardware and software development.           n/a",FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY,7163551,R01GM060678,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Centromere', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosome Segregation', 'Chromosomes', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Fiber', 'Fluorescence', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Kinetochores', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microfilaments', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microtubule Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Plus End of the Microtubule', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tubulin', 'Writing', 'Xenopus', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'charge coupled device camera', 'depolymerization', 'egg', 'experience', 'fluorophore', 'in vitro Assay', 'interest', 'numb protein', 'polymerization', 'programs', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'software development', 'tissue/cell culture']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2007,475153,0.04095178650715706
"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences. In so doing, this work addresses a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in ""post-genomic biology"": linking massive and exponentially growing amounts of raw sequence and structure data to the molecular basis of biological function.           n/a",Comparative genomics of protein structure and function,7192957,R01GM079656,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzymes', 'Failure', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'PAWR protein', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pliability', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Solvents', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'conformer', 'design', 'falls', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2007,290844,0.1129649199482034
"Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The difference between the number of proteins with known sequence and those with well- studied function (sequence-function gap) is growing daily. One well-defined coarse-grained aspect of function is the native subcellular localization of a protein that has a central role in the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. Many detailed and high-throughput experiments annotate localization. Where experiments do not reach, homology-based and de novo prediction methods succeed. Here, we propose the development of a comprehensive system that combines experimental resources with data mining techniques and novel prediction methods with the objective to annotate localization for entirely sequenced eukaryotes at an unprecedented detail and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to gather all available data and all relevant methods to build a comprehensive localization atlas for human and Arabidopsis. Secondly, we plan to develop novel methods tailored specifically to capture proteins for which we are left with no reliable annotations after completing the first step. We assume that these methods will focus on the prediction of the particular type of membrane into which an integral membrane protein is inserted, and of the native localization for minor eukaryotic compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome). Thirdly, we propose the implementation of specific improvements over today's motif-based methods for secreted and nuclear proteins, as well as the extension of de novo predictions for the major compartments. An important objective will be to maintain high levels of performance for splice variants and for sequence fragments. Overall, the project will require the analysis of existing biological databases, the development of novel methods, and the combination of existing ones; it will generate novel information available through internet servers, standalone programs and databases.      RELEVANCE: The annotations generated by our system will aid the design of detailed and high-throughput experimental studies. In particular, localization may increase in its relevance as one essential feature used to infer networks of interactions. The ultimate goal of our project is the generation of an atlas that maps all proteins in a cell. Eventually, this atlas will constitute a 4D map; it will localize proteins in their 3D cellular environments and resolve the coarse-grained dynamics of the system, e.g. ""expression on ribosomes, bind importin, transport into nucleus, bind DNA, bind exportin, export out of nucleus; next cell cycle"". The components proposed here constitute one crucial building block toward such a 4D map of a cell.          n/a",Comprehensive annotation of subcellular localization of entire organisms,7342317,R01GM079767,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Transport', 'Biological databases', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cereals', 'Chloroplasts', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Binding', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Fingerprint', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Internet', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Left', 'Locales', 'Localized', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Mitochondria', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Localization Signal', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Today', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'numb protein', 'programs', 'protein function', 'research study', 'software systems', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,294337,0.09309420916802509
"Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amino acid mutations in human proteins are often associated with inherited predispositions to specific diseases. Yet most observed missense polymorphisms, those involving a single nucleotide change leading to a changed amino acid, have not been characterized in terms of their effects on protein structure and function. We hypothesize that many of the most deleterious missense mutations affect protein function in one of two ways: 1) by altering interaction of proteins with other molecules, including other proteins, DMA, and small ligands; or 2) by altering stability of the protein. Both of these mechanisms depend primarily on the location of the mutation and its physical properties: changes in protein interactions are usually caused by mutations in or very near to a binding site; changes in stability are usually caused by mutations of buried hydrophobic residues. The aim of this proposal is to develop a computational system for predicting the functional effects of missense mutations through homology modeling of protein complexes. New functional data on 1000 random mutations in two dimeric enzyme systems will be obtained to train and test the model. The primary application of this computational system will be to genes associated with the development of   cancer. Cancer is usually linked to a number of genetic changes, some inherited and others somatic. These include loss of DNA-damage repair, breakdown of cell-cycle checkpoints, and resistance to apoptosis. Each of these processes requires many protein interactions, often in large protein complexes. These interactions may be compromised by missense mutations that alter individual interactions between molecules or mutations that lower protein stability.    n/a",Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations,7189836,R01GM073784,"['Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Apoptosis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Genome Anatomy Project', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystathionine beta-Synthase', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'HIV Protease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Ions', 'Lac Repressors', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH)', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Muramidase', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'dimer', 'graphical user interface', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'monomer', 'open source', 'physical property', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R01,2007,307176,0.09845190344517575
"2007 Small Intergin Binding Proteins Gordon Research Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Large, integrin-binding proteins such as collagens, fibronectin, and thrombospondin are integral parts of established matrices and are generally discussed at other GRC meetings. Smaller integrin-binding proteins perform many functions other than those of structural scaffolding. One class of small, integrin-binding proteins encoded by five genes clustered on human chromosome 4 are called the SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein) family. Members include bone sialoprotein, dentin matrix protein, dentin sialophosphoprotein, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, and osteopontin. Normally expressed by skeletal tissue, SIBLINGs are thought to play a role in mineralization as well as cellular adhesion and migration. Specific SIBLINGs are also induced in a number of different cancer types including breast, colon, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and thyroid cancers. Individual SIBLING family members have been found to promote angiogenesis and invasiveness. A second small integrinbinding gene family is the connective tissue growth factor/cysteine-rich 61/nephroblastoma overexpressed (CCN) family of proteins. Members of the CNN family contain a conserved insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein motif and are secreted extracellular matrix proteins. CCNs are involved in diverse biological processes such as regulation of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival. They play important roles in pregnancy, development, angiogenesis, wound repair and inflammation. Certain CCN genes appear to act as tumor-promoting factors, while other CCNs exhibits suppressive capabilities. The focus of this Gordon Research Conference is on defining state-of-the-art knowledge of the biological activities, biochemical interactions and physiological consequences of small-integrin binding proteins in normal and pathological states. This application has as its specific aims to: (1) Convene an international group of experts on SIBLING and CCN biology; (2) Through multidisciplinary presentations determine the state of the art knowledge on small integrin binding proteins in normal physiological function and cancer pathology; (3) Facilitate cross-fertilization of multiple fields (biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, oncology, inflammation, the SIBLING and CCN fields); and (4) spark translational opportunities in the development of novel ways to use SIBLINGs/CCNs as markers for pathological states and discuss therapeutic applications. These aims are directly relevant to the mission of the NIH. The format follows the standard template for a Gordon Research Conference, with an evening introductory evening session, followed by 4 days of morning sessions, late afternoon poster sessions and evening talks in an environment facilitating the open, unhampered discussion of ideas at the frontiers of science. The principal topics to be addressed are: intracellular processing and function of SIBLINGs/CCNs; genetic regulation of SIBLING and CCN genes; SIBLINGs and CCNs in cancer and inflammation; and bioactive fragments of SIBLINGs/CCNs.              n/a",2007 Small Intergin Binding Proteins Gordon Research Conference,7329283,R13HL090059,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Arts', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Class', 'Collagen', 'Colon', 'Cysteine', 'DSPP gene', 'Dentin', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fertilization', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Genus Cola', 'Glycoproteins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin-Like Growth-Factor-Binding Proteins', 'Integrin Binding', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Mission', 'Molecular Biology', 'NOV gene', 'Nephroblastoma', 'Numbers', 'Pancreas', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Siblings', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wound Healing', 'angiogenesis', 'bone sialoprotein', 'cancer type', 'connective tissue growth factor', 'day', 'frontier', 'member', 'migration', 'mineralization', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oncology', 'osteopontin', 'posters', 'scaffold', 'symposium', 'tumor']",NHLBI,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2007,5000,0.06671604483925671
"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.

"Machine Learning and Visualization in Structural Biology    DESCRIPTION:       This project's main objective is to develop computerized tools that assist x-ray crystallographers in rapidly determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein. More specifically, this project addresses the following task: given a 3D electron-density map from crystallography and the sequence of the protein, find the most likely layout (i.e. ""trace"") of the protein sequence in 3D. The project will create both automated methods based on statistical machine-learning and computer-vision techniques, as well as visualization tools that support humans doing this layout. These two approaches complement each other and are synergistic.      This project's first specific aim is to develop and empirically evaluate algorithms that interpret crystallographic electron-density maps. The second specific aim is to incorporate structural-biology domain knowledge (secondary-structure prediction and potential-energy calculations) into the project's algorithms for interpreting density maps. The third specific aim is to tightly integrate partial model-construction with phase estimation updates to improve the recognition of 3D protein structures in x-ray reflection data; crystallographers will be able to intervene whenever they desire to help ""steer"" this iterative process. The final specific aim is to develop intuitive and effective modalities - including virtual reality and the use of speech/audio - for the efficient use of crystallographer's time in manual model fitting and validation.      Structural biology has wide relevance to biomedicine, since protein function generally follows from protein form (i.e., its structure). This project's techniques will speed-up the process of determining protein 3D structures, especially from low-quality (i.e., low-resolution) x-ray data, and will be applicable to other structural-biology tasks.

"Comparison of Protein Sequences and Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goals of our research are: (a) to develop more sensitive and reliable methods for exploiting sequence and structure information through similarity searching; and (b) to understand better the biophysical constraints on protein folding that can be identified from protein sequence information. Although similarity searching is now routinely used to characterize sequences and annotate genomes, the most widely used methods focus on speed at the expense of sensitivity and statistical accuracy. We believe that more flexible algorithms, with more accurate statistical estimates, can provide new biological insights about the structure, function, and evolutionary history of protein and DMA sequences. Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To improve the FASTA programs by: providing better performance on parallel (Beowulf) clusters; using vector-parallel instruction sets, and providing more accurate statistics. (2) To develop evolutionary calibrated DMA sequence comparison algorithms using rapid initial seeding, followed by extension using context dependent scoring matrices. The goal is to develop heuristic approaches with well understood evolutionary horizons. (3) To develop improved strategies for identifying repeated sequences in proteins by combining optimal local alignment strategies with appropriate scoring matrices and gap penalties, (4) To develop accurate statistical estimates for profile: sequence and profile: profile similarity searches. Profile: profile comparison programs with accurate statistical estimates should substantially reduce the sensitivity gap between sequence and structure comparison. Profile: profile comparisons will both be far more useful, and allow us to explore fundamental questions about how easy it is for new protein families to emerge. (5) We will examine local sequence constraints in proteins, using each family as an independent observation. We believe that much of the literature on the global properties of protein sequences fails to distinguish between correlations that reflect genuine biophysical constraints, and correlations that reflect shared evolutionary history. We will also search for clear examples of convergent evolution-similar functions carried out by clearly non-homologous proteins. Accurate statistical estimates for searches with real protein sequences, and profiles from real protein families, can change fundamentally the inference of homology from statistically significant similarity. Because of inaccurate statistical estimates, similarity searching is often considered a tool for generating hypotheses about homology, which must be confirmed experimentally. When the statistical estimates are highly accurate, it may become possible to define homology in terms of statistically significant similarity.           n/a",Comparison of Protein Sequences and Structures,7096765,R01LM004969,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemical evolution', 'chemical information system', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R01,2006,333081,0.0933811154564663
"Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   PredictProtein (PP) was the first Internet server for protein structure prediction when it went online  in 1992 at EMBL. Ever since it has also been the most widely used structure prediction server. Since 1999, PredictProtein runs without financial public support at Columbia University. Limited  CPU resources, prevent us from applying the best current methods; limited human resources  prevent us from making the results more readily available to molecular biologists. PP differs from most other resources in two ways. Firstly, it tries merging a variety of tools into one single report.   Secondly, a number of methods are unique to PP, e.g. the PHD and PROF methods for predictions of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and transmembrane helices.  Here, we propose a variety of technical and scientific solutions improving the functionality of PredictProtein. (1) The technical solutions address job and data handling, database update, user interface, web page layout, presentation of results, and directly linking original resources. (2) The systematic combination of methods requires evaluating these in parallel on identical tasks, e.g., at which level of probability should a signal peptide prediction override the membrane prediction. Our major focus will be on improving predictions for membrane helical proteins, developing methods predicting beta-membrane proteins, and on using structure predictions to more accurately infer functional information. Improving membrane predictions has become particularly urgent, since the recently solved high-resolution structures revealed that all existing methods were over-estimated. We hope that a combination of existing and new methods and a refinement of the respective alignments used will considerably improve prediction accuracy. To predict beta-membrane proteins, we want to explore a combination of novel prediction methods based on neural networks and similar systems with a Markovian-like model that implements the observed grammar in these proteins. As a particular example for using structural information to improve the reliability of inferring function, we propose to investigate the conservation of enzymatic activity.         n/a",Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein,7061743,R01LM007329,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'enzyme activity', 'informatics', 'information systems', 'membrane proteins', 'protein signal sequence', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,290513,0.09492955976236767
"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive.

"Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome project and related genome projects have stirred great hopes for improving our understanding and treatment of diseases. Central to this process is the automated detection of functional motifs and classification of protein sequences into families and/or subfamilies. Conventional approaches for protein sequence classification usually employ sequence alignment methods; other methods depend on the choice of the features included in the training sets, and on accuracy and availability of data. We propose an alignment-independent classification approach based on a search engine technology that had been successfully used in classifying medical records. Each protein is represented by a multidimensional vector, the elements of which refer to the protein's most discriminative eta-grams (sequences of eta amino acids). Preliminary studies on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed that a simple Naive Bayes classifier using straightforward eta-gram feature   selection in its preprocessing, can outperform existing classifiers including support vector machines on previously investigated, standardized GPCR sequence data subsets. Jackknife tests applied to the Protein Information Resource (PIR) Protein Sequence Database PSD and to the Pfam database (DB) of protein families showed that approximately 70% of the protein sequences are classified correctly.  More significantly, the most discriminative eta-grams in a given protein family appear to have a functional or structural role, as suggested by their comparison with the sequence motifs known to be conserved or active in existing DBs and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of representative members of the family.

"Bioinformatics approaches to characterizing amino acid function.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying residues of importance in the protein products of genes is a challenging and important problem for informatics, genome annotation, molecular biology, biochemistry and drug discovery. Functional annotation of genes is inherently hierarchical; genes can be annotated at the level of genome sequence, transcript variant, protein product, protein domain, nucleotide or amino acid. Only a few resources annotate protein function at the level of the amino acid and language relating residue function and gene product sequence, structure and expression is challenging. To address this, I am investigating how sequence, evolutionary and structural descriptors can be used to quantify function. I am applying this knowledge to develop methods that can associate residues with known functional annotations, perform annotation transfer onto an experimentally determined or modeled protein structure, and determine the likely molecular effects of mutation, thus creating a framework for residue annotation. One of the greatest challenges for the computational biologist is identifying features (or attributes) that are useful for classification of genomic data. With this effort, we will continue our work describing novel features for classification of functional sites and we will test them using supervised machine learning tools. We will do this by, 1) testing the power of several diverse functional features for classification of catalytic residues in proteins, 2) applying these features to other important residue functional annotation problems, and 3) evaluate features based on homologous sequences. This research is important for understanding the molecular basis of diseases such as cancer and pharmacogenetics data from a molecular perspective. When completed, scientists will have a rich set of data and tools for basic health research.             n/a",Bioinformatics approaches to characterizing amino acid function.,7079558,K22LM009135,"['bioinformatics', 'classification', 'gene mutation', 'genes', 'genome', 'learning', 'model', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'proteins']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K22,2006,152164,0.08267390146700325
"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.

"Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein structure prediction is one of the great challenges in structural biology. The ability to accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins would bring about significant scientific advances and would facilitate finding cures and treatments for many diseases. We propose a novel computational framework for protein structure prediction. The novelty of the framework lies in its approach to conformation space search. Conformation space search is considered to be the primary bottleneck towards consistent, high-resolution prediction. The proposed approach to conformation space search represents a major conceptual shift in protein structure prediction, made possible by combining insights and algorithms from robotics and machine learning with techniques from molecular biology in an innovative manner. The key innovation comes from the insight that target-specific information can effectively guide conformation space search towards biologically relevant regions. We propose to develop a framework for protein structure prediction that achieves biological accuracy and computational efficiency by guiding conformation space search using target-specific information. The proposed framework exploits two sources of target-specific information: 1) information about the characteristics of the target's energy landscape acquired continuously during search, and 2) spatial restraints about the target's structure obtained from NMR experiments. As search progresses, the continuous integration of these sources of information will tailor conformation space search to the particular characteristics of the target. This tailored conformation space exploration can overcome the current bottleneck, yielding highly accurate and efficient structure prediction. The ability to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, which represent the molecular machinery inside every cell, would greatly facilitate finding cures or treatments for many diseases. This research effort will develop of a novel, efficient, and biologically accurate computational approach to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins.           n/a",Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search,7139225,R01GM076706,"['bioinformatics', 'chemical models', 'chemical structure', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'conformation', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'structural biology', 'three dimensional imaging /topography']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2006,238087,0.10672789050011312
"Integration and analysis tools for protein interaction networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing size and diversity of biological databases has necessitated the design of new scalable tools that can search across multiple databases and integrate information from multiple data sources. We propose to develop software for integrating and understanding protein-protein interactions, a fundamental problem in biology. A set of tools will be developed for constructing large-scale probabilistic networks of protein interactions using data sources such as microarrays, bioimages, GO annotations, genomic data, literature, and experimental data. The techniques will be based on Bayesian networks (BN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and will be made scalable to large datasets. The second goal is to develop tools for analyzing interaction networks for pathway discovery, motif finding, and function identification. These tools will be based on current research in the areas of graph algorithms, bioinformatics, machine learning, and databases. We will target two model organisms: S. cerevisiae (yeast) and C. elegans (worm). The quality of the constructed networks will be evaluated with known protein interactions for these species. Scalability tests will be performed with the worm interactome that is about ten times larger than the yeast interactome. The developed tools will be compatible with current standards and integrated into a database backend. The resulting software will enable assimilation of heterogeneous biological data with the ultimate goal of increased understanding of fundamental processes in molecular biology. The goal of this Phase I project is to prove the feasibility of constructing and analyzing probabilistic protein interaction networks in a scalable manner using new algorithms. The integration of diverse data sources such as microarrays, genomics, literature, and high-throughput experiments into pathways will facilitate the study the biological processes behind human diseases. The understanding of protein interactions within a pathway and interactions between pathways will lead to the selection of appropriate targets for therapeutic intervention, and eventually to cheaper and faster drug discovery.             n/a",Integration and analysis tools for protein interaction networks,7155257,R43RR022659,"['information systems', 'model', 'protein protein interaction', 'proteins']",NCRR,"ACELOT, INC.",R43,2006,199950,0.05431585902933398
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells.

"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.

"A Bioinformatic Approach to Inferring Protein Contacts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to the increased awareness for Bio-defense and the possibility of the spread of new emerging infectious pathogens, I propose to investigate the feasibility of predicting amino acid contacts for the three proteins of the replication/transcription complex of the order Mononegavirales (e.g. Ebola, Rabies, measles etc.). The large size of the replication/transcription complex is beyond the limits of current structural determination methods such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy; therefore, an approach that correlates results from both laboratory and Bio-informatic analyses is a logical course of action. The proposed Bio-informatic studies will proceed along three paths: prediction of disorder; determination of compensatory mutation; and assessment of evolutionary dynamics. Correlating the data obtained from these methods and experimental data from the published literature will maximize the chances of identifying the protein: protein contact points both within and between the P, N, and L proteins of the replication/transcription complex. However, this poses the challenge of integrating the findings from the different methods in a meaningful and comprehensive way. A traditional joint probability distribution approach would require a space of O(2^n) to represent the data, with n being the number of data sets. Given the vast amount of information to be incorporated, this method is beyond current computational feasibility. Instead, a method from the field of artificial intelligence, Bayesian Networks (also known as Belief Networks) will be utilized to correlate the results.

"Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   PredictProtein (PP) was the first Internet server for protein structure prediction when it went online  in 1992 at EMBL. Ever since it has also been the most widely used structure prediction server. Since 1999, PredictProtein runs without financial public support at Columbia University. Limited  CPU resources, prevent us from applying the best current methods; limited human resources  prevent us from making the results more readily available to molecular biologists. PP differs from most other resources in two ways. Firstly, it tries merging a variety of tools into one single report.   Secondly, a number of methods are unique to PP, e.g. the PHD and PROF methods for predictions of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and transmembrane helices.  Here, we propose a variety of technical and scientific solutions improving the functionality of PredictProtein. (1) The technical solutions address job and data handling, database update, user interface, web page layout, presentation of results, and directly linking original resources. (2) The systematic combination of methods requires evaluating these in parallel on identical tasks, e.g., at which level of probability should a signal peptide prediction override the membrane prediction. Our major focus will be on improving predictions for membrane helical proteins, developing methods predicting beta-membrane proteins, and on using structure predictions to more accurately infer functional information. Improving membrane predictions has become particularly urgent, since the recently solved high-resolution structures revealed that all existing methods were over-estimated. We hope that a combination of existing and new methods and a refinement of the respective alignments used will considerably improve prediction accuracy. To predict beta-membrane proteins, we want to explore a combination of novel prediction methods based on neural networks and similar systems with a Markovian-like model that implements the observed grammar in these proteins. As a particular example for using structural information to improve the reliability of inferring function, we propose to investigate the conservation of enzymatic activity.         n/a",Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein,6890051,R01LM007329,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'enzyme activity', 'informatics', 'information systems', 'membrane proteins', 'protein signal sequence', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,296993,0.09492955976236767
"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive.

Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells.

"A Bioinformatic Approach to Inferring Protein Contacts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to the increased awareness for Bio-defense and the possibility of the spread of new emerging infectious pathogens, I propose to investigate the feasibility of predicting amino acid contacts for the three proteins of the replication/transcription complex of the order Mononegavirales (e.g. Ebola, Rabies, measles etc.). The large size of the replication/transcription complex is beyond the limits of current structural determination methods such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy; therefore, an approach that correlates results from both laboratory and Bio-informatic analyses is a logical course of action. The proposed Bio-informatic studies will proceed along three paths: prediction of disorder; determination of compensatory mutation; and assessment of evolutionary dynamics. Correlating the data obtained from these methods and experimental data from the published literature will maximize the chances of identifying the protein: protein contact points both within and between the P, N, and L proteins of the replication/transcription complex. However, this poses the challenge of integrating the findings from the different methods in a meaningful and comprehensive way. A traditional joint probability distribution approach would require a space of O(2^n) to represent the data, with n being the number of data sets. Given the vast amount of information to be incorporated, this method is beyond current computational feasibility. Instead, a method from the field of artificial intelligence, Bayesian Networks (also known as Belief Networks) will be utilized to correlate the results. Several experimental laboratories have agreed to test the residue contact predictions resulting from these studies for Ebola, VSV and measles. n/a",A Bioinformatic Approach to Inferring Protein Contacts,6814915,R21AI063510,"['Mononegavirales', 'artificial intelligence', 'biochemical evolution', 'bioinformatics', 'biotechnology', 'computational biology', 'gene mutation', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein sequence', 'proteomics', 'virus protein']",NIAID,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY (BOZEMAN),R21,2004,203950,0.06746991543618848

"Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   PredictProtein (PP) was the first Internet server for protein structure prediction when it went online  in 1992 at EMBL. Ever since it has also been the most widely used structure prediction server. Since 1999, PredictProtein runs without financial public support at Columbia University. Limited  CPU resources, prevent us from applying the best current methods; limited human resources  prevent us from making the results more readily available to molecular biologists. PP differs from most other resources in two ways. Firstly, it tries merging a variety of tools into one single report.   Secondly, a number of methods are unique to PP, e.g. the PHD and PROF methods for predictions of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and transmembrane helices.  Here, we propose a variety of technical and scientific solutions improving the functionality of PredictProtein. (1) The technical solutions address job and data handling, database update, user interface, web page layout, presentation of results, and directly linking original resources. (2) The systematic combination of methods requires evaluating these in parallel on identical tasks, e.g., at which level of probability should a signal peptide prediction override the membrane prediction. Our major focus will be on improving predictions for membrane helical proteins, developing methods predicting beta-membrane proteins, and on using structure predictions to more accurately infer functional information. Improving membrane predictions has become particularly urgent, since the recently solved high-resolution structures revealed that all existing methods were over-estimated. We hope that a combination of existing and new methods and a refinement of the respective alignments used will considerably improve prediction accuracy. To predict beta-membrane proteins, we want to explore a combination of novel prediction methods based on neural networks and similar systems with a Markovian-like model that implements the observed grammar in these proteins. As a particular example for using structural information to improve the reliability of inferring function, we propose to investigate the conservation of enzymatic activity.         n/a",Improve predictions of structure/function by Protein,6744087,R01LM007329,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'enzyme activity', 'informatics', 'information systems', 'membrane proteins', 'protein signal sequence', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,343133,0.09492955976236767
"PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central challenge in bioinformatics today is developing computational methods for predicting a protein's structure, function, and biologically relevant partners at the whole-genome level. The first two problems are well-studied, but research on determining partners for given protein sequences is just beginning. The long-term goal is to create an automated system for predicting protein-protein interactions at the whole-genome level. This proposal focuses on the coiled coil motif, whose regular and repeating structure makes it an ideal model for computational detection. Also, advances in predicting coiled coil formation have important biological and medical consequences, since the coiled coil is widespread in sequence databases (3-5%), appearing in proteins that participate in transcription, oncogenesis, cell structure, and cell fusion events. The proposed method combines experimental data, coiled coil sequence information, and statistical information from protein sequences and 3-D structures to determine partner specificity between individual helices. The method is general enough to be extended to other protein domains and thus predict other protein-protein interactions and extract functional information.   n/a",PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES,6908827,F31GM066377,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer simulation', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'molecular biology information system', 'predoctoral investigator', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein sequence', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F31,2004,18979,0.12217227574105705
"EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION The goal of this project is to develop a computer algorithm that accurately predicts the tertiary fold of a protein given only its amino acid sequence and sparse experimental constraints or an imperfect secondary structure prediction. It will use an evolutionary optimization algorithm, a detailed atomic representation, and a proprietary method for deriving a protein energy function. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) improve the representation of the problem; (2) improve the optimization algorithm; (3) parameterize a more accurate protein energy function; and (4) validate the prototype algorithm and energy function on a large sample of known protein structures and in blind structure prediction experiments. In Phase III the algorithm will be developed into commercial software products for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  The long-term goal is to help satisfy the rapidly growing demand for the accurate prediction of protein structures from sequence information. This demand arises not only from the exponential growth of the database of sequences, but also from the need to understand the structure and function of newly discovered gene products known to be involved in human disease.

"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive. The reasons for this are several: 1)                 insufficient benchmarking of most prediction methods; 2) reliance on                 out-of-date statistical analysis of protein structures, performed without modem      methods of statistics: 3) most modeling methods assume a relatively high level       of sequence identity (>35 percent) between template structure and sequence to        be modeled, when most proteins of unknown structure are only distantly related       to proteins of known structure. The PI proposes benchmarking, new statistical        analysis, and new algorithms for each of the three major aspects of homology         modeling: alignment, building backbone coordinates for insertiondeletion             regions, and sidechain placement. The primary tools will be Bayesian                 statistical analysis, including hierarchical models and non-parametric methods       based on the Dirichlet process. The increase in size of the sequence and             structure databases makes the new statistical analysis timely, both because of       the increased power the new data provide, and the numerous applications              afforded by more sequences and structures.                                                                                                                                n/a",Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling,6683607,R01HG002302,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer simulation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'statistics /biometry', 'transposon /insertion element']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R01,2004,252000,0.14173288576104104
"Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome project and related genome projects have stirred great hopes for improving our understanding and treatment of diseases. Central to this process is the automated detection of functional motifs and classification of protein sequences into families and/or subfamilies. Conventional approaches for protein sequence classification usually employ sequence alignment methods; other methods depend on the choice of the features included in the training sets, and on accuracy and availability of data. We propose an alignment-independent classification approach based on a search engine technology that had been successfully used in classifying medical records. Each protein is represented by a multidimensional vector, the elements of which refer to the protein's most discriminative eta-grams (sequences of eta amino acids). Preliminary studies on G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) showed that a simple Naive Bayes classifier using straightforward eta-gram feature   selection in its preprocessing, can outperform existing classifiers including support vector machines on previously investigated, standardized GPCR sequence data subsets. Jackknife tests applied to the Protein Information Resource (PIR) Protein Sequence Database PSD and to the Pfam database (DB) of protein families showed that approximately 70% of the protein sequences are classified correctly.  More significantly, the most discriminative eta-grams in a given protein family appear to have a functional or structural role, as suggested by their comparison with the sequence motifs known to be conserved or active in existing DBs and by the examination of the three-dimensional structure of representative members of the family. Encouraged by these results, we propose to pursue the following specific aims:   (1) develop a new computational tool for protein sequence analysis and protein classification based on eta-gram distributions, (2) build a comprehensive DB of protein families based on eta-gram distributions and investigate the relationships between this DB and the leading protein classification DBs, (3) determine the functional significance of the top-ranking n-grams, and (4) develop a Java based toolkit that will provide easy-to-use, yet flexible, web interface to researchers from various background. The expected deliverables are the methodology and software for classification without alignment (CWA); a new database of classified proteins, based on CWA; and an on-line server and GUI that will deliver the database and data mining tools to the scientific community in a user-friendly environment.         n/a",Alignment-independent Classification of Proteins,6777359,R01LM007994,"['Internet', 'classification', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular probes', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein purification', 'protein sequence', 'protein structure function', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2004,278711,0.13565230360916417
"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.

"NMR TECHNOLOGY FOR STRUCTURAL GENOMICS OF BREAST CANCER Genomics research is providing unprecedented access to expression vectors for thousands of proteins and it is critical to develop faster structure-determination technology to discover their cellular roles. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful and widely used method to determine accurate protein structures, but is also time consuming. Progress in understanding eukaryotic mechanisms of replication, transcription and translation depends critically on gaining faster access to structures of domains and proteins identified in human and other genome projects. We propose new technology for fast protein structure determination by solution state NMR. We will develop and demonstrate this technology on the 127 residue bromodomain from yeast Sth1p. Bromodomain has been chosen for its relevance to the regulation of acetylation states of histones in eukaryotic DNA. The BrD stucture will yield insights into its roles in transcription activation and repression protein complexes and should help to clarify the role of acetylation regulation in carcinogenesis. We will transfer this technology to demonstrate high throughput determination of multiple structures associated with breast cancer gene sequences in collaboration with the newly established Harvard Structural Genomics of Cancer Initiative.

"Intelligent Imaging Robot for Structural Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Knowledge of the 3-D structure of proteins is essential for understanding how they function and the designing of drugs to affect those functions. The Structural Genomics Initiative of the NIH aims to solve the 3-D structure of thousands of proteins a year by a major scale up of technology. X-ray crystallography, which requires high-quality protein crystals, is a significant means of deducing 3-D structure. Growing protein crystals is a process of trial and error and, in high-throughput protein crystallization, essential for the Structural Genomics Initiative to succeed, combinatorial methods are used to set up thousands of crystallization vessels in parallel and machine vision robots inspect each vessel for the presence of crystals and crystal-like objects. A bottleneck is the inability of current robots to distinguish between micro crystals and other small, uninteresting objects, necessitating human intervention to make the distinction. In this Phase I SBIR proposal the feasibility of a novel imaging method will be tested. This method appears capable of distinguishing crystalline objects from amorphous ones and protein crystals from uninteresting salt crystals. Once the feasibility is demonstrated, the new method can form the basis of a robot possessing intelligent machine vision. In Phase II a prototype of the robot will be built. There is demand for such a robot among high-throughput laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, contract X-ray crystallography companies and drug discovery firms.

"Predictions of structure/function by PredictProtein DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   PredictProtein (PP) was the first Internet server for protein structure prediction when it went online  in 1992 at EMBL. Ever since it has also been the most widely used structure prediction server. Since 1999, PredictProtein runs without financial public support at Columbia University. Limited  CPU resources, prevent us from applying the best current methods; limited human resources  prevent us from making the results more readily available to molecular biologists. PP differs from most other resources in two ways. Firstly, it tries merging a variety of tools into one single report.   Secondly, a number of methods are unique to PP, e.g. the PHD and PROF methods for predictions of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and transmembrane helices.  Here, we propose a variety of technical and scientific solutions improving the functionality of PredictProtein. (1) The technical solutions address job and data handling, database update, user interface, web page layout, presentation of results, and directly linking original resources. (2) The systematic combination of methods requires evaluating these in parallel on identical tasks, e.g., at which level of probability should a signal peptide prediction override the membrane prediction. Our major focus will be on improving predictions for membrane helical proteins, developing methods predicting beta-membrane proteins, and on using structure predictions to more accurately infer functional information. Improving membrane predictions has become particularly urgent, since the recently solved high-resolution structures revealed that all existing methods were over-estimated. We hope that a combination of existing and new methods and a refinement of the respective alignments used will considerably improve prediction accuracy. To predict beta-membrane proteins, we want to explore a combination of novel prediction methods based on neural networks and similar systems with a Markovian-like model that implements the observed grammar in these proteins. As a particular example for using structural information to improve the reliability of inferring function, we propose to investigate the conservation of enzymatic activity.         n/a",Predictions of structure/function by PredictProtein,6610635,R01LM007329,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' enzyme activity', ' informatics', ' information systems', ' membrane proteins', ' protein signal sequence', ' protein structure', ' protein structure function']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2003,342656,0.08667418809913545
"PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central challenge in bioinformatics today is developing computational methods for predicting a protein's structure, function, and biologically relevant partners at the whole-genome level. The first two problems are well-studied, but research on determining partners for given protein sequences is just beginning. The long-term goal is to create an automated system for predicting protein-protein interactions at the whole-genome level. This proposal focuses on the coiled coil motif, whose regular and repeating structure makes it an ideal model for computational detection. Also, advances in predicting coiled coil formation have important biological and medical consequences, since the coiled coil is widespread in sequence databases (3-5%), appearing in proteins that participate in transcription, oncogenesis, cell structure, and cell fusion events. The proposed method combines experimental data, coiled coil sequence information, and statistical information from protein sequences and 3-D structures to determine partner specificity between individual helices. The method is general enough to be extended to other protein domains and thus predict other protein-protein interactions and extract functional information.   n/a",PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES,6607720,F31GM066377,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer simulation', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' predoctoral investigator', ' protein protein interaction', ' protein sequence', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F31,2003,40616,0.12217227574105705
"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive. The reasons for this are several: 1)                 insufficient benchmarking of most prediction methods; 2) reliance on                 out-of-date statistical analysis of protein structures, performed without modem      methods of statistics: 3) most modeling methods assume a relatively high level       of sequence identity (>35 percent) between template structure and sequence to        be modeled, when most proteins of unknown structure are only distantly related       to proteins of known structure. The PI proposes benchmarking, new statistical        analysis, and new algorithms for each of the three major aspects of homology         modeling: alignment, building backbone coordinates for insertiondeletion             regions, and sidechain placement. The primary tools will be Bayesian                 statistical analysis, including hierarchical models and non-parametric methods       based on the Dirichlet process. The increase in size of the sequence and             structure databases makes the new statistical analysis timely, both because of       the increased power the new data provide, and the numerous applications              afforded by more sequences and structures.                                                                                                                                n/a",Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling,6622146,R01HG002302,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer simulation', ' functional /structural genomics', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' statistics /biometry', ' transposon /insertion element']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R01,2003,252000,0.14173288576104104
"COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary structure.  Deciphering this relationship, the protein folding problem has become increasingly important to molecular biologists.  With the dramatic progress of the genome initiatives within the public and private sector and the push for a structural genomics initiative in the post-genomic era, the need for computational strategies to relate protein sequence to protein structure become even more profound.  This proposal describes new directions in our effort to improve the accuracy of protein secondary structure and to use these results and others to improve the results of threading algorithms that map new sequences onto existing structures.  We continue to be impressed by the information inherent in a family of protein sequences, especially when viewed from an evolutionary perspective.  A study of the ligand binding domain and the corresponding ligands of intranuclear hormone receptors is planned.  This effort will link computation, molecular biology and synthetic chemistry efforts to better understand this pharmacologically exciting group of molecules.  In addition, an evolutionary trace strategy is described that could lead to the identification of pairs of covarying residues within a family of aligned sequences.  Success in this arena would have important implications for threading algorithms.  Finally, work on the design of a novel class of abiologic sturctured heteropolymers is described that builds on our recent results with N-alkylated glycines.  n/a",COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE,6627160,R01GM039900,"['G protein', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' conformation', ' guanosinetriphosphatases', ' high performance liquid chromatography', ' hormone receptor', ' mathematical model', ' physical model', ' protein binding', ' protein folding', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' receptor coupling', ' transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2003,355251,0.1358881191385006
"FUNCTION DIVERGENCE IN PROTEIN FAMILIES The goal of the proposed research is to study functional similarities            and differences between proteins with broadly similar structures, but            no recognizable sequence similarity. Automated structure comparison              programs, together with a new generation of fold prediction algorithms,          provide us with many examples of proteins that do, or are likely to,             belong to the same structural class.  At the same time, such broad               structural similarity may or may not be connected to any functional              similarity.  A database of protein structure and function will be built,         allowing a search for groups of proteins with certain structural and             functional features.  Such groups will then be analyzed to identify              structurally and functionally important regions in the sequence and to           match them with levels of structural and functional similarity/                  divergence.

"Flexible NLP system for MEDLINE information extraction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation and Research Phase I project focuses on the development of the fully automatic system for extraction of the protein function information from MEDLINE abstracts and conversion it into a form of a conceptual graph. All existent protein function databases depend on human experts who cannot keep up with the exponential growth of protein function information freely available in MEDLINE. There is an urgent need for an automatic system capable of extracting protein function information from literature. The system we proposed will be based on advanced natural language processing (NLP) technologies, and uses it as a fast and reliable way to extract information about protein function from human readable sources. To this end, we have developed and tested MedScan - a prototype of such system that parses scientific abstracts and converts protein function information into a form of a conceptual graph. It consists of a preprocessor module selecting candidate sentences from MEDLINE, an NLP module utilizing proprietary linguistic model to parse the selected sentences, and an information extraction module utilizing developed ontology to extract and validate protein function information. The results of MedScan evaluation indicate that it is a feasible candidate for a proposed task. In Phase II, the software system will be developed to assist the researchers to quickly access, search and navigate through the MEDLINE content, and to visualize and analyze the large volumes of protein function data. We will also extend our approach to other areas including pharmacogenomics and extraction of clinically relevant information. n/a",Flexible NLP system for MEDLINE information extraction,6693928,R43GM067276,"['computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' information dissemination', ' information retrieval', ' information systems', ' molecular biology information system', ' protein structure function']",NIGMS,"ARIADNE GENOMICS, INC.",R43,2003,100000,0.051337809611536174
"MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (verbatim from applicant's abstract): The long-term focus of this        research program has been microtubules (MTs) and the mechanisms of their             assembly and function in mitosis, cytokinesis, and motility. Accurate                chromosome segregation depends on the dynamics and polarity of spindle MTs, the      activities of motor proteins associated with MT s, the activities of protein         components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as Mad2p, and the ability of      MTs to direct the plane of cytokinesis for accurate segregation of the               chromosomes. Errors in segregation can induce cancer and developmental defects.      In continuing and expanding on previous research efforts, we will be analyzing       the properties and functions of MTs and associated proteins that are involved        with various aspects of mitosis and cytokinesis. A major strength of our work        has been the development and application of new techniques in quantitative           optical microscopy and dynamic digital imaging of living cells and cytoplasmic       extracts. Here we propose to develop a new digital imaging microscope system         that combines multiwavelength fluorescence, DIC, and fluorescence speckle            microscopy with fluorescence redistribution after laser photobleaching or            photoactivation and laser optical trapping. We also will improve our computer        vision methods for measuring the mechanical and assembly properties of MTs.          This new technology will enable us to analyze the dynamics of kinetochore            protein assembly and function in the recruitment of MTs by kinetochores,             chromosome motility, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint as well as the               molecular mechanisms of MT poleward flux and its function in mitosis. Using          budding yeast genetics and digital imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we will           identify molecular components, including MT motor proteins, that are involved        with the coupling of force generation to the assembly/disassembly of MTs. We         intend to continue investigating the mechanisms of MT dynamic instability and        the biophysical properties of MTs, including the action of anticancer tubulin        drugs. Finally, we will analyze how MT dynamics may be involved in the               regulation of cytokinesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          n/a",MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION,6635816,R01GM024364,"['Urodela', ' Xenopus', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell cycle', ' cell motility', ' centromere', ' chromosome movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system hardware', ' contact inhibition', ' cytoskeletal proteins', ' digital imaging', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' meiosis', ' microtubules', ' mitotic spindle apparatus', ' nanotechnology', ' photoactivation', ' protein binding', ' protein biosynthesis', ' protein structure function', ' technology /technique development', ' tissue /cell culture', ' video microscopy', ' yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2003,347106,0.07374161774052891
"NMR TECHNOLOGY FOR STRUCTURAL GENOMICS OF BREAST CANCER Genomics research is providing unprecedented access to expression vectors for thousands of proteins and it is critical to develop faster structure-determination technology to discover their cellular roles. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful and widely used method to determine accurate protein structures, but is also time consuming. Progress in understanding eukaryotic mechanisms of replication, transcription and translation depends critically on gaining faster access to structures of domains and proteins identified in human and other genome projects. We propose new technology for fast protein structure determination by solution state NMR. We will develop and demonstrate this technology on the 127 residue bromodomain from yeast Sth1p. Bromodomain has been chosen for its relevance to the regulation of acetylation states of histones in eukaryotic DNA. The BrD stucture will yield insights into its roles in transcription activation and repression protein complexes and should help to clarify the role of acetylation regulation in carcinogenesis. We will transfer this technology to demonstrate high throughput determination of multiple structures associated with breast cancer gene sequences in collaboration with the newly established Harvard Structural Genomics of Cancer Initiative. We expect that discovery of new eukaryotic protein structures will lead to a reevaluation of targets identified for drug design and to new directions for cancer studies.  n/a",NMR TECHNOLOGY FOR STRUCTURAL GENOMICS OF BREAST CANCER,6514905,F32CA089940,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasms', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy', ' protein structure', ' transcription factor']",NCI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY (MEDICAL SCHOOL),F32,2002,46192,0.06842781445621297
"COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                                                                                                                  The long-term goal of our research is the development of better methods for          identifying distantly related protein and DNA sequences, and to exploit our          ability to detect distant homologies to explore the duplication, fusion, and         other processes responsible for increases in protein diversity.  Although            similarity searching is now a routine first step in the characterization of          newly determined sequences, we believe that additional improvements in               similarity searching methods will allow investigators to look back more deeply       in evolutionary time.  Moreover, as complete protein sequence sets become            available for more organisms, sequence information can be exploited more             effectively for functional genomics and traditional biochemical problems.  The       availability of complete genome sequences, combined with reliable and                sensitive sequence comparison algorithms, also allows us to test hypotheses          about the possible emergence of novel proteins over the past 200-1,200 million       years.  Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To extend the           average look-back time provided by protein sequence similarity searching.  We        propose improvements to the scoring methods and statistics analysis of               similarity scores that seek to push back the protein similarity-search horizon       from 1.5-2-fold, to more than 2,000 million years for most protein families.         (2) To develop a higher performance, more flexible and user-friendly FASTA           package.  (3) To study repeated domains in proteins.  We will develop more           quantitative methods for identifying both simple sequence and long-period            repeats in proteins.  We will characterize the fraction of repeat-containing         proteins in proteomes, characterize the fraction of domain-structured proteins       that are not internally repetitive, and ask whether these proteins duplicate         or diverge with patterns that differ from ""normal"" single domain proteins.           (4) To explore genome-scale protein evolution and to identify potential              ""novel"" or ""young"" protein families or domains.  Over the next 2-4 years, more       than six genomes that have diverged in the last 400 million years - an               evolutionary distance sufficiently short that we should be able to identify          all protein homologs - will become available.  We will compare complete              genomes searching for newly emergent sequences.

"BIOINFORMATICS, DISORDERED PROTEINS, AND FUNCTION A major objective of bioinformatics is to predict protein structure/function from sequence; the most successful current methods use sequence homology.  These current homology-based methods explicitly or implicitly assume the paradigm sequence yields structure yields function.  Since protein function depends on flexibility, movement, or even lack of structure (disorder) in some cases, combining various motion predictions with structure predictions should improve prediction of function.  Algorithms for predicting flexibility from sequence and local disorder have been developed, as have algorithms to predict sequences that snitch between two structured states.  Sequence complexity might also be an indirect measure of mobility and still other measures could be discovered by the study of known examples.  We propose to determine the interplay of homology-based predictions that use sequence information only with explicit representations of both structure information and motion information as determined from amino acid sequence.  Structural information will be represented by helix, sheet, etc., predictions, and by hydrophobic moment calculations.  Motion information will be represented by flexibility prediction, switch sequence prediction, order / disorder prediction, sequence complexity, and new measures if any are discovered in the course of this work.  Since different functions would involve motional parameters to different extents, the plan is to apply this combined approach on a sequence family basis.  Novel comparisons, called Attribute Profiles, are proposed for the representation of structure and motion information.  Sets of Gribskov/Eisenberg 1D Profiles and associated Attribute Profiles will be combined into single predictions using neural network data models.  Prediction outcomes will be compared with experimental observations and evaluated using the jackknife method.  If successful, this work will improve prediction of protein function from amino acid sequence, which is important given the significant numbers of protein sequences with undetermined functions coming out of the various genome projects.  Motion and disorder are important pieces that need to be added to the characterization of protein structure/function.  For example, taxol has been shown recently to bind to a disordered loop in Bcl-2.  Alzheimer disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Parkinson disease and infectious agents such as Staphylococcal aureus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and (perhaps) HIV depend critically on disordered regions of protein.  Thus, understanding the interplay of sequence, flexibility, order / disorder, complexity, structure and function clearly relates to human health.  n/a","BIOINFORMATICS, DISORDERED PROTEINS, AND FUNCTION",6538213,R01LM006916,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' conformation', ' hydropathy', ' informatics', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' structural biology']",NLM,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,342080,0.09432238731963388

"EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION The goal of this project is to develop a computer algorithm that accurately predicts the tertiary fold of a protein given only its amino acid sequence and sparse experimental constraints or an imperfect secondary structure prediction. It will use an evolutionary optimization algorithm, a detailed atomic representation, and a proprietary method for deriving a protein energy function. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) improve the representation of the problem; (2) improve the optimization algorithm; (3) parameterize a more accurate protein energy function; and (4) validate the prototype algorithm and energy function on a large sample of known protein structures and in blind structure prediction experiments. In Phase III the algorithm will be developed into commercial software products for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  The long-term goal is to help satisfy the rapidly growing demand for the accurate prediction of protein structures from sequence information. This demand arises not only from the exponential growth of the database of sequences, but also from the need to understand the structure and function of newly discovered gene products known to be involved in human disease. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Commercial applications include protein structure determination, structure- based drug design and protein engineering in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and in basic academic research.  n/a",EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION,6386771,R44GM056593,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' conformation', ' intermolecular interaction', ' physical model', ' protein folding', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,TECOLOTE RESEARCH,R44,2002,164180,0.1382071159775155
"Structure based prediction of protein modifications  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genomics revolution has uncovered tens of thousands of proteins, nonetheless full exploitation of organismal genome projects will not occur without innovations in proteomics and structural biology. The agencies meeting this challenge, such as the seven NIH protein structure consortia , have targeted 10,000 new protein structures to be solved by 2010. We propose to use this powerfully enabling structural dataset as the basis for a new type of bioinformatic tool which models and compares the surfaces of proteins, instead of their sequence or backbone path, by analogy to sequence comparison methods. An algorithm that searches a protein's sw-lace features for post-translational modification and binding sites will offer a large step forward. The ability to model protein binding sites will allow investigators to predict how they interact, how regulatory networks are organized, and what determines the order of metabolic pathways--each a fundamental goal of much research. Cognia is well positioned to undertake this effort as we are currently building databases and tools designed to identify drug targets and biotherapeutic candidates for use in both basic research and pharmaceutical-biotech discovery. Our use of predictive tools to analyze, organize, and synthesize the content of databases lends direction to this proposal, and its near-term focus will involve the analysis of post-translational modifications such as the ubiquitylation and SUMOylation accomplished by E3 enzymes during the cell cycle. We anticipate that algorithms developed under this proposal will have many applications, including the ability to (I) predict novel binding interactions of structurally defined proteins (ii) identify structural homologs of proteins not apparent by sequence or backbone similarity searches (iii) define an enzyme's potential substrates, (iv) define structural features of binding sites. In Phase I, we will gather the requisite data and structures and carry out a pilot definition of an E3's consensus binding site. This will provide the foundation for Phase II, where we will create a tool that will scan all known structures for consensi, predicting interactions and modifications.   n/a",Structure based prediction of protein modifications,6551328,R43GM066514,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' posttranslational modifications', ' protein binding', ' protein metabolism', ' protein protein interaction', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,COGNIA CORPORATION,R43,2002,96725,0.09148788654585399
"Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve human health, a goal of the          human genome project is to translate the genome sequence into an understanding       of human biology. An important step in this process is knowledge of the              structure of human proteins and the effects of sequence polymorphisms on             structure and function. Currently, the structures of only 1000 human proteins        are known, but the structures of up to one third or so of human proteins can be      modeled based on the structures of homologous proteins in the Protein Data           Bank. This fraction will increase rapidly due to structural genomics efforts.        Unfortunately, general principles of what works in homology modeling and what        does not have remained elusive. The reasons for this are several: 1)                 insufficient benchmarking of most prediction methods; 2) reliance on                 out-of-date statistical analysis of protein structures, performed without modem      methods of statistics: 3) most modeling methods assume a relatively high level       of sequence identity (>35 percent) between template structure and sequence to        be modeled, when most proteins of unknown structure are only distantly related       to proteins of known structure. The PI proposes benchmarking, new statistical        analysis, and new algorithms for each of the three major aspects of homology         modeling: alignment, building backbone coordinates for insertiondeletion             regions, and sidechain placement. The primary tools will be Bayesian                 statistical analysis, including hierarchical models and non-parametric methods       based on the Dirichlet process. The increase in size of the sequence and             structure databases makes the new statistical analysis timely, both because of       the increased power the new data provide, and the numerous applications              afforded by more sequences and structures.                                                                                                                                n/a",Bayesian Statistics and Algorithms for Homology Modeling,6440018,R01HG002302,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer simulation', ' functional /structural genomics', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' statistics /biometry', ' transposon /insertion element']",NHGRI,INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R01,2002,284369,0.14173288576104104
"COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary structure.  Deciphering this relationship, the protein folding problem has become increasingly important to molecular biologists.  With the dramatic progress of the genome initiatives within the public and private sector and the push for a structural genomics initiative in the post-genomic era, the need for computational strategies to relate protein sequence to protein structure become even more profound.  This proposal describes new directions in our effort to improve the accuracy of protein secondary structure and to use these results and others to improve the results of threading algorithms that map new sequences onto existing structures.  We continue to be impressed by the information inherent in a family of protein sequences, especially when viewed from an evolutionary perspective.  A study of the ligand binding domain and the corresponding ligands of intranuclear hormone receptors is planned.  This effort will link computation, molecular biology and synthetic chemistry efforts to better understand this pharmacologically exciting group of molecules.  In addition, an evolutionary trace strategy is described that could lead to the identification of pairs of covarying residues within a family of aligned sequences.

"FUNCTION DIVERGENCE IN PROTEIN FAMILIES The goal of the proposed research is to study functional similarities            and differences between proteins with broadly similar structures, but            no recognizable sequence similarity. Automated structure comparison              programs, together with a new generation of fold prediction algorithms,          provide us with many examples of proteins that do, or are likely to,             belong to the same structural class.  At the same time, such broad               structural similarity may or may not be connected to any functional              similarity.

"MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (verbatim from applicant's abstract): The long-term focus of this        research program has been microtubules (MTs) and the mechanisms of their             assembly and function in mitosis, cytokinesis, and motility. Accurate                chromosome segregation depends on the dynamics and polarity of spindle MTs, the      activities of motor proteins associated with MT s, the activities of protein         components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as Mad2p, and the ability of      MTs to direct the plane of cytokinesis for accurate segregation of the               chromosomes. Errors in segregation can induce cancer and developmental defects.      In continuing and expanding on previous research efforts, we will be analyzing       the properties and functions of MTs and associated proteins that are involved        with various aspects of mitosis and cytokinesis. A major strength of our work        has been the development and application of new techniques in quantitative           optical microscopy and dynamic digital imaging of living cells and cytoplasmic       extracts. Here we propose to develop a new digital imaging microscope system         that combines multiwavelength fluorescence, DIC, and fluorescence speckle            microscopy with fluorescence redistribution after laser photobleaching or            photoactivation and laser optical trapping. We also will improve our computer        vision methods for measuring the mechanical and assembly properties of MTs.          This new technology will enable us to analyze the dynamics of kinetochore            protein assembly and function in the recruitment of MTs by kinetochores,             chromosome motility, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint as well as the               molecular mechanisms of MT poleward flux and its function in mitosis. Using          budding yeast genetics and digital imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we will           identify molecular components, including MT motor proteins, that are involved        with the coupling of force generation to the assembly/disassembly of MTs. We         intend to continue investigating the mechanisms of MT dynamic instability and        the biophysical properties of MTs, including the action of anticancer tubulin        drugs. Finally, we will analyze how MT dynamics may be involved in the               regulation of cytokinesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          n/a",MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION,6518950,R01GM024364,"['Urodela', ' Xenopus', ' alternatives to animals in research', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell cycle', ' cell motility', ' centromere', ' chromosome movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system hardware', ' contact inhibition', ' cytoskeletal proteins', ' digital imaging', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' meiosis', ' microtubules', ' mitotic spindle apparatus', ' nanotechnology', ' photoactivation', ' protein binding', ' protein biosynthesis', ' protein structure function', ' technology /technique development', ' tissue /cell culture', ' video microscopy', ' yeasts']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2002,337253,0.07374161774052891
"NMR TECHNOLOGY FOR STRUCTURAL GENOMICS OF BREAST CANCER Genomics research is providing unprecedented access to expression vectors for thousands of proteins and it is critical to develop faster structure-determination technology to discover their cellular roles. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful and widely used method to determine accurate protein structures, but is also time consuming. Progress in understanding eukaryotic mechanisms of replication, transcription and translation depends critically on gaining faster access to structures of domains and proteins identified in human and other genome projects. We propose new technology for fast protein structure determination by solution state NMR. We will develop and demonstrate this technology on the 127 residue bromodomain from yeast Sth1p. Bromodomain has been chosen for its relevance to the regulation of acetylation states of histones in eukaryotic DNA. The BrD stucture will yield insights into its roles in transcription activation and repression protein complexes and should help to clarify the role of acetylation regulation in carcinogenesis. We will transfer this technology to demonstrate high throughput determination of multiple structures associated with breast cancer gene sequences in collaboration with the newly established Harvard Structural Genomics of Cancer Initiative. We expect that discovery of new eukaryotic protein structures will lead to a reevaluation of targets identified for drug design and to new directions for cancer studies.  n/a",NMR TECHNOLOGY FOR STRUCTURAL GENOMICS OF BREAST CANCER,6294191,F32CA089940,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasms', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy', ' protein structure', ' transcription factor']",NCI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY (MEDICAL SCHOOL),F32,2001,40196,0.06842781445621297
"COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                                                                                                                  The long-term goal of our research is the development of better methods for          identifying distantly related protein and DNA sequences, and to exploit our          ability to detect distant homologies to explore the duplication, fusion, and         other processes responsible for increases in protein diversity.  Although            similarity searching is now a routine first step in the characterization of          newly determined sequences, we believe that additional improvements in               similarity searching methods will allow investigators to look back more deeply       in evolutionary time.  Moreover, as complete protein sequence sets become            available for more organisms, sequence information can be exploited more             effectively for functional genomics and traditional biochemical problems.  The       availability of complete genome sequences, combined with reliable and                sensitive sequence comparison algorithms, also allows us to test hypotheses          about the possible emergence of novel proteins over the past 200-1,200 million       years.  Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To extend the           average look-back time provided by protein sequence similarity searching.  We        propose improvements to the scoring methods and statistics analysis of               similarity scores that seek to push back the protein similarity-search horizon       from 1.5-2-fold, to more than 2,000 million years for most protein families.         (2) To develop a higher performance, more flexible and user-friendly FASTA           package.  (3) To study repeated domains in proteins.  We will develop more           quantitative methods for identifying both simple sequence and long-period            repeats in proteins.  We will characterize the fraction of repeat-containing         proteins in proteomes, characterize the fraction of domain-structured proteins       that are not internally repetitive, and ask whether these proteins duplicate         or diverge with patterns that differ from ""normal"" single domain proteins.           (4) To explore genome-scale protein evolution and to identify potential              ""novel"" or ""young"" protein families or domains.  Over the next 2-4 years, more       than six genomes that have diverged in the last 400 million years - an               evolutionary distance sufficiently short that we should be able to identify          all protein homologs - will become available.  We will compare complete              genomes searching for newly emergent sequences.  (5) We will develop and             characterize unified methods for the simultaneous construction of alignments         and phylogenies over multiple sequences.  We will also develop standalone            tree-based alignment heuristics capable of rapidly aligning large numbers of         sequences.                                                                                                                                                                n/a",COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES,6391262,R01LM004969,"['artificial intelligence', ' biochemical evolution', ' chemical information system', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure', ' statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R01,2001,364198,0.1403261943988987
"BIOINFORMATICS, DISORDERED PROTEINS, AND FUNCTION A major objective of bioinformatics is to predict protein structure/function from sequence; the most successful current methods use sequence homology.  These current homology-based methods explicitly or implicitly assume the paradigm sequence yields structure yields function.  Since protein function depends on flexibility, movement, or even lack of structure (disorder) in some cases, combining various motion predictions with structure predictions should improve prediction of function.  Algorithms for predicting flexibility from sequence and local disorder have been developed, as have algorithms to predict sequences that snitch between two structured states.  Sequence complexity might also be an indirect measure of mobility and still other measures could be discovered by the study of known examples.  We propose to determine the interplay of homology-based predictions that use sequence information only with explicit representations of both structure information and motion information as determined from amino acid sequence.  Structural information will be represented by helix, sheet, etc., predictions, and by hydrophobic moment calculations.  Motion information will be represented by flexibility prediction, switch sequence prediction, order / disorder prediction, sequence complexity, and new measures if any are discovered in the course of this work.  Since different functions would involve motional parameters to different extents, the plan is to apply this combined approach on a sequence family basis.  Novel comparisons, called Attribute Profiles, are proposed for the representation of structure and motion information.  Sets of Gribskov/Eisenberg 1D Profiles and associated Attribute Profiles will be combined into single predictions using neural network data models.  Prediction outcomes will be compared with experimental observations and evaluated using the jackknife method.  If successful, this work will improve prediction of protein function from amino acid sequence, which is important given the significant numbers of protein sequences with undetermined functions coming out of the various genome projects.  Motion and disorder are important pieces that need to be added to the characterization of protein structure/function.  For example, taxol has been shown recently to bind to a disordered loop in Bcl-2.  Alzheimer disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Parkinson disease and infectious agents such as Staphylococcal aureus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and (perhaps) HIV depend critically on disordered regions of protein.  Thus, understanding the interplay of sequence, flexibility, order / disorder, complexity, structure and function clearly relates to human health.  n/a","BIOINFORMATICS, DISORDERED PROTEINS, AND FUNCTION",6391288,R01LM006916,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' conformation', ' hydropathy', ' informatics', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' structural biology']",NLM,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,332118,0.09432238731963388

We         intend to continue investigating the mechanisms of MT dynamic instability and        the biophysical properties of MTs, including the action of anticancer tubulin        drugs.

"COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES   DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                                                                                                                  The long-term goal of our research is the development of better methods for          identifying distantly related protein and DNA sequences, and to exploit our          ability to detect distant homologies to explore the duplication, fusion, and         other processes responsible for increases in protein diversity.  Although            similarity searching is now a routine first step in the characterization of          newly determined sequences, we believe that additional improvements in               similarity searching methods will allow investigators to look back more deeply       in evolutionary time.  Moreover, as complete protein sequence sets become            available for more organisms, sequence information can be exploited more             effectively for functional genomics and traditional biochemical problems.  The       availability of complete genome sequences, combined with reliable and                sensitive sequence comparison algorithms, also allows us to test hypotheses          about the possible emergence of novel proteins over the past 200-1,200 million       years.  Over the next five years, our specific aims are: (1) To extend the           average look-back time provided by protein sequence similarity searching.  We        propose improvements to the scoring methods and statistics analysis of               similarity scores that seek to push back the protein similarity-search horizon       from 1.5-2-fold, to more than 2,000 million years for most protein families.         (2) To develop a higher performance, more flexible and user-friendly FASTA           package.  (3) To study repeated domains in proteins.  We will develop more           quantitative methods for identifying both simple sequence and long-period            repeats in proteins.  We will characterize the fraction of repeat-containing         proteins in proteomes, characterize the fraction of domain-structured proteins       that are not internally repetitive, and ask whether these proteins duplicate         or diverge with patterns that differ from ""normal"" single domain proteins.           (4) To explore genome-scale protein evolution and to identify potential              ""novel"" or ""young"" protein families or domains.  Over the next 2-4 years, more       than six genomes that have diverged in the last 400 million years - an               evolutionary distance sufficiently short that we should be able to identify          all protein homologs - will become available.  We will compare complete              genomes searching for newly emergent sequences.  (5) We will develop and             characterize unified methods for the simultaneous construction of alignments         and phylogenies over multiple sequences.  We will also develop standalone            tree-based alignment heuristics capable of rapidly aligning large numbers of         sequences.                                                                                                                                                                n/a",COMPARISON OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES & STRUCTURES,6130119,R01LM004969,"['artificial intelligence', ' biochemical evolution', ' chemical information system', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure', ' statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R01,2000,348838,0.1403261943988987
"COMPUTER ALGORITHM FOR MODELING PROTEIN STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION:  In this revised application of his competitive renewal, Dr.        Moult proposes to understand the relationship between protein structure and      sequence by extending present computational search algorithms and analyzing      free energy functions, as well as investigating potentials based on              alternative physical methods.  Dr. Moult will test and extend Monte Carlo,       genetic algorithm and other co-operative algorithmic conformational search       methods, test and improve potentials, use folding simulation methods to          probe the extent of context independent conformational choice in fragments       of protein structures and to investigate the folding of protein domains by       propagation methods.                                                              n/a",COMPUTER ALGORITHM FOR MODELING PROTEIN STRUCTURE,6164576,R01GM041034,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' hydropathy', ' intermolecular interaction', ' ionic bond', ' model design /development', ' protein folding', ' protein structure']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2000,139881,0.1166953682586617
"BIOINFORMATICS, DISORDERED PROTEINS, AND FUNCTION A major objective of bioinformatics is to predict protein structure/function from sequence; the most successful current methods use sequence homology.  These current homology-based methods explicitly or implicitly assume the paradigm sequence yields structure yields function.  Since protein function depends on flexibility, movement, or even lack of structure (disorder) in some cases, combining various motion predictions with structure predictions should improve prediction of function.  Algorithms for predicting flexibility from sequence and local disorder have been developed, as have algorithms to predict sequences that snitch between two structured states.  Sequence complexity might also be an indirect measure of mobility and still other measures could be discovered by the study of known examples.  We propose to determine the interplay of homology-based predictions that use sequence information only with explicit representations of both structure information and motion information as determined from amino acid sequence.  Structural information will be represented by helix, sheet, etc., predictions, and by hydrophobic moment calculations.  Motion information will be represented by flexibility prediction, switch sequence prediction, order / disorder prediction, sequence complexity, and new measures if any are discovered in the course of this work.  Since different functions would involve motional parameters to different extents, the plan is to apply this combined approach on a sequence family basis.  Novel comparisons, called Attribute Profiles, are proposed for the representation of structure and motion information.  Sets of Gribskov/Eisenberg 1D Profiles and associated Attribute Profiles will be combined into single predictions using neural network data models.  Prediction outcomes will be compared with experimental observations and evaluated using the jackknife method.  If successful, this work will improve prediction of protein function from amino acid sequence, which is important given the significant numbers of protein sequences with undetermined functions coming out of the various genome projects.  Motion and disorder are important pieces that need to be added to the characterization of protein structure/function.  For example, taxol has been shown recently to bind to a disordered loop in Bcl-2.  Alzheimer disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Parkinson disease and infectious agents such as Staphylococcal aureus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and (perhaps) HIV depend critically on disordered regions of protein.  Thus, understanding the interplay of sequence, flexibility, order / disorder, complexity, structure and function clearly relates to human health.  n/a","BIOINFORMATICS, DISORDERED PROTEINS, AND FUNCTION",6033672,R01LM006916,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' conformation', ' hydropathy', ' informatics', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' structural biology']",NLM,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,309826,0.09432238731963388
"EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION The goal of this project is to develop a computer algorithm that accurately predicts the tertiary fold of a protein given only its amino acid sequence and sparse experimental constraints or an imperfect secondary structure prediction. It will use an evolutionary optimization algorithm, a detailed atomic representation, and a proprietary method for deriving a protein energy function. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) improve the representation of the problem; (2) improve the optimization algorithm; (3) parameterize a more accurate protein energy function; and (4) validate the prototype algorithm and energy function on a large sample of known protein structures and in blind structure prediction experiments. In Phase III the algorithm will be developed into commercial software products for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  The long-term goal is to help satisfy the rapidly growing demand for the accurate prediction of protein structures from sequence information. This demand arises not only from the exponential growth of the database of sequences, but also from the need to understand the structure and function of newly discovered gene products known to be involved in human disease.

"COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary structure.  Deciphering this relationship, the protein folding problem has become increasingly important to molecular biologists.  With the dramatic progress of the genome initiatives within the public and private sector and the push for a structural genomics initiative in the post-genomic era, the need for computational strategies to relate protein sequence to protein structure become even more profound.  This proposal describes new directions in our effort to improve the accuracy of protein secondary structure and to use these results and others to improve the results of threading algorithms that map new sequences onto existing structures.  We continue to be impressed by the information inherent in a family of protein sequences, especially when viewed from an evolutionary perspective.  A study of the ligand binding domain and the corresponding ligands of intranuclear hormone receptors is planned.  This effort will link computation, molecular biology and synthetic chemistry efforts to better understand this pharmacologically exciting group of molecules.  In addition, an evolutionary trace strategy is described that could lead to the identification of pairs of covarying residues within a family of aligned sequences.  Success in this arena would have important implications for threading algorithms.  Finally, work on the design of a novel class of abiologic sturctured heteropolymers is described that builds on our recent results with N-alkylated glycines.  n/a",COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE,6041749,R01GM039900,"['G protein', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' conformation', ' guanosinetriphosphatases', ' high performance liquid chromatography', ' hormone receptor', ' mathematical model', ' physical model', ' protein binding', ' protein folding', ' protein sequence', ' protein structure function', ' receptor coupling', ' transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2000,353940,0.1358881191385006
"FUNCTION DIVERGENCE IN PROTEIN FAMILIES The goal of the proposed research is to study functional similarities            and differences between proteins with broadly similar structures, but            no recognizable sequence similarity. Automated structure comparison              programs, together with a new generation of fold prediction algorithms,          provide us with many examples of proteins that do, or are likely to,             belong to the same structural class.  At the same time, such broad               structural similarity may or may not be connected to any functional              similarity.  A database of protein structure and function will be built,         allowing a search for groups of proteins with certain structural and             functional features.  Such groups will then be analyzed to identify              structurally and functionally important regions in the sequence and to           match them with levels of structural and functional similarity/                  divergence.  A combination of comparative modeling and structure                 analysis of protein structures will be used and forged into a                    standardized set of theoretical tools and procedures that could be               predicted using threading and sequence analysis, but whose sequence              divergence is large enough to expect significant functional differences.         The overall goal of the research described in this project is to bring           an understanding of the sequence/structure/function relationship or              selected proteins to a level where the detailed predictions of function          and mode of action for newly sequenced proteins could be accomplished.

"PROTEIN SURFACE DATABASE W/ FAST QUERIES FOR HOMOLOGY The need for general tools to admit facile query of the collection of            information in the Protein Database has become of significant interest           not only within the community of structural biology but also within the          community of molecular biologists interested in using structure to               elucidate sequence and structure-function relationships. While tools have        been developed to implement database queries to find similar protein             substructures or similar 3D constellations of residues, to date no               general tools have been developed to implement queries based on                  similarity between protein surfaces. This seems an egregious omission: it        is the shape and properties of the protein surface which impart its lock-        and-key specificity and are hence responsible for function.  A suite of          tools for the three dimensional query, superposition, and analysis of            protein surfaces would find a plethora of practical applications                 (outlined below), and would significantly enhance the practical value of         the collection of protein structures in the Protein Database. It is the          purpose of this proposal to develop such capabilities, admitting queries,        visualization, and analyses of protein surfaces in terms of steric and           biochemical properties. Starting points for the work will consist of the         Primary Topographical Sketch for feature recognition which is well-              developed in the field of Computer Vision, and the collection of                 biochemical surface analysis and visualization tools assembled into the          popular program GRASP developed at Columbia University.

"MECHANISMS OF MITOTIC SPINDLE ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTION   DESCRIPTION (verbatim from applicant's abstract): The long-term focus of this        research program has been microtubules (MTs) and the mechanisms of their             assembly and function in mitosis, cytokinesis, and motility. Accurate                chromosome segregation depends on the dynamics and polarity of spindle MTs, the      activities of motor proteins associated with MT s, the activities of protein         components of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, such as Mad2p, and the ability of      MTs to direct the plane of cytokinesis for accurate segregation of the               chromosomes. Errors in segregation can induce cancer and developmental defects.      In continuing and expanding on previous research efforts, we will be analyzing       the properties and functions of MTs and associated proteins that are involved        with various aspects of mitosis and cytokinesis. A major strength of our work        has been the development and application of new techniques in quantitative           optical microscopy and dynamic digital imaging of living cells and cytoplasmic       extracts. Here we propose to develop a new digital imaging microscope system         that combines multiwavelength fluorescence, DIC, and fluorescence speckle            microscopy with fluorescence redistribution after laser photobleaching or            photoactivation and laser optical trapping. We also will improve our computer        vision methods for measuring the mechanical and assembly properties of MTs.          This new technology will enable us to analyze the dynamics of kinetochore            protein assembly and function in the recruitment of MTs by kinetochores,             chromosome motility, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint as well as the               molecular mechanisms of MT poleward flux and its function in mitosis.

"Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents, and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBank's depth and breadth makes it an ideal data source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties. Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other databases. ! Project Narrative Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics and reagents are discovered and developed.!",Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database,9994932,R44GM117961,"['Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Meteor', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'data submission', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'peer', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,"PROTABIT, LLC",R44,2020,495160,0.09067386553607161
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research. This project will develop and apply cutting-edge deep- learning methods to deliver various sequence-based computational tools for gaining new knowledge, accelerating drug development, and improving personalized diagnosis and treatment.",Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction,9925232,R35GM126985,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Plug-in', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'drug development', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'online resource', 'open source', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'software systems', 'supervised learning', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2020,378183,0.06463239865545357
"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9963288,R01GM124559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,384165,0.11457715609186898
"Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning Project Summary Overview of research: The Reuel Group at Iowa State University (founded Fall 2016) seeks to develop new materials, methods, and measurement devices for biomanufacturing, biotherapeutics, and biosensors. We have active work-streams in 1) optical nanosensors for protein binding, enzymatic activity, and cell membrane disruption, 2) scalable and reliable cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) methods for protein prototyping (extract and genetic template improvements), 3) microfluidics for droplet generation and measurement of CFPS products, interrogated by nanosensors, 4) algorithms for `big data' generated from nanosensors (machine learning and deep learning methods), 5) engineered endospores for time-delayed synthetic biology circuits, and 6) resonant radio frequency sensors for biomanufacturing, wound healing, and water quality. The overall vision of the research program is to simplify and improve the design and manufacturing of biological products (cells and proteins) for applications in therapies, advanced materials, and bio-electronics. Protein based therapies have demonstrated in clinic to be a potent tool in the treatment of many diseases. In recent years, the design, build, and test cycle to find therapies for new disease targets has improved dramatically using techniques such as surface display coupled to evolutionary selection. However, these mutagenic approaches have a few limitations, namely: 1) they require a suitable, naturally occurring sequence as a starting point, 2) they frequently optimize solely on a single desired feature, and 3) they operate as a `black box', meaning that generalizable design rules for in silico prediction of future products is not possible. It is the purpose of this MIRA for ESI research plan to design a closed-loop system that allows for unsupervised design and discovery of protein therapeutics that overcomes these limitations. Over the next five years we will build and integrate the system components which include enzymatic DNA synthesis coupled to cell free protein synthesis to rapidly prototype libraries of custom proteins in micro-droplet reactors. These proteins will then be characterized in the micro-droplets using optical nanosensors, to test for desired features such as stability, binding affinity, selectivity, hydrolytic activity, and/or membrane penetration. This will produce a large labeled data set (tying sequence to phenotypic properties) that can be used to train a deep learning neural network to self-determine sequence patterns for specific properties. Once the tuning coefficients of the network are found, the algorithm will then predict next best sequences which will be synthesized, tested, etc. such that the design loop progresses unsupervised until optimization criteria are met. This new approach will result in faster development of protein therapies that are optimized based on multiple criteria and not tied to existing, natural sequences. For patients this translates to more efficacious therapies with less side effects and a potential for reduced cost (due to shortened design timeline). At the end of the five-year project we will seek to translate this technology, via NIH SBIR funding, such that the new technology can make an impact on actual therapies. Project Narrative This project seeks to develop advanced tools to enable faster discovery and design of protein-based drugs for new disease targets. These tools would enable optimization of multiple parameters simultaneously, creating more potent therapies with less side effects. Thanks to speeding up the development cycle and reducing the time to market, these tools also have the potential to reduce end cost to patients.","Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning",10028304,R35GM138265,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomanufacturing', 'Biosensor', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Template', 'In Vitro', 'Iowa', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning strategy', 'nanosensors', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'synthetic biology', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'water quality', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,327666,0.06417614838027645
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure is an important step towards understanding of biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. Although experimental structure determination has been greatly improved, there is still a very large gap between the number of available protein sequences and that of solved protein structures, which can only be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing sequence, structure and functional data and to develop data-driven computational methods and tools for structure and functional prediction. We believe that by developing sophisticated algorithms to extract knowledge from the increasing sequence and structure data, we can model protein sequence-structure relationship very accurately and improve structure and functional prediction greatly. This project has already produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data- driven algorithms and web servers (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for protein structure modeling. This renewal will further develop machine learning (especially deep learning) algorithms for protein structure modeling without good templates. The specific aims are: (1) developing deep learning (DL) algorithms for the prediction of protein contact and distance matrix; (2) developing distance-based algorithms for fast and accurate ab initio folding of proteins without templates; (3) developing DL algorithms for template-based modeling with only weakly similar templates. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure relationship and yield publicly available resources for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing our web servers to study a wide variety of proteins relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure relationship and to predict protein structures. The results will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as better understanding of disease processes, development of novel diagnostics and drugs, and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.",New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction,9817856,R01GM089753,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Occupations', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model building', 'neural network', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'therapeutic development', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'web server']",NIGMS,TOYOTA TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE / CHICAGO,R01,2020,319222,0.17104253203494657
"Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT About 1500 of the ~20,000 protein-coding genes of the human genome can bind drug-like molecules, and yet only about 600 are currently targeted by FDA-approved drugs. Therefore, at least 930 proteins are potential drug targets that are not yet being utilized for human medicine and, given our incomplete state of knowledge about the human genome, the actual number could be much higher. There is therefore a substantial unmet need to improve our understanding of this so-called genomic dark matter in order to develop novel classes of drugs to improve treatment of disease. Comprehensive experimental investigation of these proteins in the context of hundreds of thousands of compounds and thousands of diseases would be prohibitively expensive, but computational approaches could significantly refine the list. In this project we will apply two sophisticated computational approaches to the task of predicting the most promising novel drug targets. We will integrate the knowledge bases DrugCentral and other resources with the disease and phenotype knowledge base of the Monarch Initiative into a semantically harmonized knowledge graph (KG). This will result in a KG with comprehensive coverage of diseases, genes, gene functions, phenotypic abnormalities, drugs, drug mechanisms, and drug targets. Machine learning (ML) identifies patterns from training sets and applies the patterns to predict entities and relations in new data. ML using KGs has become a hot new research area in computer science, but remains difficult to use for real-world applications, owing to the lack of adequate software packages. We will therefore implement state-of-the art learning algorithms based on deep learning on KGs by extending and adapting selected algorithms to the task of drug and drug target discovery. We will develop an easy-to-use software library and demonstrate its use by means of notebooks that will be designed to serve as starting points for future computational research by other scientists, since they will contain the analysis workflow along with documentation about each step. The human genome codes more than 500 protein kinases, which are enzymes that add a phosphate group to specific amino acid residues and thereby transmit a biological signal. There are currently 35 FDA approved protein kinase modulators acting on 38 protein kinases, which are thus one of the most important groups of druggable proteins encoded by our genome. We will perform a detailed computational study of this group and experimentally validate our top, novel candidate using a patient-derived xenograft model system. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The human genome codes for over 20,000 proteins, roughly 3,000 of which are thought to be “druggable”, meaning that in principle they could be targeted by medications to treat disease. However, only about 600 of these proteins are currently targeted by an approved medication, and our knowledge about most of the remaining proteins is limited. Our goal is to develop bioinformatic software that will combine information about these proteins, diseases, clinical manifestations, medications, and other relevant data into a network of information (i.e., a graph), and to use sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict novel drugs and drug targets. We will focus our computational strategy on the class of protein kinase inhibitors, which are a leading target for cancer drugs. The human genome encodes an estimated 555 kinases, 37 of which have been successfully targeted by anti-cancer medications. By using machine learning to predict which of the remaining 500+ protein kinases are most likely to be amenable to medical treatment, there is a potential to accelerate the pace of research into novel treatments. We will perform a pilot study of the top predicted candidates using a mouse model of cancer.",Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs,9878081,U01CA239108,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aloral', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enzymes', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Molecular Biology', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computer science', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'genome resource', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'open source', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'protein kinase modulator', 'real world application', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NCI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U01,2020,536615,0.05961439856718282
"Building protein structure models for intermediate resolution cryo-electron microscopy maps Project Summary Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an emerging technique in structural biology, which is capable of determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules. Compared to conventional structural biology techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR, a major advantage of cryo-EM is its ability to solve large macromolecular assemblies. Moreover, recent technical breakthroughs in cryo-EM have enabled determination of 3D structures at nearly atomic-level resolutions. Cryo-EM will undoubtedly become a method of central importance in structural biology in the next decade. With the rapid accumulation of cryo-EM structure data, it has become crucial to develop computational methods that can effectively build and extract 3D structures of biological macromolecules from EM maps. The goal of this project is to develop computational methods for modeling both global and local structures and for interpreting 3D structures embedded in EM maps of around 4 Å to medium-resolution. Recently, we have developed a new de novo protein structure modeling method, MAINMAST, which can model protein structures from an EM density map without using existing template or fragment structures on the map. Based on the successful development of MAINMAST, we further extend the capability of MAINMAST toward more accurate modeling and for multiple-chain modeling. In addition, we will also develop novel modeling methods for medium-resolution EM maps, which combine a coarse-grained protein structure modeling technique, methods in protein structure prediction, and a low- resolution image processing approach with deep learning, a state-of-the-art powerful machine learning method. The proposed project capitalizes on the tremendous efforts and progress made in structural determination with cryo-EM by developing computational tools that allow researchers to perform efficient and reliable structure analyses for 3D EM density maps. The project will greatly facilitate investigation into the molecular mechanisms of macromolecule function by providing an efficient means of 3D structure modeling. Narrative Cryo-electron microscopy is an emerging technique for determining the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules.

"Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction Project Summary Predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins without using known structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates (ab initio) remains a grand challenge of computational biology. Whereas template-based modeling is now a mature field, ab initio modeling is a comparatively nascent one, especially for large proteins with complex topologies and multiple domains. The need for advances in ab initio modeling is evident. A lot of protein sequences do not have (recognizable) templates in the PDB, and the pace of experimental structure determination is incommensurate with the scale of the problem. Herein, we propose a new approach to ab initio modeling that consists of novel deep learning architectures to predict inter- residue distances and domain boundaries as well as robust, iterative optimization methods to construct tertiary structures from the predicted distances. This project builds on the success of our current R01, particularly the outstanding performance of the Cheng group in the 2018 worldwide protein structure prediction experiment – CASP13 – where our MULTICOM suite ranked among the top three tertiary structure predictors, alongside Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold. The methods will be implemented as open-source tools for the emerging field of distance-based ab initio protein structure modeling. We will apply the methods to study protein homo-oligomers and self-assemblies, based on our novel discovery that the quaternary structure contacts within homo-oligomers can be predicted by deep learning methods from the co-evolutionary signals embedded in multiple sequence alignments of protein monomers. Furthermore, we will apply the methods to predict the folds, functional sites, superfamilies, and protein-protein interactions of proteins that contain “essential Domains of Unknown Function” (eDUFs), a group of evolutionarily conserved, essential proteins that represents an important uncharted region of protein function/fold space. The predictions for a diverse and representative subset of eDUFs will be experimentally validated through a unique collaboration with the structural biology group of Dr. Tanner. Project Narrative Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research, but experimental techniques will only resolve a small fraction of known proteins due to the considerable cost. This project will develop cutting-edge computational methods based on modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology to reliably predict protein structures from sequence information alone.

"High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy. Because they are sensitive to the biological functional groups, detailed geometries, and chemical environments, they allow for prediction of solution phase protein structures or to identify or verify the structure of chemical compounds in the crystalline phase. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for NMR spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this equipment supplement we are proposing to acquire a dedicated compute cluster for high throughput calculations of wavefunction-based QM methods we have developed for chemical shifts that offer improved accuracy over DFT. This will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein and small molecule drug relevant for machine learning methods we have developed under NIH support. With such data, machine learning and deep networks will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting data science driven methods will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and small molecule drug prediction. NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This supplemental equipment proposal aims to use machine learning on QM data through the purchase of a high-throughput GPU/CPU cluster, and will significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or drug crystal, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,10145510,U01GM121667,"['Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'crystallinity', 'drug structure', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,150000,0.08139971353340515
"Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms The cellular network and its environment govern cell and organism behavior and are fundamental to the comprehension of function, misfunction and drug discovery. Over the last few years, drugs were observed to often bind to more than one target; thus, poly-pharmacology approaches can be advantageous, complementing the ""one drug - one target"" strategy. Targeting drug discovery from the systems biology standpoint can help in studies of network effects of mono- and poly-pharmacology. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the usefulness of network description and tools for mono- and poly-pharmacology, and the ways through which protein interactions can help single- and multi-target drug discovery efforts. We further describe how, when combined with experimental data, modeled structural networks which can predict which proteins interact and provide the structures of their interfaces, can model the cellular pathways, and suggest which specific pathways are likely to be affected. Such structural networks may facilitate structure-based drug design; forecast side effects of drugs; and suggest how the effects of drug binding can propagate in multi-molecular complexes and pathways. Cellular functions are performed through protein-protein interactions; therefore, identification of these interactions is crucial for understanding biological processes. Recent studies suggest that knowledge-based approaches are more useful than ""blind"" docking for modeling at large scales. However, a caveat of knowledge-based approaches is that they treat molecules as rigid structures. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) offers a wealth of conformations. Here, we exploited an ensemble of the conformations in predictions by a knowledge-based method, PRISM. We tested ""difficult"" cases in a docking-benchmark data set, where the unbound and bound protein forms are structurally different. Considering alternative conformations for each protein, the percentage of successfully predicted interactions increased from about 26 to 66%, and 57% of the interactions were successfully predicted in an ""unbiased"" scenario, in which data related to the bound forms were not utilized. If the appropriate conformation, or relevant template interface, is unavailable in the PDB, PRISM could not predict the interaction successfully. The pace of the growth of the PDB promises a rapid increase of ensemble conformations emphasizing the merit of such knowledge-based ensemble strategies for higher success rates in protein-protein interaction predictions on an interactome scale. We constructed the structural network of ERK interacting proteins as a case study. We constructed and simulated a ""minimal proteome"" model using Langevin dynamics. It contains 206 essential protein types that were compiled from the literature. For comparison, we generated six proteomes with randomized concentrations. We found that the net charges and molecular weights of the proteins in the minimal genome are not random. The net charge of a protein decreases linearly with molecular weight, with small proteins being mostly positively charged and large proteins negatively charged. The protein copy numbers in the minimal genome have the tendency to maximize the number of protein-protein interactions in the network. Negatively charged proteins that tend to have larger sizes can provide a large collision cross-section allowing them to interact with other proteins; on the other hand, the smaller positively charged proteins could have higher diffusion speed and are more likely to collide with other proteins. Proteomes with random charge/mass populations form less stable clusters than those with experimental protein copy numbers. Our study suggests that ""proper"" populations of negatively and positively charged proteins are important for maintaining a protein-protein interaction network in a proteome. It is interesting to note that the minimal genome model based on the charge and mass of Escherichia coli may have a larger protein-protein interaction network than that based on the lower organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Proteins function through their interactions, and the availability of protein interaction networks could help in understanding cellular processes. However, the known structural data are limited and the classical network node-and-edge representation, where proteins are nodes and interactions are edges, shows only which proteins interact; not how they interact. Structural networks provide this information. Protein-protein interface structures can also indicate which binding partners can interact simultaneously and which are competitive, and can help forecasting potentially harmful drug side effects. Here, we use a powerful protein-protein interactions prediction tool which is able to carry out accurate predictions on the proteome scale to construct the structural network of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This knowledge-based method, PRISM, is motif-based, and is combined with flexible refinement and energy scoring. PRISM predicts protein interactions based on structural and evolutionary similarity to known protein interfaces. We focus on improvement of PRISM toward modeling of specific interaction of key proteins in cancer and inflammation pathways to figure out regulation in central processes in the cell. We have already developed the prototype method and applied it to Helicobacter pylori and most recently, viral oncoproteins. n/a",Method Development: Efficient Computer Vision Based Algorithms,10262089,ZIABC010442,"['Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Inflammation', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Lower Organism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Modeling', 'Modeling of Cellular Pathways', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Movement', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Oncoproteins', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Protozoa', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'biological research', 'blind', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'fungus', 'globular protein', 'host-microbe interactions', 'in silico', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'mimicry', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'molecular dynamics', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'prototype', 'structured data', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web server']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2020,118343,0.13900288444599376
"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers. We will make the necessary tools, distribute them widely, and use them to solve key problems in a number of disease contexts.",Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs,9851881,R35GM130354,"['Antibody Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'HIV vaccine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Production', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'disulfide bond', 'drug discovery', 'immunogenic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein structure function', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R35,2020,377124,0.1217907220368883
"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",9942654,R01GM136859,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'COSY', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Crowding', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Drug Design', 'Environment', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'HMQC', 'Hour', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Weight', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Pyruvate', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'TOCSY', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'artificial neural network', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'control theory', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'methyl group', 'next generation', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear power', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'therapeutic development']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2020,495502,0.1125390315369024
"Finding Protein Sequence Motifs--methods And Applications The rapid accumulation of genome sequences and protein structures during the last decade has been paralleled by major advances in sequence database search methods. The powerful Position-Specific Iterating BLAST (PSI-BLAST) method developed at the NCBI forms the basis of our work on protein motif analysis. In addition, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), protein profile-against-profile comparison implemented in the HHSearch method, protein structure comparison methods, homology modeling of protein structure and genome context analysis were extensively and increasingly applied. Furthermore, custom libraries of protein domain profiles as well as computational pipelines for novel domain identification have been developed and applied. Lately, these methods for protein motif search are being complemented by deep learning computational methods.  During the year under review, we have continued and expanded our investigation of the proteins domains that are involved in virus-host interactions, and in particular, antivirus defense in prokaryotes. Bacteria and archaea are frequently attacked by viruses and other mobile genetic elements and rely on dedicated antiviral defense systems, such as restriction endonucleases and CRISPR, to survive. The enormous diversity of viruses suggests that more types of defense systems exist than are currently known. We developed computational methodology for systematic prediction of genes involved in  antivirus defense and comprehensively characterized the domain architectures of the proteins encoded by these genes. As a result of these predictions followed by prediction and heterologous reconstitution, in collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Feng Zhang (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard), 29 widespread antiviral gene cassettes, collectively present in 32% of all sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, that mediate protection against specific bacteriophages. These systems incorporate enzymatic activities not previously implicated in antiviral defense, including RNA editing and retron satellite DNA synthesis. In addition, we computationally predict a diverse set of other putative defense genes that remain to be characterized. These results highlight an immense array of molecular functions that microbes use against viruses.    We further expanded our study of proteins domains involved in antivirus defense by performing a comprehensive computational census of the oligonucleotide-binding domains that are the key components of signal transduction pathways associated with CRISPR-Cas systems of adaptive immunity. CRISPR-associated Rossmann Fold (CARF) and SMODS-associated and fused to various effector domains (SAVED) are key components of cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling systems (CBASS) that sense cyclic oligonucleotides and transmit the signal to an effector inducing cell dormancy or death. Most of the CARFs are components of a CBASS built into type III CRISPR-Cas systems, where the CARF domain binds cyclic oligoA (cOA) synthesized by Cas10 polymerase-cyclase and allosterically activates the effector, typically a promiscuous ribonuclease. Additionally, this signaling pathway includes a ring nuclease, often also a CARF domain (either the sensor itself or a specialized enzyme) that cleaves cOA and mitigates dormancy or death induction. We present a comprehensive census of CARF and SAVED domains in bacteria and archaea, and their sequence- and structure-based classification. There are 10 major families of CARF domains and multiple smaller groups that differ in structural features, association with distinct effectors, and presence or absence of the ring nuclease activity. By comparative genome analysis, we predicted specific functions of CARF and SAVED domains and partition the CARF domains into those with both sensor and ring nuclease functions, and sensor-only ones. Several families of ring nucleases functionally associated with sensor-only CARF domains were also predicted.     In the incessant host-parasite arms race, viruses evolved multiple anti-defense mechanisms including diverse anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) that specifically inhibit CRISPR-Cas and therefore have enormous potential for application as modulators of genome editing tools. Most Acrs are small and highly variable proteins which makes their bioinformatic prediction a formidable task. We developed a machine-learning approach for comprehensive Acr prediction. The model shows high predictive power when tested against an unseen test set and was employed to predict 2,500 candidate Acr families. Experimental validation of top candidates revealed two unknown Acrs (AcrIC9, IC10) and three other top candidates were coincidentally identified and found to possess anti-CRISPR activity. These results substantially expand the repertoire of predicted Acrs and provide a resource for experimental Acr discovery.   Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an immediate, major threat to public health across the globe. Given this new major public health problem, we launched a new research direction aimed at the identification of motifs in coronavirus proteins that are likely to be associated with increased virulence in humans and zoonotic transmission into the human population. We performed an in-depth molecular analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary origins of the enhanced pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that are severe human pathogens. Using integrated comparative genomics and machine learning techniques, we identified key genomic features that differentiate SARS-CoV-2 and the viruses behind the two previous deadly coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), from less pathogenic coronaviruses. These features include enhancement of the nuclear localization signals in the nucleocapsid protein and distinct inserts in the spike glycoprotein that appear to be associated with high case fatality rate of these coronaviruses as well as the host switch from animals to humans. The identified features could be crucial contributors to coronavirus pathogenicity and possible targets for diagnostics, prognostication, and interventions.   The research on protein domains and motifs performed during the last year has led to further progress in the study of the classification, evolution, and functions of several classes of proteins and domains, particularly, those involved in host-parasite interactions and other forms of biological conflicts.  These findings have potential implications for human health and for developments in biotechnology. Additionally, protein motifs that are likely to contribute to coronavirus pathogenicity have been identified. n/a",Finding Protein Sequence Motifs--methods And Applications,10261214,ZIALM000061,"['2019-nCoV', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Archaea', 'Archaeal Genome', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronavirus', 'Custom', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA cassette', 'Defense Mechanisms', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dissection', 'Enzymes', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Nuclear Localization Signal', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Parasites', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Structure Initiative', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RNA Editing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleases', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Satellite DNA', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'adaptive immunity', 'arm', 'base', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'computational pipelines', 'cross-species transmission', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'genome analysis', 'genome editing', 'human pathogen', 'markov model', 'molecular array', 'molecular sequence database', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'prognostic', 'protein profiling', 'protein structure', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'sensor', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus host interaction']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2020,413126,0.10290978775276646
"Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins Project Summary Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biological entities to form biological pathways inside and between cells. Targeted therapies are designed to mitigate or reverse malfunctions caused by mutations in proteins via providing drugs to recover normal biological pathways’ activities. Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways is a powerful way to infer potential functions of these proteins. Pathway-based approaches are now routinely applied in bioinformatics and computational biology data analysis and visualization. Pathway databases are essential for those approaches. During the past two decades, our team has been working together on building the Reactome knowledgebase, arguably the most popular and comprehensive open source biological pathway database, covering over half of human protein-coding genes and widely used in the research community. In this application, we propose to develop a Reactome IDG pathway portal, which will allow localization of understudied proteins in biological pathways, identifying likely interactions with better-known proteins in specific processes annotated in Reactome, pinpointing most effective drug targets via pathway modeling, thus generating testable predictions of molecular functions of these proteins in key domains of biology. Specially we will develop a web-based application to place understudied proteins in the context of Reactome pathways by importing a variety of data types collected in the IDG projects and other resources and then overlaying them onto the Reactome pathways by leveraging existing Reactome software tools (e.g. interaction overlay). Furthermore, we will develop a machine learning approach to predict functional interactions between understudied proteins and well-known Reactome annotated proteins and a Boolean network-based fuzzy logic modeling approach to integrate the scores produced from the machine learning approach to simulate the impacts of understudied proteins on pathways’ activities. We believe our approach will provide a unique and powerful approach to help the community to understand the contribution of the understudied proteins to cellular functions. Project Narrative Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways provides a framework to understand potential functions of these proteins.

"High-throughput discovery of protein energy landscapes in natural and designed proteomes Project Summary All folded proteins continuously fluctuate between their low-energy native structures and higher-energy “hidden” conformations that can be partially or fully unfolded. Although each protein molecule passes through its high- energy conformations only a small fraction of the time, these states have major physiological consequences. Partially-folded states of natural proteins can lead to protein aggregation, organ failure, and death. Partially- folded states of therapeutic proteins can induce dangerous anti-drug antibodies. The energetic balance between the native, folded state and these diverse higher-energy states – in other words, the overall “energy landscape” – is thus critically important in protein aggregation and immunogenicity, as well as in allostery, signaling, off- target drug interactions and numerous other phenomena. Despite decades of research into energy landscapes our overall understanding is very limited: few proteins have been characterized in depth, accurate computational predictions are very challenging, and experimental measurements are expensive, slow, and labor-intensive. We propose a transformational approach to understand protein energy landscapes by integrating a new massively parallel experimental method, machine learning, and protein design. First, we are developing a new high-throughput assay using hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry to measure energy landscapes for thousands of proteins in parallel. This method finally brings the study of protein energy landscapes into the “omics” age. Critically, these experiments reveal both the overall folding stability and the energies of conformational fluctuations in each protein. For a subset of proteins (tens to hundreds), these parallel experiments reveal the specific sites of conformational fluctuations as well. Using this approach, we will measure the energy landscapes of thousands of natural proteins and tens of thousands of computationally designed proteins custom-built to systematically probe how specific properties affect energy landscapes. We will then train machine learning models to predict energy landscapes from sequence and structure, as well as optimize physical force fields to accurately model high-energy protein states. We will also catalyze advances in modeling throughout the community by organizing large-scale competitions at blind prediction of energy landscapes. Finally, with these new predictive models in hand, we will pursue a unique application: the development of energetically-optimized screening libraries for therapeutic protein and biological probe discovery. This overcomes a major challenge in drug and probe development. In sum, this study provides the experimental and computational tools to bring hidden protein states to light quantitatively on a massive scale. This fundamentally shifts our perspective: instead of examining energy landscapes only when they cause problems, we can make energy landscape analysis a central tool in biology and bioengineering. Project Narrative All proteins continuously move between their folded state and “hidden” higher-energy states that can be partially or fully unfolded. These hidden states have an important impact on how proteins interact, how they become activated, and whether they aggregate. Here, we combine protein design with a totally new high-throughput experimental approach to reveal these high-energy states for thousands of proteins in parallel, and apply these advances to build a new generation of computational models of protein energetics.",High-throughput discovery of protein energy landscapes in natural and designed proteomes,10002881,DP2GM140927,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Dangerousness', 'Development', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Generations', 'Hand', 'Hydrogen', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Organ failure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Time', 'Training', 'blind', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenicity', 'predictive modeling', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,DP2,2020,2347906,0.09694502889414176
"Super-multiplexed fluorescence nanoscopy for imaging-based proteomics PROJECT SUMMARY In situ immunofluorescence imaging is a powerful method to study the locations, expression levels and structures of proteins in cells and tissues. In particular, multiplexed imaging reveals the interaction networks of proteins, which allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms of many diseases. However, it has been challenging to perform multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging due to its extremely time-consuming process, high cost and lack of signal amplification. The limited spatial resolution achievable with confocal microscopy often fails to reveal complex spatial organization and to determine localizations of proteins. Here we propose super-multiplexed immunofluorescence nanoscopy that is capable of imaging more than twenty different proteins in 24 hours with nanoscale resolution. We will employ DNA-barcoded secondary nanobodies that are monovalent, open-source and designed for quantitative labeling. Repeated introduction and washing of fluorescent DNA imagers will generate highly multiplexed images. Moreover, we will develop unprecedentedly fast stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy that employs a parallelized line array of doughnut beams. It will feature a large imaging area and excellent optical sectioning capability. Photon reassignment, hyperspectral imaging and deep-learning will further facilitate rapid super-resolution-based protein profiling. Our new biochemical and optical tools will play crucial roles in diverse biomedical areas including brain proteomics and cancer profiling.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable.

"Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens Project Summary  Characterizing the functions of protein-coding genes is an important goal in the post-genomic era. While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning. Project Narrative  Proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions in health and disease. Yet, the functions of the majority proteins encoded by the human genome are very poorly understood. A novel high-throughput screening strategy leveraging rapid protein degradation will dramatically accelerate functional characterization of the human proteome.",Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens,9989245,F31HG011185,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell division', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA lesion', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Inclusion Bodies', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Screening Result', 'Shunt Device', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blind', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'literacy', 'mutant', 'novel', 'protein degradation', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.0890505769444972
"Data-driven Computational Modeling and Refinement of Protein Structures on Genomic Scales PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: A key remaining gap in our understanding of biological systems at the molecular level is how to structurally annotate the “dark” protein families—the portion of protein families unsolved by experimental structure determination techniques and inaccessible to homology modeling. Nearly a quarter of protein families are currently dark, where molecular conformation is completely unknown and this gap is likely to expand further with the rapid accumulation of new protein sequences without annotated structures. The key challenge is now how to bridge this gap to gain a comprehensive understanding of biology and disease, thereby paving the way to structure-based drug design at genomic scale. Computational protein modeling plays a key role in this effort due to its scalability and genome-wide applicability. My laboratory focuses on the development and application of novel data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods to increase accuracy and coverage of protein structure prediction on genomic scale irrespective of homology. Future research focuses on improving homology-free protein folding using multiscale de novo modeling driven by deep learning-based inter-residue interactions, enhancing low-homology threading or fold recognition by formulating new algorithms for remote template identification despite low evolutionary relatedness, and developing methods for high-resolution restrained structure refinement guided by generalized ensemble search for driving computational models to near-experimental accuracy. Proteome-wide computational modeling and refinement effort will be conducted, leveraging our unique access to large-scale supercomputing infrastructure, to build high-confidence models covering the dark protein families, which will be organized in a database for public access. This comprehensive database of structural annotations will shed light on the structures, functions, and interactions of the dark proteome, with broad implications in drug discovery and human health. Software and web servers will be freely disseminated to help worldwide community of biomedical researchers to apply these methods to their specific research problems, thus multiplying the impact of computational modeling on basic research in biology and medicine. My research program will involve close collaborations with other NIGMS-supported investigators, create training opportunities for the next generation of researchers including members from underrepresented groups, and foster future research advances in structural bioinformatics and computational biology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: A comprehensive atomic-level annotation of protein structures is essential for understanding the molecular basis of complex diseases and facilitating structure-based drug design. Lack of structural annotation of a major fraction protein universe, the so-called dark families, is a key gap in our understanding of molecular biology and diseases.

"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,10007852,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2020,335245,0.04701425004837323
"Towards Accurate Protein Structure Predictions with SAXS Technology (TAPESTRY) Project Summary There is an unmet need in medicine and basic sciences for accurate atomic structures of proteins. This need surpasses the capabilities of traditional high-resolution experimental methods. With machine learning advances, structure prediction algorithms are poised to provide atomic models for these areas in the near future. Yet, the gaps in prediction algorithms limit accuracy and reliability, particularly for large multi-domain proteins, protein complexes, and flexible proteins. Our proposal, Towards Accurate protein structure Predictions with SAXS TechnologY (TAPESTRY), will create technology to increase reliability and improve accuracy of protein structure predictions through experimental validation, particularly for difficult proteins. TAPESTRY is innovative by combining our strengths in high-throughput synchrotron SAXS (Small Angle X-ray Scattering) data collection and analysis with the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP), which assesses structure predictions against “gold standard”, not-yet-released crystal structures every two years. Through CASP, we take advantage of the collective protein folding knowledge of the global community of structure prediction scientists. Our approach is strategic. We provide SAXS data for CASP, giving prediction scientists access to experimental data. We develop analytical and experimental tools, designed for prediction scientists to overcome current gaps that limit the use of SAXS data. We test these tools against our TAPESTRY databases of standard proteins, with corresponding crystal structures, SAXS data, and predicted models. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our technology through CASP and obtain an unbiased assessment of our tools and the state of the field. As a first step, we target well-folded proteins (Aim 1) and proteins with disordered tails (Aim 2) in this proposal. The feasibility of our technology proposal is supported by our current data and proofs-in-concepts, our beamline capabilities, and proven experience in SAXS analysis. We show that experimental SAXS data, which contains distance information that can act as restraints in protein structure prediction algorithms, match crystal structures of well-folded proteins and score predictions based on topological accuracy. We show cases in CASP13 (2018) when SAXS data improved the fold of predicted models. SAXS data collection is rapid (10 seconds), does not require labeling or crystallization, and is available at no cost to the scientific community. We have proven experience in developing informative and effective SAXS analytical tools. Our long-term goal is to enable biomedical researchers to input an amino acid sequence and rapidly obtain an experimentally validated and accurate atomic model(s) that reflects the protein conformation(s) in solution. If TAPESTRY is successful, the increased availability of such atomic models will have strong and broad potential to advance biomedical research and impact all areas of biology in which proteins are involved. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atomic structures are critical for medical science from understanding how proteins function to drug design.

"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules. In this project, we aim to develop rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical frameworks for such tasks and apply them to study proteins, RNAs and chromosomes.",Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes,9963294,R01GM126558,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Grain', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'database structure', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genome annotation', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'protein distribution', 'protein structure', 'shape analysis', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool development']",NIGMS,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,308756,0.10664986370136406
"Development of COVID-19 cell entry inhibitors The reliability, and consequently success of virtual screening depends heavily on the accuracy of the x-ray structure depiction of the target protein structure in solution. Crystal packing can distort conformation of flexible parts of the protein thus leading to misrepresentation of the protein structure. Thus, the first step in all screening procedures is optimization and evaluation of the structure used in the screen. Structural biology of COVID-19 proteins has been developing with an explosive speed since the start of 2020 with dozens of structures being deposited to Protein Data Bank every week. We have evaluated suitability of structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP7, NSP8, NSP9, NSP10, NSP14, NSP15, NSP16, nucleocapsid RNA-binding domain and spike protein receptor-binding domain for virtual screening. All structures have undergone energy minimization procedures before the screens. Initially, they have been screen-tested using a diversity library of 1.92 million compounds that were available for 2-week delivery from Enamine LTD and a library of all drugs marketed in US. The screens were run on NIH High Performing Computing system Biowulf using ICM-Pro docking software from MolSoft and optimized docking protocols developed by us that allow for highly reliable predictions of the binders. Typically, we have been running 2000 parallel docking jobs that allowed screening about 10 million compounds a day for a single binding site in a fast screening mode. In total, we have evaluated 30 x-ray SARS-CoV-2 protein structures in test screens. 4-5 hits from the test libraries have been purchased for each target structure and tested for binding using recombinant COVID-19 proteins and nano differential scanning fluorometry (DSF). Structures of NSP7, NSP8 and NSP14 did not produce hits with binding scores below the threshold. For all other proteins (NSP9, NSP10, NSP15, NSP16, nucleocapsid RNA-binding domain and spike protein receptor-binding domain) we were able to select x-ray structures allowing for accurate prediction of binding, 10 structures in total. Significant efforts have been spent on generation of highly diverse virtual libraries of compounds for the screens. Novel libraries, Synthetically Accessible Virtual Inventory (SAVI) contain compounds that can be synthesized in one easy step from readily available blocks. Current database that was made public in April 2020 (https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/download/savi_download/) was built using 53 robust synthetic procedures or transforms and contains 1,748,464,003 products. Screening databases of that size currently is impractical. That is why we have generated SAVI diversity sets of 2,955,416 and 15 million compounds that were used for identification of initial leads. The leads identified from screening SAVI and Enamine diversity sets have been used for preparation of libraries of structurally similar compounds typically containing hundreds of thousands or 2-3 million compounds from entire SAVI library. We have used machine learning tools (MNA, Multilevel Neighborhoods of Atoms and QNA, Quantitative Neighborhoods of Atoms) generated by our collaborator Prof. Vladimir Poroikov and his colleagues from the Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia for generation of libraries of compounds with electronic structures similar to the leads. These libraries were subjected to screening by docking allowing for identification of compounds with improved docking scores. The later have been synthesized, and binding to the target proteins evaluated by NanoDifferential Scanning Fluorometry, fluorescence spectroscopy and Microscale Thermophoresis. Overall, over 200 compounds have been tested for binding. Currently, we have identified compounds that bind to NSP9, NSP10, NSP16, nucleocapsid RBD and spike protein RBD with micromolar affinity. Lead compounds bind to exonuclease NSP15 with sub micromolar affinity. Major focus currently is on the inhibitors of the exonuclease not only because it is essential for viral replication but also because the active site that we are targeting is conserved in all corona viruses. Consequently, newly developed inhibitors are likely to help fighting not only current, but also future pandemics. The leads for other proteins will be developed at later time as resources will permit. n/a",Development of COVID-19 cell entry inhibitors,10262560,ZIABC011944,"['2019-nCoV', 'Active Sites', 'Affinity', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'COVID-19', 'Cactaceae', 'Cells', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronavirus', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diversity Library', 'Docking', 'Drug Screening', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Exonuclease', 'Fluorescence Spectroscopy', 'Fluorometry', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Moscow', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nucleocapsid', 'Occupations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'Recombinants', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Russia', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'data warehouse', 'drug market', 'electronic structure', 'fighting', 'flexibility', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'nano', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'physical state', 'preclinical study', 'protein structure', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual library', 'virtual screening']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2020,303572,0.059249465053256
"Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction Abstract The success of genome sequencing over the last four decades has resulted in a rapidly increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures and functions. Because protein sequence on its own cannot tell us what each molecule does in cells, the large-scale absence of protein structure and function information severely hinders the progress of contemporary biological and medical studies. These gaps in understanding strongly call for efficient computational approaches for automated, yet highly accurate protein structure prediction and function annotation. The PI’s lab has a successful track record in developing and disseminating high-quality structural bioinformatics methods which have been widely used by the global community. In this project, the lab seeks to develop new advanced methods for both tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. Built on the tools and databases previously developed in the PI’s lab, new deep neural-network based techniques will be extended to residue-level intra- and inter-chain contact- and distance-map predictions. These predictions will then be used to constrain the conformational searching space of threading-based fragment assembly simulations, with the aim to significantly improve the accuracy and success rate of structure modeling of monomeric proteins and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially for the difficult targets that lack homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank. Next, the structure and PPI network information will be used to help elucidate multiple levels of biological and biomedical functions for protein molecules, including mutation-induced changes in protein stability and human disease predictions. The long- term goals of this project are to significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction and to narrow the gap between the abundance of protein sequence information and the dearth of protein structure and function data, thus significantly enhancing the usefulness and impact of structural bioinformatics. Success in this project will also help reveal the general principles governing the fundamental relations across sequence, structure and function of protein molecules. Relevance Researchers in contemporary drug industry need to use the knowledge of 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules for designing synthetic compounds to fight against human diseases. But many pharmaceutically important proteins do not have experimentally solved structures. This project seeks to develop advanced computer methods for high-quality protein structure prediction that can be used to function annotation and compound screening; these should have an important and general impact on drug discovery and human health.",Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction,9932039,R35GM136422,"['ART protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Industry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Induced Mutation', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Network-based', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Quaternary Protein Structure', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'fight against', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2020,431776,0.17574064108753729
"ER Network Shaping Mechanisms in the Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias Research in the Cell Biology Section, Neurogenetics Branch focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying a number of neurodegenerative disorders, most notable those affecting long axons such as peripheral neuropathies and the hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs).  These disorders worsen insidiously over a number of years, and treatment options are limited for many of them.  Our laboratory is investigating inherited forms of these disorders, using molecular and cell biology approaches to study how mutations in disease genes ultimately result in cellular dysfunction.   In this project, we are focusing on the HSPs. One major research theme involves the characterization and functional analysis of the hereditary spastic paraplegia type 3A (SPG3A) protein, atlastin-1.  In 2009, we reported in the journal Cell that atlastin-1 is a member of a ubiquitous family of GTPases that interact with two families of ER shaping proteins to generate the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network.  Interestingly, atlastin-1 interacts with the SPG31 protein REEP1, which is an ER shaping protein, as well as with other ER-shaping proteins and the SPG4 protein spastin, a microtubule-severing ATPase.  In 2010, we published a study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation demonstrating that these three proteins interact with one another to organize the tubular ER network in conjunction with the microtubule cytoskeleton.  Since SPG3A, SPG4, and SGP31 account for well over 50% of all HSP cases, we suggest ER network defects as the predominant neuropathologic mechanism for the HSPs.  This is supported by the identification of numerous other HSP proteins over the years that regulate ER morphology, including the CPT1C protein (in collaboration with Dr. Kurt Fischbeck).     Over the past year, we have continued to develop animal models for SPG31 (knock out) and SPG3A (knockout and knock in), as well as double mutant mice, to evaluate the extent of ER morphology changes using both in vivo and ex vivo studies.  We are employing both high-throughput FIB-SEM electron microscopy and super-resolution confocal microscopy to examine the changes in tubular ER within neuronal axons in response to these genetic manipulations, with detailed analysis using machine learning.   In addition, we have identified interactions of these proteins with several other proteins mutated in the HSPs, expanding the number of HSP cases related to defects in ER network formation.  Furthermore, we are actively generating in situ models for many of the HSPs through the production of patient-derived, induced pluripotent stem cells that are then differentiated into telecephalic neurons, in collaboration with Dr. Xue-Jun Li. Several of these studies were published in 2014 in the journals Stem Cells and Human Molecular Genetics.  ER morphology, dynamics and organelle contacts in these and other cells are being evaluated using a number of emerging super-resolution microscopy techniques an in vitro assays in collaboration with Drs. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, Antonina Roll-Mecak, and Harald Hess; some of this work was published in Science in 2016, and additional studies in this exciting area have been submitted and will be published shortly. Finally, we are working with Dr. Niamh O'Sullivan on fly models of these HSPs, focusing on the SPG61 protein ARL6IP1.   A key aspect of ER function possibly related to disease pathogenesis is the formation of lipid droplets, and this is an area of emphasis for our cellular and organismal studies.  We are in the process of completing several studies tying changes in ER morphology to alterations in lipid droplet biogenesis.  As part of these studies, we have used CRISPR technologies to knock out all three atlastin isoforms from cell lines such as HeLa and NIH-3T3.  We have also utilized advanced imaging techniques such as CT scans and MR spectroscopy to study changes in fat tissue in HSP mouse models non-invasively; one such study was published in Hum Mol Genet in 2016. Currently, we are collaborating with Dr. Lippincott-Schwartz and colleagues assessing the role of the SPG4 protein spastin in lipid droplet biogenesis and interactions, and a recent study was published in the J Cell Biol in 2019. Collectively, these studies were also the inspiration for the planning of a large clinical natural history trial in patients with the three most common forms of autosomal dominant HSP (SPG4, SPG3A, and SPG31), which has been recruiting subjects for the past two years.         Taken together, we expect that our studies will advance our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the HSPs.  Such an understanding at the molecular and cellular levels will hopefully lead to novel treatments to prevent the progression of these disorders. n/a",ER Network Shaping Mechanisms in the Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias,10259354,ZIANS002992,"['ATP phosphohydrolase', 'Affect', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biogenesis', 'Breathing', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Family', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genets', 'Goals', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Hela Cells', 'Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Situ', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Membrane', 'Microscopy', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphology', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Natural History', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Organelles', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Spastic Paraplegia', 'Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary, Autosomal Dominant', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'axonopathy', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'fly', 'functional group', 'gene product', 'genetic manipulation', 'genomic locus', 'hereditary neuropathy', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'spastin', 'stem cells', 'structural biology', 'trafficking']",NINDS,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,ZIA,2020,2562366,0.06679556469288245
"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,9848587,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,317007,0.11023408797719611
"Integrating experiment and theory for predicting protein folding pathways and structure Project Summary/Abstract  Protein folding and dynamics are integral to many biological activities, including chaperone action, degradation, amyloid diseases and aging. Our goal is to combine experimental and computational studies to produce a predictive understanding of protein dynamics through the development of methods capable of simulating folding and dynamics just using physio-chemical principles. Our past studies have focused on single domain proteins. Our efforts have expanded to more complicated systems including the snow flea anti-freeze protein (sfAFP) and TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) that are relevant to iron sequestration in pathogenic bacteria. Tying these studies together is our new molecular dynamics (MD) package, Upside, which can reversibly fold some proteins up to 97 AA to under 4 Å Cα-RMSD in cpu-days without the use of fragments, homology or evolution. Upside utilizes a number of unique features, including rapid side chain packing that enables simulations using only 3 backbone atoms while retaining considerable detail and avoiding side chain “rattling”, which slows all-atom methods. We will improve Upside and implement enhanced sampling methods to increase our accuracy and size range, and study protein dynamics as monitored by hydrogen exchange.  sfAFP's unique structure challenges conventional wisdom regarding cooperative folding and stability. Lacking a hydrophobic core to promote folding, other factors must contribute to sfAFP's stability. We will test our quantum calculations that sfAFP's H-bonds are unusually stable by measuring amide H/D fractionation factors and NMR J-couplings. We will evaluate whether intrinsic biases in backbone dihedral angles for the PP2 basin in the unfolded state are another major stabilizing factor. This information will be used to improve the Upside simulations. Finally, we will apply our standard folding tools to characterize the folding pathway and compare it to the behavior we expect based on principles derived from proteins with hydrophobic cores.  Many aspects of the transport cycle in TBDT remain unknown despite protracted study, including the conformational rearrangement of the plug domain during transport. We will provide the first structure of the plug domain outside the barrel, and so answer whether this structure matches the crystal structure in the barrel. Additionally, the study of Nakamoto's V10C-S120C variant of the BtuB plug enables the investigation of a possible folding or transport intermediate. We will characterize the plug's dynamics while it is in the barrel using HX to observe possible transport-competent states. The mechanism of plug folding and insertion into the barrel will be investigated, with comparative studies for FhuA, a TBDT whose plug domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. These studies represent an exciting combination of protein folding and function, at the interface between soluble and membrane folding, using experiments and complementary folding simulations. Project Narrative We are combining experimental and computational approaches to produce a predictive understanding of protein folding and dynamics. Our focus has expanded to more complicated systems, including an anti-freeze protein and the plug domain of the TonB-dependent transporters involved in pathogenic bacterial iron sequestration.

"Centrosome Duplication and Maturation As a non-membrane bound organelle, the assembly of centrosomes must be driven by PPIs. These interactions are likely modified by highly regulated changes in protein binding affinity in a cell-type and cell-cycle dependent manner, which can in turn modulate centrosome behavior and function. We have focused on identifying PPIs among a core set of conserved centrosome proteins, classified as proteins of the centriole, the PCM and regulatory kinases. Previous high-throughput and small-scale interactions studies have suggested that there might be a limited number of PPIs among centrosome proteins and have raised the possibility that few interactions are used to construct a simple, ultimately static structure. Our data does not support this simplistic view of the centrosome. We have uncovered a large number of direct PPIs, dramatically expanding our understanding of the centrosome interaction landscape. This highly interconnected landscape suggests a much more complex centrosome assembly and regulatory process, which we suggest can be leveraged to perform a variety of specialized tasks dictated by a broad spectrum of cellular requirements.   In previous years we have focused our attention on Pericentrin-Like-Protein (PLP), Asterless (Asl), Cep135, and the critical centriole duplication kinase Plk4. In the past year, we have focused on the role of Ana2 and Sas4 in regulating Plk4. In a collaborative effort with the lab of Greg Rogers at the University of Arizona, we showed that one of the earliest stages of centriole duplication begins by the binding of Ana2 to the Sas4 G-box, when then enables hyperphosphorylation of the Ana2 N terminus by Plk4. Hyperphosphorylation increases the affinity of the Ana2G-box interaction, and, consequently, promotes the accumulation of Ana2 at the procentriole to induce daughter centriole formation. Thus, this study discovered a conserved and earliest step in centriole assembly.  Key to uncovering the interaction of Ana2 and Sas4, was a novel screen developed in our lab to identify proteins that form stable binary complexes. 17 centrosome genes were selected for analysis, including Sas4, Plk4, and Ana2. FL genes and fragments were randomly inserted into a bacterial dual-tag expression plasmid where one component is tagged with either His6 and the other with GFP. In brief, bacterial lysates were subjected to a two-step affinity-purification scheme to isolate protein complexes. From 992 isolated bacterial colonies, we identified 90 bacterial lysates containing both His6 and GFP proteins. False-positive dual-tagged single proteins were eliminated by PCR analysis, as well as duplicate dual protein expression vectors, leaving a possible 48 positive interactors. Binding was further tested by scaling up the cultures and using a secondary screen consisting of tandem His6 pulldown followed by GFP IP, resulting in 21 positive interactions. These interactions were subjected to a final GFP IP step to test for reciprocal binding, yielding six high-confidence interactors. These included (1) the central Plk4 Polo box (PB) cassette PB1-PB2 with itself, (2) PB1-PB2 and the N terminus of Asl, and (3) NT and C-terminal fragments of Ana2; all three are well-described interactions that validated our screen. Remarkably, we also identified the Sas4 G-box as another PB1-PB2 binding partner as well as an interaction between the G-box and a C-terminal fragment of Ana2 lacking the previously described G-boxbinding motif. (An interaction between the Ana2 N terminus and Cnn was also detected but is not examined further in this study.) We note that G-box/PB1-PB2 binding was not preserved during the tandem GFP-IP step of the screen, indicating that this interaction is weaker compared with the other interactors. This novel screen or randomly assembled complexes continues to guide additional project on centriole assembly in our lab. n/a",Centrosome Duplication and Maturation,10253857,ZIAHL006104,"['Affinity', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Architecture', 'Arizona', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemistry', 'C-terminal', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Centrioles', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Daughter', 'Drosophila genus', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Interphase', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Microcephaly', 'Microscopy', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Mutation', 'Organelles', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Plasmids', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Procentriole', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'bacterial lysate', 'cell type', 'expression vector', 'human disease', 'novel', 'pericentrin', 'protein complex', 'protein expression', 'scale up']",NHLBI,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",ZIA,2020,767910,0.054957796989316215
"Tissue-specific protein interactome mapping in a vertebrate embryo Abstract Proteins rarely act in isolation, but rather function in multi-protein complexes. Accordingly, protein-protein interactomes are exceptionally valuable resources that provide deep mechanistic insights and generate myriad hypotheses. Current methods for interactome mapping, such as affinity purification mass-spectrometry (APMS), are extremely difficult to deploy in vivo, so little comprehensive interactome data yet exists for developing embryos and even less for specific tissues within embryos. This fact poses an especially acute problem for understanding highly dynamic processes in which post-transcriptional controls dominate, for example collective cell movements. Here, we will use tissue engaged in convergent extension, a crucial collective movement that elongates the axis of animal embryos, to test the efficacy of new label-free interactome mapping approaches. Successful completion of the project will therefore be significant both for developing broadly applicable new methods and also for providing systems-level insights into a disease- relevant, vertebrate collective cell movement. Project Narrative: This study centers on developing novel methods for systematically identifying protein-protein interactions in embryos. To explore the utility of the method, we focus our efforts on proteins involved in collective cell movements called convergent extension, which are governed by the planar cell polarity (or PCP) proteins. These experiments will be significant because defects in PCP proteins or convergent extension lead to “neural tube defects” such as spina bifida and anencephaly, as well as congenital skeletal dysplasias.",Tissue-specific protein interactome mapping in a vertebrate embryo,10104048,R21HD103882,"['Actomyosin', 'Acute', 'Adhesions', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Amphibia', 'Anencephaly and spina bifida X linked', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Cadherins', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Fractionation', 'Genetic', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mesoderm', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Neural Tube Closure', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rana', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Spectrometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'base', 'cell motility', 'convergent extension', 'data integration', 'efficacy testing', 'embryo tissue', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'novel', 'planar cell polarity', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'skeletal dysplasia', 'success', 'vertebrate embryos']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2020,237750,0.046098989728142
"Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences PROJECT SUMMARY This study investigates the specificity of farnesyl transferase (FTase) that isoprenylates CaaX proteins. Studies probing the in vivo activity of the FTase have historically used reporters (e.g. Ras GTPases) that undergo complex multi-step post-translational modification (PTM), involving initial farnesylation followed by CaaX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. This study takes advantage of Hsp40 Ydj1, a farnesylation-only reporter for which we have developed a range of methods to monitor its PTM status. Its use reveals that farnesylation is not necessarily coupled to subsequent PTMs as has been generally accepted for CaaX proteins, and that FTase specificity is significantly more promiscuous than anticipated. These findings challenge the conventional paradigm for how farnesylated proteins are modified and which proteins are targeted by FTase. We will extend our studies to fully resolve the specificity of FTase using a combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical studies. We bring to bear on our investigations an exceptionally strong set of preliminary findings, the complementary expertise of several research groups, and a comprehensive molecular toolbox for the study of farnesylated proteins and other enzymes associated with this post-translational modification pathway. PROJECT NARRATIVE Farnesylated proteins are intimately involved in disease. This project investigates the target specificity of the farnesyl transferase that mediates protein farnesylation. Our results are expected to help shape ongoing efforts aimed at targeting the farnesyl transferase for therapeutic benefit in a variety of diseases.",Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences,10019396,R01GM132606,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Belief', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'CENP-E protein', 'Charge', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cysteine', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Monitor', 'Nuclear Lamin', 'Online Systems', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Pheromone', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Protein Farnesylation', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ursidae Family', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biophysical analysis', 'farnesylation', 'genetic selection', 'in vivo', 'isoprenylation', 'next generation sequencing', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'protein farnesyltransferase', 'protein function', 'protein geranylgeranyltransferase', 'protein protein interaction', 'ras-Related G-Proteins']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,390494,0.08897812850351317
"A New Pradigm for the Rational Expression of Integral Membrane Proteins ABSTRACT Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are of both fundamental scientific and medical importance, because they govern the flow of nutrients and information across cell membranes and because they comprise the largest class of therapeutic drug targets. However, the structural and biophysical characterization of IMPs lags far behind that of other protein classes, due to the inability to reliably produce significant quantities of IMPs for experimental studies. The fundamental gap in knowledge is that no framework currently exists for understanding the connection between the amino-acid and nucleotide sequence of an IMP and its expression level, and the fundamental gap in technology is that no successful strategies exist for the general prediction and improvement IMP expression levels. The current work will remove these fundamental gaps in knowledge and technology via the innovative combination of (i) experimental methods to characterize IMP expression levels, spanning across multiple protein families and expression systems, (ii) rigorous data-driven strategies to disentangle the role of diverse IMP sequence properties on expression, and (iii) coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to enable the simulation - on unbiased biological timescales - of key mechanistic steps that act as bottlenecks to IMP expression. The proposed collaboration of the Miller and Clemons laboratories at Caltech is uniquely positioned to succeed in this effort, creating the opportunity for a new paradigm for the rational expression of IMPs. Success of the proposed research will have transformational impact by providing powerful and accessible computational tools for increased IMP expression to the research community, by advancing the fundamental characterization of this large and important class of proteins, and by accelerating medical and pharmaceutical applications. NARRATIVE The largest class of molecules targeted by therapeutic drugs are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), which are central to biology as they facilitate the delivery of nutrients and information across cellular membranes; yet their biophysical characterization has been slow due to the difficulty of reliably producing significant quantities for experimental studies. The proposed work aims to bridge a fundamental gap in knowledge by identifying the connection between the genetically encoded sequence of an IMP and the amount that can be produced.

"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments.

The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives. The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program plans to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG.

"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month.

"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine. Our fourth aim describes the production of the resource to ensure that our data is freely available according to the FAIR principles. UniProt forms a foundation for hundreds of life sciences data resources. Continuous software development is needed to ensure delivery of this key component of the life science infrastructure. The UniProt website is used by hundreds of thousands of scientists every month. The final aim describes how we will enable this community to make best use of UniProt, through user training, outreach and improved user interfaces, driven by user testing.

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance. Funding of this proposal will allow us to provide research results, as well as high-quality data and software for the identification of transporter proteins useful to scientists whose investigations focus on health issues.",The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB),9895808,R01GM077402,"['Activator Appliances', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Island', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Ontology', 'Organelles', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Production', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transmembrane Transport', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Xenobiotics', 'base', 'data pipeline', 'drug development', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'member', 'metagenome', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'protein transport', 'screening', 'text searching', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'whole genome', 'willingness']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,315000,0.08281083732056167
"Structural data science methods and software to study immunotherapeutic proteins We have developed a highly efficient interactive web-based software for molecular visualization and structural analysis (iCn3D) Wang et al. 2020] through an initial collaboration with the NCBI structure group. We successfully applied the software to study the structure and interactions of viral proteins with cell surface receptors [Youkharibache et al. 2020]. The iCn3D software is now becoming a collaborative research platform as demonstrated by our recent sequence-structure analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and other beta coronaviruses where we identified specific sequence-structure micro-homologies in receptor binding domains/motifs (RBD/RBM) supersecondary structures of coronaviruses from SARS to MERS, OC43, HKU1, HKU4, and MHV [Youkharibache et al. 2020] for targeting by neutralizing antibodies or other therapeutic molecules. While performing this analysis, we also proposed structure corrections that were hiding sequence homologies, demonstrating the value of an integrated analysis approach to improve structures. We have implemented an innovative data sharing capability through a F.A.I.R mechanism in iCn3D. In fact, we go further than data sharing, as entire analysis protocols are embedded in sharable permanent links for reproducibility, extensibility, and collaborative research. As the software becomes cross-disciplinary, it is also becoming a platform to integrate diverse data streams. Software development itself is evolving into a collaborative, open-source hub with new development groups joining in from both in the intramural and extramural community, and collectively reaching out to a broader developers' community through hackathons [https://www.iscb.org/ismb2020-program/ismb2020-hackathon], co-organized with intramural and extramural collaborators. The fundamental basis of my research has been the study of self-association determinants of molecular systems, especially proteins, as revealed by their structural symmetries at several levels of molecular organization [Youkharibache 2019; Youkharibache, Tran, and Abrol 2020]. The software we are developing to study molecular interactions and the applications we are now tackling are beginning to capture this vision and we are exploring the initial implementations of symmetry analysis as a data organizing mechanism, aiming at developing therapeutics based on molecular interactions knowledge. For example, while antibodies' heavy and light chain symmetries are well known, the individual Immunoglobulin domains consist themselves of intrinsically pseudo-symmetric protodomains [Youkharibache 2019], a property largely ignored that can open new routes to antibody engineering, especially nanobodies. At the same time, many of the cell surface protein receptors, from T-cells to their target cells (TCRs, CD4, CD8, CD28, CTLA4, PD1, PDL1, etc.) are composed of Ig domains interacting through oligomeric pseudo-symmetric arrangements revealing the determinants of protein domain association, and Ig domains in particular. We are assembling an Ig-centric database that will provide invaluable data to design new Ig-based immunoreceptors and inhibitors. The Ig-domain is by far the most common structural fold of the immunome, and its pseudo symmetric assembly patterns are an invaluable guide to understand and design inhibitors and modulators. There are, however, other important folds on cell surfaces: GPCRs, MFS, SLCs, etc. that are used as receptors for immune cell interactions, metabolic modulations, or for viral entry. We have demonstrated that a wide range of polytopic membrane proteins, including GPCRs and SLCs, are indeed formed through a pseudo-symmetric assembly mechanism [Youkharibache, Tran, and Abrol 2020]. Second, to Ig-based proteins, GPCRs represent the most important subset of molecular scaffolds in the cell surfaceome/immunome, and SLCs are also high up in the list. We had established earlier that protein domains' pseudo symmetries are found in 20% of known structures overall, yet quasi-symmetry is found in higher proportion in integral membrane proteins [Youkharibache, Tran, and Abrol 2020], and we are now seeing an even higher percentage across the proteins of the surfaceome, especially on immune cells. Our symmetry analysis gives us a decoding framework to study molecular interactions, and we are actively developing methods and databases that can enable the design of new Ig-based receptors as anti-cancer therapeutics based on these ideas. The characterization of anti-CD19 and anti-BCMA CARs based on flexibility analysis have enabled us to support observations in ongoing clinical trials [Brudno et al. 2020]; at the same time, we have observed the formation of a spontaneous rearrangement of a CAR-T scFv in a crystal [PDBid: 7JO8 Cheung et al. 2020] mediated by quasi-symmetry of Ig domains association [Youkharibache 2019]. We are currently developing an algorithm to detect and characterize flexible parts of proteins and protein complexes to study protein folding and unfolding, conformational changes, and, most importantly, for some of our applications to relate flexibility to their underlying sequence-structure determinants. We are also developing an annotated Immunoproteins database regrouping all known structures containing Immunoglobulin domains in interaction to study the interfaces at the heart of immune synapses between cells, and primarily involving T-cells and their receptors. n/a",Structural data science methods and software to study immunotherapeutic proteins,10262834,ZIHBC012005,"['2019-nCoV', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Transporter', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Therapy', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'CCL21 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD28 gene', 'CD8B1 gene', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coronavirus', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Endogenous Retroviruses', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Extramural Activities', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Group Structure', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Domain', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integral Membrane Protein', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nutrient', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Retroviridae', 'Route', 'Sequence Homology', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'computational platform', 'data sharing', 'data streams', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'diverse data', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'hackathon', 'immunological synapse', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'molecular subtypes', 'nanobodies', 'neutralizing antibody', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'scaffold', 'scientific computing', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'structured data', 'tool']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIH,2020,114404,0.05721463395605269
