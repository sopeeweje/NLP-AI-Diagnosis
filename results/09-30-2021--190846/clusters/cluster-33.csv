"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology and cognition PROGRAM SUMMARY The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU's unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook's AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. PROJECT NARRATIVE This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, bridging basic neuroscience and clinical research on mental disorders.

"Biomedical Informatics Training at Stanford Biomedical Informatics Training at Stanford 7. Project Summary/Abstract: The opportunities for creating new methods to advance biomedical discovery are unprecedented. Since 1982, the Stanford Biomedical Informatics (BMI) training program has granted PhD and MS degrees to students with intensive training that prepares them for careers in research. It now benefits from the creation of a new Department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford, for which it will be the primary graduate training program. The formal BMI curriculum consists of (1) Core BMI, (2) Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics and Engineering, (3) Ethical, Social, Legal Implications of technology, and (4) Domain biology or medicine. The curriculum is appropriate for research training in Translational Bioinformatics (TB, including environmental exposure informatics), Health care/clinical informatics (HC), and Clinical Research Informatics (CR). Stanford's research milieu provides outstanding opportunities for informatics research. We are in the 32nd year as an NLM-supported training program, with approximately 80 current students (33 PhD, 12 research MS, 28 Co-terminal MS, and 12 Professional (distance) MS). We have produced 150 PhD graduates and 75 MS research graduates, more than 50% of whom have been NLM-supported. In this proposal, we request annual support for training 11 pre-doctoral candidates (including two environmental exposure informatics slots), 6 postdoctoral candidates, and 4 short-term diversity. We receive more than 200 applicants per year for our PhD and MS program. We are evolving our curriculum to respond to new opportunities in big data, statistics and machine learning, and are focusing increasingly on individual advising and career mentorship as the diversity of opportunities for our graduates explodes. The BMI program will continue to produce leaders in academic and industrial biomedical informatics, and will prepare them to conduct biomedical informatics research that advances human health.

"Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design Project Summary/Abstract The next generation of bioengineering and biomedical researchers will have unprecedented access to technologies including wireless health, big data, genetic sequencing, and machine learning approaches to enable modern diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. This presents individuals trained at the interface of technology and biomedicine with an enormous opportunity to address the world’s needs in health and medicine. In the Bioengineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles, we aim to develop students into leaders able to seamlessly identify clinical needs that technology can address, design and validate solutions that address these needs, communicate with a variety of stakeholders to build teams invested in problem-oriented solutions, and to navigate the regulatory and commercial pathways necessary to enable their technologies to thrive. The Bioengineering Capstone Series at UCLA leverages resources available at UCLA to enable students to: 1) gain insight into clinical needs directly from clinicians and educators across the Ronald Reagan Medical Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and UCLA Health System, 2) design their solutions through mentorship from engineering professors, 3) understand the complexities of the biomedical industry with support from the UCLA Technology Development Group and members of the Department of Engineering Industry Advisory Board, 4) utilize modern technologies in wireless health and data science by collaborating with the Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data- to-Knowledge (MD2K) and Mobile Health (mHealth) Institute at UCLA, and 5) work with the National Science Foundation Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations Engineering Research Center (NSF PATHS- UP ERC) to learn to target and communicate their technologies to maximize societal benefits. Statement of Public Health Relevance: To prepare the next generation of engineers with skills in the design of therapeutics and medical devices, this research education program will provide bioengineering students at UCLA with enhanced opportunities to engage in real world design for biomedical applications. We will guide students through the medical design process from identifying needs, creating solutions which address these needs, and communicating the significance of their contributions to the greater community, ultimately yielding a larger pool of well-trained engineers to address biomedical challenges. !",Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design,9709138,R25EB027626,"['Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Technology', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High School Student', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intellectual Property', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modernization', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'STEM field', 'School Dentistry', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education research', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'product development', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'skills', 'technology development', 'undergraduate student']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R25,2019,21600,0.01319778961472939
"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity. Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States. The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments. At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs. TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics, computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding; they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate summer fellows. Project Narrative Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use, understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems.

"An Interdisciplinary Program for Advanced Training in Health Data Analytics The proposed training program adds predoctoral and postdoctoral training to the Carolina Health Informatics Program (CHIP), which concentrates on both advancing research and training in biomedical and health informatics. CHIP is a truly interdisciplinary program co- created and co-sponsored by 1) School of Medicine, 2) Gillings School of Global Public Health, 3) School of Nursing, 4) Eshelman School of Pharmacy, 5) School of Dentistry, 6) School of Information & Library Science, and 7) Computer Science Department of the College of Arts & Sciences. The program is further strengthened by close partnerships with area health care organizations and companies specializing in biopharmaceuticals, heath care, IT and analytics. Recognizing the many challenges associated with health data analytics and use, the three foundational aspects of the CHIP training programs are: 1) Methods for health data analytics, 2) Building powerful interactive analytics systems that allow customization and support decision making for a wide variety of health care operations, and 3) Addressing translational challenges in implementing and managing information systems that leverage health data analytics effectively. Given that CHIP is a highly interdisciplinary program, it will draw upon its diverse faculty, research centers, laboratories, and other rich resources to develop three major types of activities as part of the proposed advanced predoctoral and postdoctoral training program. The three activities are: 1) Research methods and analytics techniques for clinical data science, imaging informatics, precision medicine, and big data analytics for population health, 2) Didactic learning based on courses in machine learning, biostatistics, big data management, and visual analytics and additional courses that are rooted in realistic health care problems, and 3) Large- scale, population-oriented system development, deployment, and outcome evaluation. Improving human health by leveraging health data analytics demands that the critical problems and development of solutions are approached from a broad perspective, carefully taking into account evidence ranging from molecular-scale to population-scale and drawing upon knowledge from biostatistics, information science, and computing. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's CHIP program encompasses and leverages seven different academic units and it builds upon a five-year legacy to expand its offerings to train next generation health informatics researchers, academics, and leaders.",An Interdisciplinary Program for Advanced Training in Health Data Analytics,9735423,T15LM012500,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Products', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Custom', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Gills', 'Healthcare', 'Information Sciences', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Library Science', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Pharmacy Schools', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'School Dentistry', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Science', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Visual', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'college', 'computer science', 'data management', 'faculty research', 'health care service organization', 'health data', 'imaging informatics', 'medical schools', 'operation', 'population health', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'precision medicine', 'programs']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,T15,2019,376089,0.07017918051587248
"NRSA Training This revised CTSA Institutional Training Core (TL1) has been designed to leverage the strengths of The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), the umbrella organization that will provide an infrastructure to support and enhance clinical and translational research and training in New Jersey. Led by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS) and administered by the Rutgers Institute for Translational Medicine and Science (RITMS), NJ ACTS comprises an Alliance of three universities (Rutgers University, Princeton University, and the New Jersey Institute of Technology) and community-based organizations, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, data centers and two Health Information Exchanges. This unique and dynamic environment will allow us to create a robust and effective platform to train the next generation of translational researchers. Innovative translational research can neither be taught nor accomplished in a silo. We want to encourage our trainees to consider, from the earliest stages of their doctoral experience, the implication and application of their research efforts to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. To accomplish this, rather than limit our training within a particular department or program, we have gathered an initial cohort of highly productive mentors with proven expertise in basic biomedical and bioengineering research, clinical research, bioinformatics, biostatistics, machine learning, epidemiology, health policy and other key areas that will coalesce to provide mentorship to our trainees. Our cross-disciplinary team has been united as the “NJ ACTS Academy of Mentors” which will be the educational platform for this TL1 training effort. To enhance the translational nature of this experience, the Academy of Mentors will be shared by both our NJ ACTS Trainees (TL1) and Scholars (KL2). Strategically, we will focus on a trainee pool composed of students who have expressed, by choice of degree(s) and/or graduate program, an interest in translating basic science findings and concepts into disease-relevant applications (MD/PhD.

"Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of newly emerging computational tools for data science, biostatisticians need to play a fundamental role in health sciences research. There is an urgent need to encourage US Citizens and Permanent Residents to pursue graduate training in biostatistics. The design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials and observational studies; the setting of regulatory policy; and the conception of laboratory experiments have been shaped by the fundamental contributions of biostatisticians for decades. Advances in genomics, medical imaging technologies, and computational biology; the increasing emphasis on precision and evidence-based medicine; and the widespread adoption of electronic health records; demand the skills of biostatisticians trained to collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary environment and to develop statistical and machine learning methods to address the challenges presented by this data-rich revolutionary era of health sciences research. The proposed summer program which includes world-renowned clinical scientists and biostatisticians from two local universities, will provide an immense opportunity for student participants to learn basic yet modern statistical methods that are critical to uncovering new insights from such big and complex biomedical data and also illustrate the potential pitfalls of confounding and bias that may arise when analyzing biomedical data. A unique feature of the proposed training program is thus to expose the participants to not only basic statistical methods but also to the topics of computer science and bioinformatics which will be invaluable in creating the multidisciplinary teams required to tackle the complex research questions that often requires multipronged approaches. The proposed six-week training program will be structured around the NIH's Translation Science Spectrum and will introduce participants to opportunities in biostatistics through the lens of the science advanced by the contributions of biostatisticians. Following an initial set of weeks on basic training of biostatistical methods, the program will culminate in a data hack-a-thon style competition in which participants will employ the statistical and scientific knowledge gained during the program to produce the most innovative, statistically-sound, scientifically-relevant and effectively-communicated response to a set of research questions. The proposed research education program will enroll up to 20 such participants from across the nation and, through lectures, field trips, and opportunities to analyze data from real health sciences, inspire them to pursue graduate training. The program will draw upon considerable past collaborations and complementary resources of two local world-renowned universities to provide participants with an unparalleled view of the field, including award-winning instructors, internationally known methodological and clinical researchers, and a local area rich in opportunities to showcase careers in biostatistics. Special efforts will be made to enroll participants from underrepresented groups. Participants will be followed after completion, and the numbers attending graduate school in statistics and pursuing biostatistics careers will be documented. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are indispensible contributors to health sciences research. The demand for professionals with advanced training in biostatistics is high and will continue to increase, especially with the expanding challenges posed by big biomedical data. This six week summer research education program, a joint effort of North Carolina State University and Duke University, will enroll up to 20 US citizen/permanent resident participants from across the nation in the summers of 2020-2022 and expose them to the opportunities presented by careers in biostatistics and encourage them to seek graduate training in the field.",Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences,9734597,R25HL147228,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Names', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Talents', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'education research', 'experience', 'field trip', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'investigator training', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'lens', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health research', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'statistics', 'summer institute', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2019,249789,0.07291678141476966

"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9852112,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,413898,0.06666066649484644
"Computationally Enabled Integrative Neuroscience Summary / Abstract ! The Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) Graduate Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) proposes the “Computationally-Enabled Integrative Neuroscience” (CEIN) predoctoral training program. Tremendous advances in the field of neuroscience are beginning to enable an integrated understanding of the brain. A convergence of new tools and methods, from optogenetics to CLARITY to CRISPR to deep neural network modeling and machine learning, is providing the means to address problems that once seemed intractable. MIT's BCS department is ideally organized to promote interdisciplinary, integrative training and research in neuroscience and behavior, combining the empirical power of modern molecular, cellular, systems and behavioral methods, with the theoretical and model-building strength of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. With world-renowned faculty and access to state-of-the-art equipment, CEIN trainees will be poised to lead the next generation of basic and translational neuroscience. The proposed CEIN training program maintains BCS's longstanding strength of integrative training across levels of empirical analysis. In addition, the proposed program reflects significant evolution in our field: the increased importance of computation in both data analysis and complex model building, and the increased importance of professional skills for leadership. The CEIN training objectives are focused on three training pillars (1) advancing empirical methods and concepts at multiple levels of neuroscience (2) computational approaches to theory development and brain data analysis, and (3) professional skills such as grant-writing, oral presentations, and clinical connection. Supported by MIT's world-class facilities, resources, and faculty, predoctoral students will achieve these goals through comprehensive coursework, new modules for professional skills development, mentorship by experts in the field, and advanced research experience. The research of CEIN trainees will lead to profound new discoveries about brain function in health and its modes of failure in disease. Insights from CEIN laboratories will impact diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, Autism Spectrum Disorders, dyslexia, hearing loss, and many other disorders with increasing impact on heath in the United States. The CEIN program is focused on training students in their first two years of graduate school. Funds are requested for five years to support 11 predoctoral trainees per year. The CEIN training program would be the only foundational neuroscience predoctoral training program at MIT. Project Narrative ! The “Computationally-Enabled Integrated Neuroscience” (CEIN) training program will prepare the next generation of leaders in neuroscience at MIT. The program will train exceptional predoctoral students to integrate neuroscientific experimental methods and concepts across multiple levels of analysis, build precise quantitative models, adhere to the highest standards of methodological rigor, and translate fundamental discoveries about brain function to new treatments and therapies for neurological disorders. !",Computationally Enabled Integrative Neuroscience,9704719,T32NS105587,['Neurosciences'],NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,T32,2019,249704,0.14904292602478209

"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program. We aim to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by preparing PREP Scholars for the rigors and challenges of a biomedical doctoral degree program so that they will successfully obtain a PhD degree or MD/PhD degree and contribute their expertise to the biomedical scientific community.",LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences,9754847,R25GM121189,"['Academic Training', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data Analyses', 'Degree program', 'Dentistry', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Extramural Activities', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Historically Black Colleges and Universities', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Louisiana', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Enrollment', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Oral', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Study Skills', 'Sum', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'gulf coast', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'member', 'minority communities', 'novel', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'recruit', 'role model', 'science education', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student', 'university student']",NIGMS,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R25,2019,308173,0.11445169665147038
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9689119,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2019,423432,0.10228475983831398
"Advanced Graduate Training Program in Theoretical Neuroscience We are requesting the continuation of a training program in theoretical neuroscience with funds to support 4 predoctoral trainees. Our goal is to train students who combine exceptional skills in mathematics, statistics, modeling and machine learning with a deep understanding of neurobiology. The complexity of neural systems and of the data that we can now obtain demands researchers with these skills if we are to realize the neuroscience community's goals of achieving a mechanistic understanding of nervous system function and making significant progress in the treatment of neural disorders and mental illness. Training will occur at the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia University, supported by the 6 faculty at the Center, faculty visitors to the Center, and 26 other faculty from the Departments of Neuroscience, Psychology, Biology, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering, and Statistics at Columbia. The Theory Center provides an exceptional environment in which pre-doctoral, post-doctoral and faculty researchers interact and collaborate extensively both within the Center and with researchers in experimental laboratories. Most trainees are members of the Columbia graduate program in Neurobiology and Behavior (with a small number drawn from other graduate programs) and take the courses that satisfy the requirements of that program. The required courses are augmented by a large selection of electives, including courses in theoretical neuroscience, statistics and machine learning. The goal of this training program is twofold: 1) To produce theoreticians who combine outstanding skills in analysis and model-building with a deep understanding and ""sense"" of biological neuroscience; and 2) To train experimentalist who are skilled at applying theoretical and computational methods in their research. This will be accomplished through extensive collaborations with outstanding experimental laboratories both at Columbia and elsewhere combined with training in state-of-the art theoretical methods. Whenever possible, students will be co-advised by both a member of the Theory Center faculty and a researcher from our associated experimental faculty, and they will be given desk space both in the Theory Center and in the laboratory of their experimental co-advisor. The opportunity to be involved in the operations of an outstanding laboratory and in the activities and intellectual atmosphere of a world-class theory center provides an exceptional training experience. The complexity of neuroscience data and the challenges of understanding and treating diseases and dysfunctions of the brain demand an unprecedented level of sophistication in data analysis and modeling. The proposed training program provides two solutions to this challenge: training theorists who combine technical expertise with a deep understanding of experimental neuroscience and of how to work with experimentalists; and training experimentalists who know how to apply theoretical methods and work with theorists. People with these combined skills will be essential for progress in neuroscience in the coming years.",Advanced Graduate Training Program in Theoretical Neuroscience,9704968,T32NS064929,"['Neurosciences', 'Training Programs']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,T32,2019,191509,0.12719341089807756
"Training in Computational Neural Engineering The proposal initiates a new, innovative training program in Computational Neural Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University to train the next generation of researchers at the intersection of computational neuroscience, data science, and clinical neurophysiology. It addresses the opportunities provided by the explosion of tools for measurement and manipulation of nervous system function and the challenges posed by the growing threat of neurological diseases and disorders on an expanding senior population. The program leverages past successes in federally-funded training efforts that have helped to catalyze rapid and recent growth in research and education in Computational Neural Engineering across Emory and Georgia. Early exposure to the intersection of fields is critical to the program mission. Interdisciplinary training in the first two years of the PhD program will provide trainees with unique opportunities for training across axes that span basic to clinical neuroscience, and from neural engineering to computational neuroscience, data science, and machine learning. Two graduate students per will be recruited from the applicant pools for the Biomedical Engineering (GT and Emory), Bioengineering (GT), Electrical and Computer Engineering (GT), and Machine Learning PhD programs, which collectively enroll over 200 PhD students per year. None of the participating programs offer research rotations or funding in the first year of graduate school. We will support a total of four students per year over a five-year period, providing two years of support for two entering students per year. funding such support will help attract the highest quality students to the program, and offer trainees the unique opportunity to rotate through research labs and establish new collaborative research projects. In our prior training experience, such interactions have led to new collaborations funded through fellowships and new research grants. Didactic training will complement core training in each PhD program with existing and new courses in computational neuroscience, neuropathology and neuroengineering, and a new course providing students with an immersive clinical experience at the Emory Brain Health Center. Extracurricular training includes Innovation Forums for clinician/engineering interactions, and a wide variety of seminars, methods clinics, and journal clubs. Trainees will also be provided with professional development for this new generation of researchers, including training in leadership, mentorship, neuroethics, and public scholarship. Trainees will also learn the growing industry in neural engineering, and will have opportunities for internships. Importantly, with solid preliminary evidence for the success in all of these ventures, this program targets an imperative area for growth. Our program will train the next generation of researchers to overcome challenges posed by the growing threat of neurological diseases and disorders on an expanding senior population. The training focuses on leveraging the explosion of new tools for understanding nervous system function in combination with a clinical understanding of neurological conditions and advanced methods in computation, data science, and machine learning.

"Training in Complex Systems and Data Science Approaches Applied to the Neurobiology of Drug Use The purpose of this program is to train pre- and post-doctoral scholars in the application of complex systems and data science approaches to the neurobiology of substance abuse, with the dual strategies of: (1) training candidates with expertise in data science, applied mathematics, computer science, and complex systems to apply their skills to the neuroscience of addiction; and (2) training candidates pursuing addiction research from neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology and genetics in the theory and application of Big Data methods, including network analysis, machine learning algorithms, and Bayesian statistical models. Trainees will be paired across disciplines, and academic stages, for research collaboration and reciprocal tutoring to facilitate the development of proficiency in each trainee's new field. Each trainee will also be dual mentored, their secondary mentor being their partner's primary. Over its five-year duration, the program will provide three years of funding for each of five pairs of pre- and post-doctoral researchers, with an initial cohort of four (two pairs), and additional pairs entering in each of the middle three years. The core curriculum will incorporate: (1) the established complex systems and data science graduate certificate at the University of Vermont; (2) course work in neuroscience, psychology and addiction, including classes focused on developing human subjects research skills; as well as (3) specialized courses designed to directly and effectively bridge the gap between the core disciplines. Trainees will also attend a biweekly journal club and monthly seminar, led by senior participants in the program, to further support the acquisition of multidisciplinary research skills.  The overarching aim of the program is to produce researchers poised to apply state-of-the-art analytic tools to understand the neurobiology of drug abuse. The focus will be characterizing the neural substrates of addiction and other comorbid psychopathologies, always with an eye toward clinical application. Recent increases in the quantity and quality of large-sample, multi-modal datasets that address the neural, genetic and environmental substrates of addiction make this a propitious time for such a training program. Researchers at UVM are ideally suited to provide this training as there exist close links between addiction research, cognitive neuroscience, complex systems and data science, and the mentoring faculty have access to exceptional datasets that are ideal for interrogation with Big Data methods. Armed with coherent domain knowledge and practiced with advanced methods for complex systems, trainees will develop analysis pipelines that: (1) incorporate sophisticated aggregation of longitudinal and multi-modal datasets, including various neuroimaging modalities, genetic information, survey and clinical data; (2) harness the power of supercomputing and modern machine learning algorithms to step beyond linear and univariate effects; and (3) address questions of immediate clinical importance to substance abuse that can inform the determination of risk factors, treatment and intervention strategy, and policy decisions. The overarching aim of this training program is to produce substance abuse researchers well versed in the theory and application of state-of-the-art analytic tools for complex systems in the context of cognitive neuroscience broadly defined. The research focus is on characterizing the neural substrates of addiction, with natural extensions to the study of other psychopathologies, and all work undertaken will maintain an eye toward clinical application. Research results, methods and analysis pipelines developed by trainees and their mentors will be made publically available, and may inform the determination of risk factors, treatment and intervention strategy, and policy decisions made by public health professionals.!",Training in Complex Systems and Data Science Approaches Applied to the Neurobiology of Drug Use,9722208,T32DA043593,"['Complex', 'Data Science', 'Drug usage', 'Neurobiology', 'System', 'Training']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,T32,2019,250164,0.044996667657393206
"Biomedical Data Science Graduate Training at Stanford ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The expanded ability to collect data at all scales-molecular, cellular, tissue, organism and population-has created unparalleled opportunities for biomedical discovery. These opportunities cross all areas of research from basic science to clinical care. In response to these tremendously exciting emerging challenges in data science, Stanford University announced the creation of a new Department of Biomedical Data Science (DBDS) to begin in fall of 2015. Fundamental to the DBDS is bringing together faculty in (1) informatics and computer science, and (2) biostatistics and mathematical modeling, who work closely with a broad range of (3) biomedical science collaborators to advance knowledge. The Stanford Biomedical Informatics (BMI) training program is focused on the creation of new methods for the organization, analysis and modeling of biomedical data and knowledge. The BMI program has been a small interdisciplinary program at Stanford for more than 33 years; nonetheless, it has produced many leaders in biomedical informatics and data science. The BMI program will now have its administrative home in the DBDS, and will become the epicenter for biomedical data science training at Stanford. We are able quickly to respond to the shortage of trained scientists in biomedical data science because of a flexible curriculum, an unusually fertile set of course offerings, and a plethora of research opportunities. In this proposal, we outline a plan to engage faculty broadly across the University to create scalable mechanisms for training the next generation of biomedical data scientists, and creating a pathway for ""data science"" within the BMI program that stresses statistical reasoning, machine learning and data mining of biomedical data.

"Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics Project Summary We propose to continue the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) pre-doctoral training program at Harvard Medical School. Since its inception in 2000, this program has provided rigorous multidisciplinary education in genome sciences for those students with proven excellence in quantitative fields. The gap between the ability to generate large amounts genomic data and the ability to efficiently analyze and interpret them continues to grow. Our program aims to train multi-disciplinary investigators who are capable of both integrating the genome-scale technologies into their experimental investigations and synthesizing the resulting datasets into coherent knowledge frameworks and mathematical models. The BIG training program draws on three significant strengths of the local academic environment: the breadth of talented investigators at Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals and research institutes; the rich variety of quantitatively-oriented courses in bioinformatics and genomics offered at Harvard and MIT; and national leadership of BIG faculty in genome-scale disease research, including harnessing of genomic approaches to clinical applications. The BIG pre-doctoral curriculum includes the following: 1) courses in fundamentals of genetics and molecular biology, taken alongside graduate students in the biological sciences; 2) statistics and machine learning, with focus on their applications to population studies, clinical medicine and basic biology; 3) survey of the larger scope of biomedical sciences, including medical informatics and translational medicine. This training program will continue to produce leaders, both in academia and industry, who are using genomic sciences to advance biomedical research and its application to medicine. Project Narrative Integrating genomics into the practice of biomedical research and medicine is a primary goal of the National Human Genome Research Institute's strategic plan. The Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Program at Harvard Medical School meets this goal by providing students trained in the quantitative sciences the intellectual tools to integrate genomics with biomedical sciences, access to “big data” from genome sciences and healthcare systems, and faculty mentors who are experts in genomics and bioinformatics.

"Graduate Training in Computational and Systems Biology Project Summary The objective is to support a Computational Systems Biology training program (CSBTP) to train students to become leaders in biomedical research at the interface of biology, computation and engineering. The effort is centered in MIT's interdisciplinary predoctoral training program in Computational and Systems Biology (CSB), which is the primary training program at MIT for students interested in computational and systems biology and is the only program that emphasizes interdisciplinary training and research in the field. Program faculty are concentrated in the three founding departments – Biological Engineering (BE), Biology, and Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) – with additional involvement of faculty from other departments. Research interests of training faculty span a wide range of CSB-related areas, including Regulatory Genomics and Proteomics, Precision Medicine and Medical Genomics, Molecular Biophysics and Structural Biology, Biological Networks and Machine Learning, and Cancer Systems Biology. This proposal seeks to expand the pool of training faculty significantly, including 7 faculty newly hired in the past 5 years who have active research programs in the field. Students apply directly to the CSB Ph.D. program from their undergraduate or Master’s institution and receive multi- and inter-disciplinary training in the field of computational and systems biology. The proposal seeks funding for 10 predoctoral traineeships per year, enabling extended research rotations and participation in special program activities. Unique aspects of the program include: (a) unusually diverse collection of research areas across science and engineering, with highly collaborative interdisciplinary faculty; (b) a unique core of interdisciplinary classroom subjects that combine biology, engineering, statistics and computation; (c) intensive advising and multi-disciplinary thesis committees to optimize the training experience for students from diverse academic backgrounds; (d) an annual retreat with participation of students and faculty focusing on research, careers, and challenges to interdisciplinary research. Project Narrative Biological discovery is increasingly driven by large-scale generation and analysis of biomedical data, enabled by new technologies for sequencing, imaging and manipulating biological systems. We propose to train scientists who have interdisciplinary expertise in concepts, approaches and technologies from biology, computer science, and engineering.

"University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data for Genomics and Neuroscience ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Washington conducts world-class research in the development of big data analytics, as well as in many areas of biomedical research. However, most predoctoral students in biomedical science do not receive cutting-edge training in statistical and computational methods for big data. Furthermore, most predoctoral students in statistics and computing do not receive in-depth training in biomedical science. In short, the university currently lacks an integrated training program that spans computation, statistics, and biomedical science. Given the growing importance of big data across many areas of biomedical research, such an integrated program is critically needed.  In order to train a new generation of researchers with expertise in statistics, computing, and biomedical science, we propose the University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data from Genomics and Neuroscience (BDGN). This program will focus on two areas of biomedical science, both of which are characterized by huge amounts of data as well as extensive expertise at the University of Washington: genomics and neuroscience. The program will draw six predoctoral students per year from the following seven PhD programs: Applied Mathematics, Biology, Biostatistics, Computer Science & Engineering, Genome Sciences, Neuroscience, and Statistics. Trainees will be appointed to the training grant during their ﬁrst or second year of hD studies and will continue on the training grant for two years. They will take a rigorous curriculum that involves three courses in statistics, machine learning, and data science, and three courses in either genomics or neuroscience. Each trainee will be paired with two world-class faculty mentors: one specializing in either genomics or neuroscience, and a second specializing in the development of either computational or statistical methods for big data. Other key features of the training program include three one-quarter rotations, with at least one focusing on genomics or neuroscience and one focusing on statistical or computational methods, a summer internship program, opportunities to attend world-class summer courses run through UW programs, peer mentoring, seminars, journal clubs, and courses on reproducible research and on responsible conduct of research. All predoctoral trainees will leave the BDGN Training Program with a core set of skills and a common language required for generating, interpreting, and developing statistical and computational methods for big data from genomics or neuroscience.

"Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of our new, multidisciplinary institutional training program, based in the Schools of Medicine and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, is to train pre-doctoral engineering students and physician postdoctoral fellows in Neuroengineering and its clinical translation. Disorders of the nervous system, such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, depression, dementia, and head trauma, constitute 35% of all disease and disability, and the burden is rising. There is an explosion of promising therapies for these disorders in new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate neural circuits, but translating these therapies from the laboratory to patients is a challenge. It requires talented engineers educated in clinical science and technically proficient physicians who speak the same language. Together these investigators must navigate a complex scientific, regulatory, and clinical landscape. Despite the huge demand, few formal, interdisciplinary Neuroengineering training programs exist.  We propose a new program shared by the Penn Schools of Medicine and Engineering focused on Neuroengineering and Clinical Translation. Physician and Engineering trainees will together become fluent in cutting-edge technologies at the forefront of Neuroengineering, such as devices, neurostimulation, machine learning, and algorithm development; cloud computing, nanotechnology and materials science. They will innovate new therapies for human disease and gain a thorough understanding of the clinical, regulatory, and developmental environments necessary to safely bring new technologies to patients. The program's core is a group of collaborative, multidisciplinary faculty mentors in engineering and the clinical neurosciences. In addition to dedicated neuroengineering research, our training program includes: (1) a longitudinal mentored clinical experience for PhD candidates, (2) engineering lab immersion and tutorial for MD postdoctoral fellows, (3) formal courses and seminars in Engineering, Neuroscience and Medicine, (4) training in the proper conduct of research, and (5) workshops on professional and career development, including scientific writing, public presentations, grant writing, and laboratory management. The program will recruit from an excellent pool of ~50 MD fellows and 80-90 PhD students each year. This effort formalizes a collaboration that has trained an impressive array of Neuroengineering investigators over the past twelve years. The program, unique at Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment, including a compact campus where robust centers for Engineering, Medicine and Neuroscience all reside within two blocks of each other, united through Penn's new Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics.

"Medical Imaging Informatics Training Grant ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) With the “digital era of biomedicine” upon us, exciting opportunities arise to revolutionize how we perform scien- tific research and deliver healthcare. Burgeoning areas like precision medicine foreshadow a transformation of how we understand disease and its individually-tailored treatment. In this context, the importance of imaging continues to grow, both as a driver of new knowledge and as a vital tool which uses these insights towards better detection, diagnosis, and treatment for patients. But achieving the full promise of this future still requires over- coming many barriers, and new imaging informaticians must be equipped with the cutting-edge skills that will create and support the necessary computational advances and methods. The UCLA Medical Imaging Informatics (MII) training program aims to be a leader in training this next generation of imaging informaticians who will develop the needed computational approaches and applications that enable this future. Bringing together leading experts from across our institution in imaging, engineering (computer and data science, electrical, bioengineering), (bio)statistics, and medicine, MII envisions an environment fostering interdisciplinary teaching and mentoring of students; and promoting innovative research throughout the spectrum of imaging informatics. MII's training program involves a comprehensive 1-year core curriculum introducing foun- dational principles of the discipline, forming a breadth of understanding while reinforcing the technical proficien- cies needed by any imaging informatician. Students complete coursework covering topics presented from the perspective of medical imaging and healthcare, including: information architectures; data and knowledge repre- sentation; data mining; machine learning; biostatistics; and information retrieval. Cross-cutting topics (e.g., radi- ogenomics, multimodal data integration and biomarker development) are presented throughout these courses. In parallel to the core curriculum, students are immediately engaged in research, completing rotations with faculty to gain an appreciation for contemporary imaging informatics projects. With this experience, PhD students sub- sequently specialize via more advanced elective coursework customized to their particular research interests. Students are challenged to propose, develop, and test new imaging informatics methods that will advance the discipline, as well as ultimately change and affect healthcare. Importantly, both training and research are inter- woven within a biomedical application domain and with appropriate PhD and MD mentorship to ensure compu- tational/informatics, clinical, and real-world translational insights and guidance. Recognizing the evolving land- scape of the biomedical workforce, our T32 includes a number of professional development activities, including internships, providing practical (research) experiences in different settings. Through the experiences gained dur- ing this T32 training program, MII students will become independent scientists, prepared to contribute to and lead imaging informatics as it continues to grow. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The UCLA Medical Imaging Informatics (MII) training program aims to train and inspire a new generation of imaging informaticians who will lead the development of innovative approaches that inform and enable precision medicine. MII establishes a cross-campus, interdisciplinary environment to teach and mentor future scientists in cutting-edge computational and data science methods towards imaging; and creates novel, team science re- search opportunities in which graduate students work and learn from leading experts in the field.

"Training Program for Interactionist Cognitive Neuroscience (ICoN) Our training program for Interactionist Cognitive Neuroscience (ICoN) seeks to provide student-focused, interdisciplinary training in computational cognitive neuroscience that integrates data from multiple scales and levels of analysis. Transformative gains in understanding the human brain and mental health require integration across multiple levels of analysis. Recent historic advances in genetics and cellular biology are paving the way for understanding fundamentals of neural function. At the other end of the spectrum, methods for imaging and stimulating human brains non-invasively have led to revolutionary advances in discovering the macro-scale organization supporting perception, motivation, and cognition. Now, a major effort at the `systems' level between these two scales is beginning to uncover the activity, connectivity, and computations of neural circuits. The advent of this systems-level progress holds the promise of linking core circuit computations to emergent human behavior and leading to detailed, transdiagnostic models of mental illness. However, as we recently argued (Badre, Frank and Moore, 2015 Neuron), fulfilling this promise requires making direct links between circuit-level computation and the emergent function of the human system. We believe that integrating systems- and human neuroscience in this way demands a systematic approach built on two key strategies. First, formal computational models must be used to provide principled links between levels of analysis; and, second, complementary methods must be applied, and in the ideal case parallel human and non-human studies conducted in coordination. Achieving these aims requires a new generation of scientists that can take full advantage of multiple techniques and data sources, and who are deeply versed in computational theory. Traditional neuroscience training relies on an apprenticeship model that limits students to a single lab and level of inquiry. Thus, a specialized training program is required to specifically equip neuroscientists for this `Interactionist' approach. ICoN will provide this training emphasizing the two tenets: I. Computation is key to translating between levels. Students must be rigorously quantitatively trained in formal theory. A close corollary is that they must be fluent in the advanced analysis methods necessary for cross-level integration (e.g., machine learning). II. Next-generation scholars must have expertise at multiple levels. Students must be trained to use and integrate multiple methods and data sources. Further, they must have the skills (and courage) to pursue ideas to their next most logical step, to be question driven and not technique limited. Students will be trained to conduct integrative research projects across domains such as human cognitive neuroscience, systems neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Project Narrative This is an interdisciplinary predoctoral program in computational cognitive neuroscience. Funds from this program will support the training of advanced predoctoral candidates who are capable of applying a combination of empirical and theoretical approaches that decisively addresses their scientific questions about the mind and brain. Training a generation of such scientists holds great promise for making transformative gains in our understanding of mental health and brain diseases and disorders.",Training Program for Interactionist Cognitive Neuroscience (ICoN),9703521,T32MH115895,"['Training Programs', 'cognitive neuroscience']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,T32,2019,144442,0.06459627249215662
"Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NUCATS) ABSTRACT: The health of children and adolescents is a critical determinant of our nation's health over the entire life course. Yet, research into child health lags behind that for adults. In part, this reflects historical, cultural and economic forces that tend to divert investigators into careers other than pediatric research. To address this concern, the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS) chose the unique approach of specifically training young investigators to apply engineering solutions to problems in child health. Our overall goal is to generate a community of pediatricians, data scientists and engineers who collaborate across disciplines, using modern technology to improve the health of children and adolescents. The central focus of this continuing and highly successful effort is this Multidisciplinary Training Program in Child and Adolescent Health TL1, which has three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will train 10 postdoctoral fellows in basic science or pediatrics for two years, in a creative and multidisciplinary environment where investigators are equipped to apply innovative engineering approaches to problems in child and adolescent health. The fellows must have a mentor in both pediatrics and engineering. Presently, their projects range from computer-controlled delivery of general anesthesia or using nanotechnology to treat brain tumors, to applying machine learning to optimize discharge planning. This innovative research experience is complemented by mentoring from the TL1 leadership and from their postdoctoral-fellow peers; required foundational elements, which promote communication across traditionally disparate scientific disciplines; required selective components, assigned to individual fellows to optimize their training in pediatric clinical and translational science; and a menu of enrichment opportunities that are optional for each trainee. All of these components include both didactic and experiential approaches. In Aim 2, to expand the pipeline of engineers entering child and adolescent health research, we will provide 2, one-year positions (1 supported by the CTSA and 1 by institutional funds) for predoctoral engineers entering the last year of PhD training, especially those representing underrepresented minorities, as they complete their research and write their thesis. By including engineering trainees who are interested in CTS in the training activities available to our TL1 postdoctoral fellows, we intend to enhance their potential commitment to pediatric translational science. Finally, in Aim 3, we will provide a summer research experience at Northwestern for 4 students in clinical post-baccalaureate programs at a traditionally underrepresented-minority institution. Our experience to date suggests that, with our ongoing involvement after the summer experience, many of these students have been inspired to seek careers in translational research. Together, these aims outline a comprehensive and successful program to increase the number and quality of investigators applying innovative approaches to improving child and adolescent health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal describes a plan to continue a novel program through which we will develop a community of researchers to apply engineering solutions to problems in child health. We will train clinical and basic science postdoctoral fellows with a common curriculum, so that they learn to work together to translate new technical advances into approaches to patient care. To expand the pipeline of trainees entering this field, we will also implement programs to attract predoctoral students and underrepresented-minority, masters-program students to child-health research.",Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NUCATS),9938876,TL1TR001423,[' '],NCATS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,TL1,2019,678633,0.03471670885125929
"Training in Child Health Services Research and Implementation Science This renewal application builds on the expertise of an experienced and dedicated faculty with a 23-year history of leading successful AHRQ-funded, post-doctoral NRSA training programs focused specifically on pediatric health services research. In an increasingly dynamic US health care system, meeting the needs of children will require health services researchers to be trained in novel and wide-ranging methods to study and improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of health care. Through expanding faculty and partnerships, our program stands ready to meet the needs of our trainees to tackle health services research that builds on advances in science, technology, and data analytics, including genomics; data mining and machine learning; novel diagnostics and therapeutics; and information technology. In this renewal, we will continue the core programmatic collaborations among Boston Children's Hospital, the MassGeneral Hospital for Children, and the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School as well as the successful engagement of our newest partner—the Institute for Healthcare Improvement—which has brought its recognized expertise in care improvement and implementation science to our trainees through curricular enhancements and research opportunities. As both the development of research and its implementation are increasingly informed by patients and the patient experience, our program will continue to engage patients and parents to provide substantive feedback on trainees' current and future research, as an integral aspect of our program's culture. For this renewal, we will also engage with new partners to address the expanding role of information technology in healthcare. Our program will focus on four pillars of training: 1) cutting edge observational methods to learn from health and health system data; 2) application of implementation science and related methods to improve the design, delivery, and evaluation of care for children across a variety of financing and delivery systems; 3) incorporating the perspective of patients and families into the process for designing and conducting research; and 4) framing research in children as a part of health over the life course, especially the pervasive, enduring impact of disparities in care and services. The program will support 6 stipends per year (3 first-year and 3 second-year continuing postdoctoral fellows) to create a critical mass of trainees across subspecialties, areas of research, and methodological domains. In addition to conducting closely mentored research, each trainee will complete the requirements of an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for core skills of biostatistics and epidemiology, and participate in advanced health services research methods training. Our well-developed program infrastructure and system for close monitoring of trainees' progress will ensure the continuation of our record of graduating individuals who will lead relevant, applied health services research that translates into both improved care and health outcomes for all children. The proposed renewal will continue our successful program to train child health researchers to conduct meaningful research leading to improvements in health care delivery for children. The program will include training in the established building blocks of health services research (epidemiology, statistics, and study design) as well as methods of improvement and implementation science. Trainees will be equipped to engage with the evolving US healthcare system, focusing on research that reduces health and health care disparities, is informed by the patient perspective, and is ready for integration into clinical delivery systems. Our graduates will help to transform the current health care system to be more efficient, effective, and patient and family-centered for all children.",Training in Child Health Services Research and Implementation Science,9735257,T32HS000063,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,T32,2019,489884,0.042382517967395776
"Integrated Biostatistical Training for CVD Research Project Title: Integrated Biostatistical Training for CVD Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This application proposes renewal of a novel, integrated program for predoctoral training in biostatistics focused on preparing trainees for careers in cardiovascular disease research. The escalating demand for skilled biostatisticians equipped to address ongoing and emerging challenges in this exciting era of cardiovascular disease research calls for training that formally integrates deep and sustained experience in collaboration in a multidisciplinary environment, mastery of the theoretical underpinnings of statistics required for valid application of sophisticated biostatistical techniques and for research on development of new methodology, and strong emphasis on communication and leadership skills. The program will be a joint effort of the Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University (NCSU), the Duke University Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (B&B), and the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI). It capitalizes on the long-standing partnership between the two departments and a medical research institution that is the largest Academic Research Organization in the world, with internationally known researchers at the forefront of cardiovascular disease and related research. The five-year program will support five (5) trainee positions in the NCSU Department and one (1) position in Years 1 and 2 and two (2) in Years 3-5 in Duke B&B. In addition, NCSU, Duke, and DCRI will provide two, one, and two matching positions in each year, respectively. Trainees at each institution will pursue rigorous study of statistical theory, including probability, inference, linear and other statistical models, advanced probability, and advanced statistical inference; and of statistical methods, including clinical trials design/analysis, longitudinal data analysis, survival analysis, and cutting-edge topics, such as record linkage, machine learning, parallel computing relevant to biomedical Big Data. They will also receive training in fundamental aspects of biology and cardiovascular medicine as well as research responsibility and ethics; and extensive formal and experiential training in communication and leadership skills. Trainees will be introduced to DCRI cardiovascular disease research gradually and evolve to full collaborative apprenticeships in which they are integrated as functioning members of DCRI project teams. Through this apprenticeship and formal courses and seminars, trainees will develop considerable working knowledge of cardiovascular medicine that will position them to make immediate contributions to cardiovascular disease research upon completion of the program. Each trainee will be assigned an inter-institutional mentorship team comprising a biostatistician mentor at each of NCSU and B&B and a clinician mentor whose primary affiliation is at DCRI, which will collaborate in guiding them through all aspects. Dissertation research will involve development and evaluation of novel statistical methodology inspired by challenges encountered in trainees' collaborations. Trainees will benefit from exposure to different cultures across both institutions, broadening their perspectives and access to courses, seminars, and other resources. ! Project Title: Integrated Biostatistical Training for CVD Research PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are key contributors to cardiovascular disease research, and demand continues to escalate for PhD biostatisticians with the required training, particularly in this era of biomedical big data.

"Training in Oncology Population Sciences (TOPS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Training in Oncology Population Sciences (TOPS) T32 program will train postdoctoral fellows to conduct research at the T3 and T4 interface to translate knowledge from the lab into practice and population health to reduce the burden of cancer. The need for translational research at the T3 and T4 interface stems from persistent disparities in cancer outcomes and implementation gaps between what is possible in the context of clinical trials and what happens in routine practice. The TOPS program will train 3 postdoctoral fellows each year in collaboration with 36 faculty from across the 7 institutions of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Training will provide fellows with the skills necessary to address the challenges and opportunities brought about by the tremendous growth in the complexity of cancer care, precision medicine, electronic health records, mobile health, machine learning and data sharing. The TOPS program has 3 specific strategies to achieve this overarching objective: 1) training in core methods and skills necessary for investigation through coursework and participation in regular seminars, workshops and reading; 2) intensive focus on a research project with close supervision from one or more mentors; and, 3) training in professional skills that are prerequisite for investigation including project development, grant writing, presentation, building and working with diverse teams, running a dry-laboratory and the responsible conduct of research. The TOPS T32 proposal is a renewal of the successful R25CA092203 Program in Cancer Outcomes Research Training (PCORT), which trained 41 pre- and post-doctoral fellows between 2002 and 2017. TOPS will be co- led by Dr. Nancy Keating, a primary care physician, and Dr. Deborah Schrag, a medical oncologist, both accomplished cancer-focused population scientists who served on the PCORT Steering Committee and trained numerous fellows who have become independent researchers. TOPS intends to train postdoctoral students with degrees in the fields of medicine, nursing, behavioral science, pharmacy, economics, clinical epidemiology, health policy, informatics, and engineering for careers dedicated to cancer-focused population science. The core of the program is a group of 36 faculty mentors and 13 emerging mentors with expertise in quality measurement, design of patient, clinician, community and health system-level interventions, conduct of pragmatic trials, comparative effectiveness research, analysis of survey, administrative and electronic health record data, and expertise in organizational and behavioral strategies that optimize implementation. At the end of the two-year training, TOPS program participants will be well-equipped with the skills necessary to launch independent research careers in cancer-focused population science and have access to the core resources of the DF/HCC and the Harvard Catalyst program for translational research training. The TOPS co-directors and are supported by an 8-member Steering Committee that includes leaders from each of the 7 institutional members of the DF/HCC and 6 accomplished investigators in population science who will serve as Advisors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Research investigation in population science is essential to ensure that discoveries from molecular medicine and clinical trials translate to routine practice and ultimately decrease the population-level burden of cancer. The Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) T32 Training in Oncology Population Sciences (TOPS) program will equip postdoctoral fellows with the skills necessary to evaluate cancer care quality and effectiveness, and to develop, test and implement interventions to improve care delivery thereby ensuring that T1/T2 discoveries translate across the T3/T4 bridge to achieve maximal impact on population health.

"iDISCOVER: Integrated Data Science Training in CardioVascular Medicine Abstract: This new T32 proposal will support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows pursuing integrated data science training in cardiovascular (CV) medicine at UCLA. Integrated data science training programs are very limited in today’s CV biomedical community. Data science challenges facing CV medicine are in many ways unique and have a long historic track record of information and data. CV diseases are chronic, heterogeneous disorders that exhibit distinct temporal profiles combined with multi-organ alterations, necessitating novel analysis platforms that integrate findings across expanded continuums of diverse information (e.g., text, imaging, omics). The complexity and size of CV datasets have pushed computational approaches to their limits, thus attenuating the rate for adding value in CV medicine. To this end, there is broad consensus that we must merge data science with CV medicine. The creation of a next-generation workforce having more advanced understanding of data science tactics for addressing real-world CV problems will ultimately realize precision CV medicine. Our T32 fills a unique niche in CV data science that is currently missing, both at UCLA and nationally. The UCLA Integrated Data Science Training in CV Medicine (iDISCOVER) Program draws upon faculty from the UCLA Schools of Medicine and Engineering, to establish a program for trainees committed to intensive data science applications in CV medicine. We have a substantiated track record in establishing training programs, as evidenced by our NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative, Heart BD2K Center at UCLA. Experience has enabled us to construct a T32 research program targeting the most pressing data science questions in CV medicine. Our two-year program will accept qualified students who have completed 1st year PhD training from Computer Science (CS), Bioinformatics (BI) or Bioengineering (BE); and eligible postdoc fellows from elite CV programs. We will train predoctoral students during their second and third year of PhD training, and postdoctoral fellows during their first and second year of their fellowship. Trainees will engage in advanced coursework within the specific focus areas: (i) omics phenotyping-supported outcome studies; (ii) machine learning-supported approaches in CV medicine; and (iii) information indexing and knowledgebase construction. Trainees will engage in CV clinical rotations to give them exposure to pressing CV data science questions. Trainees will be guided by a co-mentoring arrangement (1 CV mentor and 1 data science mentor). We have an outstanding group of 14 core faculty and 6 clinical supporting faculty members in the UCLA Schools of Medicine, Engineering and Life Sciences. Our faculty have established, vibrant and well-funded research programs with strong histories of guiding students to successful careers. Our program promotes the training of underrepresented minority groups, as demonstrated by training records of all faculty. Our iDISCOVER program has the institutional backing from Schools of Medicine, Engineering, Grad Division, Depts. of CS, BI, and BE, as well as Cardiology and Physiology. These elements ensure solid support for program implementation, advancement and success. PROGRAM NARRATIVE The UCLA iDISCOVER Program aims to train and inspire a new generation of cardiovascular informaticians who will lead the development of innovative approaches that inform and enable precision cardiovascular medicine. iDISCOVER establishes a cross-campus, interdisciplinary environment to teach and mentor future scientists in cutting-edge computational and data science methods; and encourages novel, team science research opportu- nities for engineering graduate students to work with and learn from leading experts in cardiovascular medicine. iDISCOVER trainees are exposed to the breadth of contemporary biomedical informatics research, and are ulti- mately prepared to be productive, independent scientists that will participate in shaping the discipline of modern data science-driven cardiovascular research and healthcare.",iDISCOVER: Integrated Data Science Training in CardioVascular Medicine,9670144,T32HL139450,"['Cardiovascular system', 'Data Science', 'Medicine', 'Training']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,T32,2019,257107,0.08010704907727857
"Physics and Biology in Medicine Research Training Abstract: The specific aim of this training grant's competitive renewal proposal is to continue the development of research scientists that are well versed in physics, biology, mathematics, chemistry, engineering and computer science, who also understand the application of these disciplines to the detection, diagnosis and assessment of treatment of disease. While the focus of this training program is the UCLA Physics and Biology in Medicine (formerly Biomedical Physics) Interdepartmental Graduate Program, the training program is not limited to the traditional practice of Medical Physics and is much broader in scope. This training program has four tracks. The Medical Imaging track investigates the physics of diagnostic radiology modalities (e.g. MRI, MR Spectroscopy, CT) and Computer Vision methods to investigate areas such as quantitative imaging, imaging biomarkers and Radiomics (as well as correlation with genomic factors – Imaging Genomics) all of which seek to extract additional information from image data and relate it to other key information about patients and disease. The Molecular Imaging track investigates a wide range of topics including the physics of PET, optical and combined imaging modalities, immuno-PET, the chemistry and biology of novel imaging tracers, microfluidics, nanotechnology and others all focused on providing investigations of basic biological mechanisms, both normal and pathological. This includes investigations with applications in oncology (including responses to immunotherapies), traumatic brain injury, neurodegeneration and other conditions. The Molecular and Cellular Oncology track investigates the molecular, cellular, and tissue-related effects of radiation. This also includes a wide range of topics from Radiation Genomics (Radiogenomics) which explores genetic components of both radiation sensitivity and radiation resistance, the role of the immune system in response to radiation, cancer stem cells and radiation response as well as signal transduction pathways and their influence on radiation response. The Therapeutic Medical Physics track investigates novel approaches to treatment delivery systems including methods to improve the accuracy of treatment delivery such as breathing motion models for real time MRI guided treatment delivery to 4π treatment methods and brachytherapy. This program has been training primarily Ph.D. students for more than 60 years (40 years with this training grant), and is unique in that it brings together researchers from basic sciences with investigators in the clinical translational sciences and physicians who are truly clinical researchers, all in a common environment dedicated to bringing basic research to clinical applications. This program has the faculty, students, infrastructure and backing of its supporting Departments (Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Radiological Sciences and Radiation Oncology) as well as the newly formed Graduate Programs in Biosciences to continue to achieve its goals of training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE This training grant aims to continue to develop research scientists that are well versed in physics, biology, mathematics, chemistry, engineering and computer science, who also understand the application of these disciplines to the instruments and techniques used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of disease as well as research fields that help us understand basic mechanisms of disease. These scientists will become actively involved in research into new methods that seek earlier diagnosis of disease as well as more specific (patient specific, disease specific) treatments of disease in many clinical applications.",Physics and Biology in Medicine Research Training,9753752,T32EB002101,"['Biology', 'Medicine', 'Physics', 'Research Training']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,T32,2019,258702,0.09251621091400014
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9778578,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2019,225000,0.053167816092244906
"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification. This is particularly important for science, given the fact that students from high- poverty schools are economically disadvantaged and may comprise a large proportion of individuals from minority groups that are underrepresented in science.",Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram,9605786,R25ES028974,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Case Study', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High School Faculty', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'K-12 Faculty', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Program Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'STEM career', 'School Teachers', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'apprenticeship', 'base', 'college', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'exposure route', 'health literacy', 'health science research', 'high school program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experience', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pedagogical content', 'programs', 'response', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'stressor', 'summer research', 'teacher', 'tool']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2019,99506,0.04979110174244041
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side.

"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology and cognition PROGRAM SUMMARY The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU's unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook's AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side.

"Biomedical Informatics Training at Stanford Biomedical Informatics Training at Stanford 7. Project Summary/Abstract: The opportunities for creating new methods to advance biomedical discovery are unprecedented. Since 1982, the Stanford Biomedical Informatics (BMI) training program has granted PhD and MS degrees to students with intensive training that prepares them for careers in research. It now benefits from the creation of a new Department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford, for which it will be the primary graduate training program. The formal BMI curriculum consists of (1) Core BMI, (2) Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics and Engineering, (3) Ethical, Social, Legal Implications of technology, and (4) Domain biology or medicine. The curriculum is appropriate for research training in Translational Bioinformatics (TB, including environmental exposure informatics), Health care/clinical informatics (HC), and Clinical Research Informatics (CR). Stanford's research milieu provides outstanding opportunities for informatics research. We are in the 32nd year as an NLM-supported training program, with approximately 80 current students (33 PhD, 12 research MS, 28 Co-terminal MS, and 12 Professional (distance) MS). We have produced 150 PhD graduates and 75 MS research graduates, more than 50% of whom have been NLM-supported. In this proposal, we request annual support for training 11 pre-doctoral candidates (including two environmental exposure informatics slots), 6 postdoctoral candidates, and 4 short-term diversity. We receive more than 200 applicants per year for our PhD and MS program. We are evolving our curriculum to respond to new opportunities in big data, statistics and machine learning, and are focusing increasingly on individual advising and career mentorship as the diversity of opportunities for our graduates explodes. The BMI program will continue to produce leaders in academic and industrial biomedical informatics, and will prepare them to conduct biomedical informatics research that advances human health.

The program is further strengthened by close partnerships with area health care organizations and companies specializing in biopharmaceuticals, heath care, IT and analytics. Recognizing the many challenges associated with health data analytics and use, the three foundational aspects of the CHIP training programs are: 1) Methods for health data analytics, 2) Building powerful interactive analytics systems that allow customization and support decision making for a wide variety of health care operations, and 3) Addressing translational challenges in implementing and managing information systems that leverage health data analytics effectively. Given that CHIP is a highly interdisciplinary program, it will draw upon its diverse faculty, research centers, laboratories, and other rich resources to develop three major types of activities as part of the proposed advanced predoctoral and postdoctoral training program. The three activities are: 1) Research methods and analytics techniques for clinical data science, imaging informatics, precision medicine, and big data analytics for population health, 2) Didactic learning based on courses in machine learning, biostatistics, big data management, and visual analytics and additional courses that are rooted in realistic health care problems, and 3) Large- scale, population-oriented system development, deployment, and outcome evaluation. Improving human health by leveraging health data analytics demands that the critical problems and development of solutions are approached from a broad perspective, carefully taking into account evidence ranging from molecular-scale to population-scale and drawing upon knowledge from biostatistics, information science, and computing.

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity. Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States. The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments. At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs. TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics, computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding; they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate summer fellows. Project Narrative Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use, understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems.

"University of Utah Biomedical Informatics Training Grant Project Summary/Abstract This proposal explains how Utah will continue to enhance the Department of Biomedical Informatics' exemplary record of graduate informatics training. Our Department celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2015 and is justly proud of its impact on the science of informatics and on the informatics community. In this fourth renewal application, we present our plans for rejuvenation and growth carefully tailored to meet the challenges of our rapidly evolving field. Our long-term charter has unwaveringly sought to create and sustain a state-of-the-art, adaptive, and rigorous training environment that promotes research excellence and innovation. The mission of our program builds on four general areas of focus: 1) Clinical Informatics; 2) Clinical Research Informatics; 3) Population and Public Health Informatics; and 4) Bioinformatics and Statistical Genetics. Woven through these areas of focus are three strong methodology lines: 1) sociotechnical design and evaluation, 2) biomedical natural language processing, and 3) data analytic and decision support. This level of integration greatly enhances the power and rigor of the curriculum. The result will be trainees fully equipped with the requisite command of theory, mastery of skills, and deep knowledge base required to impact health outcomes in major ways throughout their research. The aims of our training program are:  1) To provide a rigorous and integrated curriculum giving students the necessary  foundation for an innovative and effective research career in biomedical informatics.  2) To continue to recruit the highest quality and most diverse trainees, including under-  represented minorities and women.  3) To ensure students have strong foundations in the conduct of ethical, rigorous, and  responsible research.  4) To provide a comprehensive research environment with the broadest possible variety of  resources for faculty and students to encourage creative and innovative research. Our trainee research environment is unparalleled. We provide access to clinical, public health, data science, and translational clinical research opportunities. Utah has a superb computational infrastructure as well as one of the largest network healthcare settings in the nation, including a major academic medical center; a statewide nonprofit healthcare network; and a regional Veterans Administration Medical Center. All three are national leaders in informatics.

"Stanford Health Services Research Training Program Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of Stanford's proposed Health Services Research Training Program (HSRTP) is to develop independent, well-trained, diverse researchers who conduct rigorous and innovative health services research (HSR) on important challenges facing the U.S. health care system. Our program design is motivated by our view that excellent health services researchers need a strong grasp of core disciplinary skills, the ability to function in multidisciplinary settings, and the ability to engage with both traditional and emerging research contexts. Accordingly, our program emphasizes strong disciplinary training in our core areas of health economics, outcomes research, and decision science. We provide this training within the rich multidisciplinary environment of our integrated campus. Our trainees will frequently be side-by-side with trainees and faculty from areas like clinical medicine, economics, engineering, ethics, informatics, and law.  Mentored research experiences are designed to further our program design goals. Trainees will pursue one or more independent research projects in their area(s) of interest, working with multiple mentors with complementary areas of expertise. The program will connect trainees with mentors focused on trainees' topics and methods of interest as well as at least one mentor focused on career development. The program includes 30 faculty mentors, drawn from 12 departments or programs. Trainees will find opportunities to engage in research projects in a wide variety of HSR areas, including AHRQ priority areas like health insurance, quality and safety, affordability, and access. As they pursue their research, our program will particularly facilitate engagement with emerging HSR topics, settings, and methods. Our program includes faculty and other connections to Stanford's strong and expanding capabilities in the areas of population health management, learning health care systems, informatics, and health law. We take advantage of extensive recent investments in cutting-edge data and computing resources to support HSR; the creation of HSR-related collaborations with institutions like Intermountain Health, Kaiser Permanente, Google, and Facebook; and the presence of leading investigators in advanced computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, textual processing, and their application to new data sources and types.  The program will support 5 pre- and 4 postdoctoral trainees per year, providing 2-3 years of full time support for each trainee. Predoctoral trainees will earn a PhD in Health Policy or a related field and postdoctoral fellows with a professional degree (e.g. MD) will commonly earn an MS in Health Policy. Postdoctoral trainees with a research degree will focus on research activities complemented by targeted electives. Our aim is that these trainees will strengthen the next generation of diverse HSR leaders, equipped to generate, translate and disseminate the evidence needed to improve health care delivery in the United States. Project Narrative The proposed training program will contribute to public health by developing researchers who conduct rigorous, innovative research on important challenges facing the U.S. health care system.

"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program. We aim to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by preparing PREP Scholars for the rigors and challenges of a biomedical doctoral degree program so that they will successfully obtain a PhD degree or MD/PhD degree and contribute their expertise to the biomedical scientific community.",LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences,9566214,R25GM121189,"['Academic Training', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data Analyses', 'Degree program', 'Dentistry', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Extramural Activities', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Historically Black Colleges and Universities', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Louisiana', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Enrollment', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Oral', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Study Skills', 'Sum', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'gulf coast', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'member', 'minority communities', 'novel', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'recruit', 'role model', 'science education', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student', 'university student']",NIGMS,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R25,2018,235732,0.11445169665147038
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9479717,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2018,423431,0.10228475983831398
"Training in Complex Systems and Data Science Approaches Applied to the Neurobiology of Drug Use The purpose of this program is to train pre- and post-doctoral scholars in the application of complex systems and data science approaches to the neurobiology of substance abuse, with the dual strategies of: (1) training candidates with expertise in data science, applied mathematics, computer science, and complex systems to apply their skills to the neuroscience of addiction; and (2) training candidates pursuing addiction research from neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology and genetics in the theory and application of Big Data methods, including network analysis, machine learning algorithms, and Bayesian statistical models. Trainees will be paired across disciplines, and academic stages, for research collaboration and reciprocal tutoring to facilitate the development of proficiency in each trainee's new field. Each trainee will also be dual mentored, their secondary mentor being their partner's primary. Over its five-year duration, the program will provide three years of funding for each of five pairs of pre- and post-doctoral researchers, with an initial cohort of four (two pairs), and additional pairs entering in each of the middle three years. The core curriculum will incorporate: (1) the established complex systems and data science graduate certificate at the University of Vermont; (2) course work in neuroscience, psychology and addiction, including classes focused on developing human subjects research skills; as well as (3) specialized courses designed to directly and effectively bridge the gap between the core disciplines. Trainees will also attend a biweekly journal club and monthly seminar, led by senior participants in the program, to further support the acquisition of multidisciplinary research skills.  The overarching aim of the program is to produce researchers poised to apply state-of-the-art analytic tools to understand the neurobiology of drug abuse. The focus will be characterizing the neural substrates of addiction and other comorbid psychopathologies, always with an eye toward clinical application. Recent increases in the quantity and quality of large-sample, multi-modal datasets that address the neural, genetic and environmental substrates of addiction make this a propitious time for such a training program. Researchers at UVM are ideally suited to provide this training as there exist close links between addiction research, cognitive neuroscience, complex systems and data science, and the mentoring faculty have access to exceptional datasets that are ideal for interrogation with Big Data methods. Armed with coherent domain knowledge and practiced with advanced methods for complex systems, trainees will develop analysis pipelines that: (1) incorporate sophisticated aggregation of longitudinal and multi-modal datasets, including various neuroimaging modalities, genetic information, survey and clinical data; (2) harness the power of supercomputing and modern machine learning algorithms to step beyond linear and univariate effects; and (3) address questions of immediate clinical importance to substance abuse that can inform the determination of risk factors, treatment and intervention strategy, and policy decisions. The overarching aim of this training program is to produce substance abuse researchers well versed in the theory and application of state-of-the-art analytic tools for complex systems in the context of cognitive neuroscience broadly defined. The research focus is on characterizing the neural substrates of addiction, with natural extensions to the study of other psychopathologies, and all work undertaken will maintain an eye toward clinical application. Research results, methods and analysis pipelines developed by trainees and their mentors will be made publically available, and may inform the determination of risk factors, treatment and intervention strategy, and policy decisions made by public health professionals.!",Training in Complex Systems and Data Science Approaches Applied to the Neurobiology of Drug Use,9490987,T32DA043593,"['Complex', 'Data Science', 'Drug usage', 'Neurobiology', 'System', 'Training']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,T32,2018,243546,0.044996667657393206
"Biomedical Data Science Graduate Training at Stanford ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The expanded ability to collect data at all scales-molecular, cellular, tissue, organism and population-has created unparalleled opportunities for biomedical discovery. These opportunities cross all areas of research from basic science to clinical care. In response to these tremendously exciting emerging challenges in data science, Stanford University announced the creation of a new Department of Biomedical Data Science (DBDS) to begin in fall of 2015. Fundamental to the DBDS is bringing together faculty in (1) informatics and computer science, and (2) biostatistics and mathematical modeling, who work closely with a broad range of (3) biomedical science collaborators to advance knowledge. The Stanford Biomedical Informatics (BMI) training program is focused on the creation of new methods for the organization, analysis and modeling of biomedical data and knowledge. The BMI program has been a small interdisciplinary program at Stanford for more than 33 years; nonetheless, it has produced many leaders in biomedical informatics and data science. The BMI program will now have its administrative home in the DBDS, and will become the epicenter for biomedical data science training at Stanford. We are able quickly to respond to the shortage of trained scientists in biomedical data science because of a flexible curriculum, an unusually fertile set of course offerings, and a plethora of research opportunities. In this proposal, we outline a plan to engage faculty broadly across the University to create scalable mechanisms for training the next generation of biomedical data scientists, and creating a pathway for ""data science"" within the BMI program that stresses statistical reasoning, machine learning and data mining of biomedical data.

"Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics Project Summary We propose to continue the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) pre-doctoral training program at Harvard Medical School. Since its inception in 2000, this program has provided rigorous multidisciplinary education in genome sciences for those students with proven excellence in quantitative fields. The gap between the ability to generate large amounts genomic data and the ability to efficiently analyze and interpret them continues to grow. Our program aims to train multi-disciplinary investigators who are capable of both integrating the genome-scale technologies into their experimental investigations and synthesizing the resulting datasets into coherent knowledge frameworks and mathematical models. The BIG training program draws on three significant strengths of the local academic environment: the breadth of talented investigators at Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals and research institutes; the rich variety of quantitatively-oriented courses in bioinformatics and genomics offered at Harvard and MIT; and national leadership of BIG faculty in genome-scale disease research, including harnessing of genomic approaches to clinical applications. The BIG pre-doctoral curriculum includes the following: 1) courses in fundamentals of genetics and molecular biology, taken alongside graduate students in the biological sciences; 2) statistics and machine learning, with focus on their applications to population studies, clinical medicine and basic biology; 3) survey of the larger scope of biomedical sciences, including medical informatics and translational medicine. This training program will continue to produce leaders, both in academia and industry, who are using genomic sciences to advance biomedical research and its application to medicine. Project Narrative Integrating genomics into the practice of biomedical research and medicine is a primary goal of the National Human Genome Research Institute's strategic plan. The Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Program at Harvard Medical School meets this goal by providing students trained in the quantitative sciences the intellectual tools to integrate genomics with biomedical sciences, access to “big data” from genome sciences and healthcare systems, and faculty mentors who are experts in genomics and bioinformatics. This program will continue to produce leaders who are using genomic sciences to advance biomedical research and clinical practice.",Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics,9571731,T32HG002295,"['Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Training']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,T32,2018,695243,0.041827032944278954
"University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data for Genomics and Neuroscience ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Washington conducts world-class research in the development of big data analytics, as well as in many areas of biomedical research. However, most predoctoral students in biomedical science do not receive cutting-edge training in statistical and computational methods for big data. Furthermore, most predoctoral students in statistics and computing do not receive in-depth training in biomedical science. In short, the university currently lacks an integrated training program that spans computation, statistics, and biomedical science. Given the growing importance of big data across many areas of biomedical research, such an integrated program is critically needed.  In order to train a new generation of researchers with expertise in statistics, computing, and biomedical science, we propose the University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data from Genomics and Neuroscience (BDGN). This program will focus on two areas of biomedical science, both of which are characterized by huge amounts of data as well as extensive expertise at the University of Washington: genomics and neuroscience. The program will draw six predoctoral students per year from the following seven PhD programs: Applied Mathematics, Biology, Biostatistics, Computer Science & Engineering, Genome Sciences, Neuroscience, and Statistics. Trainees will be appointed to the training grant during their ﬁrst or second year of hD studies and will continue on the training grant for two years. They will take a rigorous curriculum that involves three courses in statistics, machine learning, and data science, and three courses in either genomics or neuroscience. Each trainee will be paired with two world-class faculty mentors: one specializing in either genomics or neuroscience, and a second specializing in the development of either computational or statistical methods for big data. Other key features of the training program include three one-quarter rotations, with at least one focusing on genomics or neuroscience and one focusing on statistical or computational methods, a summer internship program, opportunities to attend world-class summer courses run through UW programs, peer mentoring, seminars, journal clubs, and courses on reproducible research and on responsible conduct of research. All predoctoral trainees will leave the BDGN Training Program with a core set of skills and a common language required for generating, interpreting, and developing statistical and computational methods for big data from genomics or neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies in biomedical research have led to the generation of very large data sets, such as DNA sequences and fMRI images. However, in order to use these big data sets to improve scientiﬁc understanding and human health, there is a need for a new generation of biomedical scientists with interdisciplinary training that spans three areas: computer science, statistics, and biomedicine.

"Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of our new, multidisciplinary institutional training program, based in the Schools of Medicine and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, is to train pre-doctoral engineering students and physician postdoctoral fellows in Neuroengineering and its clinical translation. Disorders of the nervous system, such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, depression, dementia, and head trauma, constitute 35% of all disease and disability, and the burden is rising. There is an explosion of promising therapies for these disorders in new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate neural circuits, but translating these therapies from the laboratory to patients is a challenge. It requires talented engineers educated in clinical science and technically proficient physicians who speak the same language. Together these investigators must navigate a complex scientific, regulatory, and clinical landscape. Despite the huge demand, few formal, interdisciplinary Neuroengineering training programs exist.  We propose a new program shared by the Penn Schools of Medicine and Engineering focused on Neuroengineering and Clinical Translation. Physician and Engineering trainees will together become fluent in cutting-edge technologies at the forefront of Neuroengineering, such as devices, neurostimulation, machine learning, and algorithm development; cloud computing, nanotechnology and materials science. They will innovate new therapies for human disease and gain a thorough understanding of the clinical, regulatory, and developmental environments necessary to safely bring new technologies to patients. The program's core is a group of collaborative, multidisciplinary faculty mentors in engineering and the clinical neurosciences. In addition to dedicated neuroengineering research, our training program includes: (1) a longitudinal mentored clinical experience for PhD candidates, (2) engineering lab immersion and tutorial for MD postdoctoral fellows, (3) formal courses and seminars in Engineering, Neuroscience and Medicine, (4) training in the proper conduct of research, and (5) workshops on professional and career development, including scientific writing, public presentations, grant writing, and laboratory management. The program will recruit from an excellent pool of ~50 MD fellows and 80-90 PhD students each year. This effort formalizes a collaboration that has trained an impressive array of Neuroengineering investigators over the past twelve years. The program, unique at Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment, including a compact campus where robust centers for Engineering, Medicine and Neuroscience all reside within two blocks of each other, united through Penn's new Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine Disorders of the nervous system represent one of the largest, fastest growing areas of medical need in the United States. The most promising therapies for these disorders are new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate activity in neural circuits.

"Training in Child Health Services Research and Implementation Science This renewal application builds on the expertise of an experienced and dedicated faculty with a 23-year history of leading successful AHRQ-funded, post-doctoral NRSA training programs focused specifically on pediatric health services research. In an increasingly dynamic US health care system, meeting the needs of children will require health services researchers to be trained in novel and wide-ranging methods to study and improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of health care. Through expanding faculty and partnerships, our program stands ready to meet the needs of our trainees to tackle health services research that builds on advances in science, technology, and data analytics, including genomics; data mining and machine learning; novel diagnostics and therapeutics; and information technology. In this renewal, we will continue the core programmatic collaborations among Boston Children's Hospital, the MassGeneral Hospital for Children, and the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School as well as the successful engagement of our newest partner—the Institute for Healthcare Improvement—which has brought its recognized expertise in care improvement and implementation science to our trainees through curricular enhancements and research opportunities. As both the development of research and its implementation are increasingly informed by patients and the patient experience, our program will continue to engage patients and parents to provide substantive feedback on trainees' current and future research, as an integral aspect of our program's culture. For this renewal, we will also engage with new partners to address the expanding role of information technology in healthcare. Our program will focus on four pillars of training: 1) cutting edge observational methods to learn from health and health system data; 2) application of implementation science and related methods to improve the design, delivery, and evaluation of care for children across a variety of financing and delivery systems; 3) incorporating the perspective of patients and families into the process for designing and conducting research; and 4) framing research in children as a part of health over the life course, especially the pervasive, enduring impact of disparities in care and services. The program will support 6 stipends per year (3 first-year and 3 second-year continuing postdoctoral fellows) to create a critical mass of trainees across subspecialties, areas of research, and methodological domains. In addition to conducting closely mentored research, each trainee will complete the requirements of an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for core skills of biostatistics and epidemiology, and participate in advanced health services research methods training. Our well-developed program infrastructure and system for close monitoring of trainees' progress will ensure the continuation of our record of graduating individuals who will lead relevant, applied health services research that translates into both improved care and health outcomes for all children. The proposed renewal will continue our successful program to train child health researchers to conduct meaningful research leading to improvements in health care delivery for children. The program will include training in the established building blocks of health services research (epidemiology, statistics, and study design) as well as methods of improvement and implementation science. Trainees will be equipped to engage with the evolving US healthcare system, focusing on research that reduces health and health care disparities, is informed by the patient perspective, and is ready for integration into clinical delivery systems.

"Medical Imaging Informatics Training Grant ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) With the “digital era of biomedicine” upon us, exciting opportunities arise to revolutionize how we perform scien- tific research and deliver healthcare. Burgeoning areas like precision medicine foreshadow a transformation of how we understand disease and its individually-tailored treatment. In this context, the importance of imaging continues to grow, both as a driver of new knowledge and as a vital tool which uses these insights towards better detection, diagnosis, and treatment for patients. But achieving the full promise of this future still requires over- coming many barriers, and new imaging informaticians must be equipped with the cutting-edge skills that will create and support the necessary computational advances and methods. The UCLA Medical Imaging Informatics (MII) training program aims to be a leader in training this next generation of imaging informaticians who will develop the needed computational approaches and applications that enable this future. Bringing together leading experts from across our institution in imaging, engineering (computer and data science, electrical, bioengineering), (bio)statistics, and medicine, MII envisions an environment fostering interdisciplinary teaching and mentoring of students; and promoting innovative research throughout the spectrum of imaging informatics. MII's training program involves a comprehensive 1-year core curriculum introducing foun- dational principles of the discipline, forming a breadth of understanding while reinforcing the technical proficien- cies needed by any imaging informatician. Students complete coursework covering topics presented from the perspective of medical imaging and healthcare, including: information architectures; data and knowledge repre- sentation; data mining; machine learning; biostatistics; and information retrieval. Cross-cutting topics (e.g., radi- ogenomics, multimodal data integration and biomarker development) are presented throughout these courses. In parallel to the core curriculum, students are immediately engaged in research, completing rotations with faculty to gain an appreciation for contemporary imaging informatics projects. With this experience, PhD students sub- sequently specialize via more advanced elective coursework customized to their particular research interests. Students are challenged to propose, develop, and test new imaging informatics methods that will advance the discipline, as well as ultimately change and affect healthcare. Importantly, both training and research are inter- woven within a biomedical application domain and with appropriate PhD and MD mentorship to ensure compu- tational/informatics, clinical, and real-world translational insights and guidance. Recognizing the evolving land- scape of the biomedical workforce, our T32 includes a number of professional development activities, including internships, providing practical (research) experiences in different settings. Through the experiences gained dur- ing this T32 training program, MII students will become independent scientists, prepared to contribute to and lead imaging informatics as it continues to grow. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The UCLA Medical Imaging Informatics (MII) training program aims to train and inspire a new generation of imaging informaticians who will lead the development of innovative approaches that inform and enable precision medicine. MII establishes a cross-campus, interdisciplinary environment to teach and mentor future scientists in cutting-edge computational and data science methods towards imaging; and creates novel, team science re- search opportunities in which graduate students work and learn from leading experts in the field.

"Training in Oncology Population Sciences (TOPS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Training in Oncology Population Sciences (TOPS) T32 program will train postdoctoral fellows to conduct research at the T3 and T4 interface to translate knowledge from the lab into practice and population health to reduce the burden of cancer. The need for translational research at the T3 and T4 interface stems from persistent disparities in cancer outcomes and implementation gaps between what is possible in the context of clinical trials and what happens in routine practice. The TOPS program will train 3 postdoctoral fellows each year in collaboration with 36 faculty from across the 7 institutions of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Training will provide fellows with the skills necessary to address the challenges and opportunities brought about by the tremendous growth in the complexity of cancer care, precision medicine, electronic health records, mobile health, machine learning and data sharing. The TOPS program has 3 specific strategies to achieve this overarching objective: 1) training in core methods and skills necessary for investigation through coursework and participation in regular seminars, workshops and reading; 2) intensive focus on a research project with close supervision from one or more mentors; and, 3) training in professional skills that are prerequisite for investigation including project development, grant writing, presentation, building and working with diverse teams, running a dry-laboratory and the responsible conduct of research. The TOPS T32 proposal is a renewal of the successful R25CA092203 Program in Cancer Outcomes Research Training (PCORT), which trained 41 pre- and post-doctoral fellows between 2002 and 2017. TOPS will be co- led by Dr. Nancy Keating, a primary care physician, and Dr. Deborah Schrag, a medical oncologist, both accomplished cancer-focused population scientists who served on the PCORT Steering Committee and trained numerous fellows who have become independent researchers. TOPS intends to train postdoctoral students with degrees in the fields of medicine, nursing, behavioral science, pharmacy, economics, clinical epidemiology, health policy, informatics, and engineering for careers dedicated to cancer-focused population science. The core of the program is a group of 36 faculty mentors and 13 emerging mentors with expertise in quality measurement, design of patient, clinician, community and health system-level interventions, conduct of pragmatic trials, comparative effectiveness research, analysis of survey, administrative and electronic health record data, and expertise in organizational and behavioral strategies that optimize implementation. At the end of the two-year training, TOPS program participants will be well-equipped with the skills necessary to launch independent research careers in cancer-focused population science and have access to the core resources of the DF/HCC and the Harvard Catalyst program for translational research training. The TOPS co-directors and are supported by an 8-member Steering Committee that includes leaders from each of the 7 institutional members of the DF/HCC and 6 accomplished investigators in population science who will serve as Advisors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Research investigation in population science is essential to ensure that discoveries from molecular medicine and clinical trials translate to routine practice and ultimately decrease the population-level burden of cancer. The Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) T32 Training in Oncology Population Sciences (TOPS) program will equip postdoctoral fellows with the skills necessary to evaluate cancer care quality and effectiveness, and to develop, test and implement interventions to improve care delivery thereby ensuring that T1/T2 discoveries translate across the T3/T4 bridge to achieve maximal impact on population health.

While the focus of this training program is the UCLA Physics and Biology in Medicine (formerly Biomedical Physics) Interdepartmental Graduate Program, the training program is not limited to the traditional practice of Medical Physics and is much broader in scope. This training program has four tracks. The Medical Imaging track investigates the physics of diagnostic radiology modalities (e.g. MRI, MR Spectroscopy, CT) and Computer Vision methods to investigate areas such as quantitative imaging, imaging biomarkers and Radiomics (as well as correlation with genomic factors – Imaging Genomics) all of which seek to extract additional information from image data and relate it to other key information about patients and disease. The Molecular Imaging track investigates a wide range of topics including the physics of PET, optical and combined imaging modalities, immuno-PET, the chemistry and biology of novel imaging tracers, microfluidics, nanotechnology and others all focused on providing investigations of basic biological mechanisms, both normal and pathological. This includes investigations with applications in oncology (including responses to immunotherapies), traumatic brain injury, neurodegeneration and other conditions. The Molecular and Cellular Oncology track investigates the molecular, cellular, and tissue-related effects of radiation. This also includes a wide range of topics from Radiation Genomics (Radiogenomics) which explores genetic components of both radiation sensitivity and radiation resistance, the role of the immune system in response to radiation, cancer stem cells and radiation response as well as signal transduction pathways and their influence on radiation response. The Therapeutic Medical Physics track investigates novel approaches to treatment delivery systems including methods to improve the accuracy of treatment delivery such as breathing motion models for real time MRI guided treatment delivery to 4π treatment methods and brachytherapy. This program has been training primarily Ph.D. students for more than 60 years (40 years with this training grant), and is unique in that it brings together researchers from basic sciences with investigators in the clinical translational sciences and physicians who are truly clinical researchers, all in a common environment dedicated to bringing basic research to clinical applications.

"iDISCOVER: Integrated Data Science Training in CardioVascular Medicine Abstract: This new T32 proposal will support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows pursuing integrated data science training in cardiovascular (CV) medicine at UCLA. Integrated data science training programs are very limited in today’s CV biomedical community. Data science challenges facing CV medicine are in many ways unique and have a long historic track record of information and data. CV diseases are chronic, heterogeneous disorders that exhibit distinct temporal profiles combined with multi-organ alterations, necessitating novel analysis platforms that integrate findings across expanded continuums of diverse information (e.g., text, imaging, omics). The complexity and size of CV datasets have pushed computational approaches to their limits, thus attenuating the rate for adding value in CV medicine. To this end, there is broad consensus that we must merge data science with CV medicine. The creation of a next-generation workforce having more advanced understanding of data science tactics for addressing real-world CV problems will ultimately realize precision CV medicine. Our T32 fills a unique niche in CV data science that is currently missing, both at UCLA and nationally. The UCLA Integrated Data Science Training in CV Medicine (iDISCOVER) Program draws upon faculty from the UCLA Schools of Medicine and Engineering, to establish a program for trainees committed to intensive data science applications in CV medicine. We have a substantiated track record in establishing training programs, as evidenced by our NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative, Heart BD2K Center at UCLA. Experience has enabled us to construct a T32 research program targeting the most pressing data science questions in CV medicine. Our two-year program will accept qualified students who have completed 1st year PhD training from Computer Science (CS), Bioinformatics (BI) or Bioengineering (BE); and eligible postdoc fellows from elite CV programs. We will train predoctoral students during their second and third year of PhD training, and postdoctoral fellows during their first and second year of their fellowship. Trainees will engage in advanced coursework within the specific focus areas: (i) omics phenotyping-supported outcome studies; (ii) machine learning-supported approaches in CV medicine; and (iii) information indexing and knowledgebase construction. Trainees will engage in CV clinical rotations to give them exposure to pressing CV data science questions. Trainees will be guided by a co-mentoring arrangement (1 CV mentor and 1 data science mentor). We have an outstanding group of 14 core faculty and 6 clinical supporting faculty members in the UCLA Schools of Medicine, Engineering and Life Sciences. Our faculty have established, vibrant and well-funded research programs with strong histories of guiding students to successful careers. Our program promotes the training of underrepresented minority groups, as demonstrated by training records of all faculty. Our iDISCOVER program has the institutional backing from Schools of Medicine, Engineering, Grad Division, Depts. of CS, BI, and BE, as well as Cardiology and Physiology. These elements ensure solid support for program implementation, advancement and success.

"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification. This is particularly important for science, given the fact that students from high- poverty schools are economically disadvantaged and may comprise a large proportion of individuals from minority groups that are underrepresented in science.",Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram,9458539,R25ES028974,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Case Study', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High School Faculty', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'K-12 Faculty', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Program Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'STEM career', 'School Teachers', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'apprenticeship', 'base', 'college', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'exposure route', 'health literacy', 'health science research', 'high school program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experience', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pedagogical content', 'programs', 'response', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'stressor', 'summer research', 'teacher', 'tool']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2018,99506,0.04979110174244041
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side.

"Biomedical Informatics Training at Stanford Biomedical Informatics Training at Stanford 7. Project Summary/Abstract: The opportunities for creating new methods to advance biomedical discovery are unprecedented. Since 1982, the Stanford Biomedical Informatics (BMI) training program has granted PhD and MS degrees to students with intensive training that prepares them for careers in research. It now benefits from the creation of a new Department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford, for which it will be the primary graduate training program. The formal BMI curriculum consists of (1) Core BMI, (2) Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics and Engineering, (3) Ethical, Social, Legal Implications of technology, and (4) Domain biology or medicine. The curriculum is appropriate for research training in Translational Bioinformatics (TB, including environmental exposure informatics), Health care/clinical informatics (HC), and Clinical Research Informatics (CR).

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems.

"An Interdisciplinary Program for Advanced Training in Health Data Analytics The proposed training program adds predoctoral and postdoctoral training to the Carolina Health Informatics Program (CHIP), which concentrates on both advancing research and training in biomedical and health informatics. CHIP is a truly interdisciplinary program co- created and co-sponsored by 1) School of Medicine, 2) Gillings School of Global Public Health, 3) School of Nursing, 4) Eshelman School of Pharmacy, 5) School of Dentistry, 6) School of Information & Library Science, and 7) Computer Science Department of the College of Arts & Sciences. The program is further strengthened by close partnerships with area health care organizations and companies specializing in biopharmaceuticals, heath care, IT and analytics. Recognizing the many challenges associated with health data analytics and use, the three foundational aspects of the CHIP training programs are: 1) Methods for health data analytics, 2) Building powerful interactive analytics systems that allow customization and support decision making for a wide variety of health care operations, and 3) Addressing translational challenges in implementing and managing information systems that leverage health data analytics effectively. Given that CHIP is a highly interdisciplinary program, it will draw upon its diverse faculty, research centers, laboratories, and other rich resources to develop three major types of activities as part of the proposed advanced predoctoral and postdoctoral training program. The three activities are: 1) Research methods and analytics techniques for clinical data science, imaging informatics, precision medicine, and big data analytics for population health, 2) Didactic learning based on courses in machine learning, biostatistics, big data management, and visual analytics and additional courses that are rooted in realistic health care problems, and 3) Large- scale, population-oriented system development, deployment, and outcome evaluation. Improving human health by leveraging health data analytics demands that the critical problems and development of solutions are approached from a broad perspective, carefully taking into account evidence ranging from molecular-scale to population-scale and drawing upon knowledge from biostatistics, information science, and computing.

"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program. We aim to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by preparing PREP Scholars for the rigors and challenges of a biomedical doctoral degree program so that they will successfully obtain a PhD degree or MD/PhD degree and contribute their expertise to the biomedical scientific community.",LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences,9208463,R25GM121189,"['Academic Training', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data Analyses', 'Degree program', 'Dentistry', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Extramural Activities', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Historically Black Colleges and Universities', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Louisiana', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Enrollment', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Oral', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Study Skills', 'Sum', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'gulf coast', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'member', 'minority communities', 'novel', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'role model', 'science education', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student', 'university student']",NIGMS,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R25,2017,255172,0.11445169665147038
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9270644,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2017,313812,0.10228475983831398
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,9253392,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Education', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium', 'translation to humans']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2017,1728654,0.0313245107697571
"Integrative Neuronal Systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Brain and Cognitive Sciences Graduate Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests renewal of its major training grant. The department is organized to promote interdisciplinary training and research in neuroscience and behavior, approached with the experimental power of modern molecular and cellular neuroscience, systems neuroscience, and cognitive science, combined with the theoretical strength of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Trainees begin laboratory work through lab rotations in the first two terms and subsequently join a laboratory, working on problems in learning and memory, neural development, vision, motor control or brain disorders and diseases. Required course work can be completed in two to three years, with a two-term sequence of core courses in the first year, a quantitative methods course, and a flexible array of graduate lecture courses and seminar classes. The qualifying exam consists of written and oral components of an interdisciplinary NIH/NSF style grant proposal. Annual research reports and annual committee meetings are required, and mark the student's progress in research through completion of a thesis. Multiple presentations at professional meetings and journal publications are typically expected of a dissertation. Most students continue in research careers, armed with skills that typically span multiple theoretical and experimental approaches comprising molecular/cellular neuroscience, systems neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysics, behavior and computation. Trainees will, in general, have strong backgrounds in the natural sciences (e.g., undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, or electrical engineering). Occasional trainees will already hold a master's degree in another field. Candidates for the graduate program will be chosen by the department Graduate Committee constituted for the purpose of overseeing this program and will be evaluated on the basis of interviews, talent for research as demonstrated by past performance, letters of recommendation, grades, and GRE scores. Funds are requested for five years to support 12 predoctoral trainees per year. MIT's Integrative Neuronal Systems program provides interdisciplinary training for graduate students pursuing research careers related to the understanding of the human brain and mind.

"Biomedical Data Science Graduate Training at Stanford ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The expanded ability to collect data at all scales-molecular, cellular, tissue, organism and population-has created unparalleled opportunities for biomedical discovery. These opportunities cross all areas of research from basic science to clinical care. In response to these tremendously exciting emerging challenges in data science, Stanford University announced the creation of a new Department of Biomedical Data Science (DBDS) to begin in fall of 2015. Fundamental to the DBDS is bringing together faculty in (1) informatics and computer science, and (2) biostatistics and mathematical modeling, who work closely with a broad range of (3) biomedical science collaborators to advance knowledge. The Stanford Biomedical Informatics (BMI) training program is focused on the creation of new methods for the organization, analysis and modeling of biomedical data and knowledge. The BMI program has been a small interdisciplinary program at Stanford for more than 33 years; nonetheless, it has produced many leaders in biomedical informatics and data science. The BMI program will now have its administrative home in the DBDS, and will become the epicenter for biomedical data science training at Stanford. We are able quickly to respond to the shortage of trained scientists in biomedical data science because of a flexible curriculum, an unusually fertile set of course offerings, and a plethora of research opportunities. In this proposal, we outline a plan to engage faculty broadly across the University to create scalable mechanisms for training the next generation of biomedical data scientists, and creating a pathway for ""data science"" within the BMI program that stresses statistical reasoning, machine learning and data mining of biomedical data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our ability to collect large amounts of data at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organism, and population levels creates fantastic opportunities for discovery in health. We propose a plan for training scientists with skills to harness these data and turn them into valuable knowledge for biology and medicine.",Biomedical Data Science Graduate Training at Stanford,9248421,T32LM012409,"['Data Science', 'Training']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,T32,2017,298785,0.05173976539514726
"Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The successful training program in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) has been transferred from the MIT-Harvard Division of Health Sciences and Technology to the Harvard Medical School Division of Medical Sciences (DMS). This entails incremental changes in the curriculum, because of full cross-registration and a change in focus of the clinical experience away from general physiology and towards medical genetic clinics, and clinical genetics laboratory experience. BIG continues to focus on the growing gap between the ability to generate copious amounts genomic data and the ability to systematically and efficiently make sense of all this data, particularly for clinical relevance. Ths program admits students with proven excellence in quantitative science and seeks to train competent, multi-disciplinary investigators who are capable of both integrating the genome-scale technologies into their experimental investigations, and synthesizing the resulting datasets into coherent knowledge frameworks and mathematical models for formulating and resolving fundamental questions in biology and medicine.  The BIG training program draws on three significant strengths of the local academic environment: the breadth of talented investigators at Harvard, the Medical School and affiliated hospitals, and MIT, the rich variety of quantitatively-oriented courses in advanced genomics-bioinformatics offered at Harvard and MIT, and national leadership of BIG faculty in harnessing clinical processes and electronic health records for genome-scale disease research. As a new track within DMS, the BIG pre-doctoral program provides a three legged curriculum: 1) rigorous course work in machine learning, probability theory, decision science, and biostatistics 2) in-depth courses that include the range of genome-scale measurements applied to population studies, clinical medicine and basic biology 3) survey of the larger scope of biomedical sciences as well as a rich, unique clinical experience focused on genetics clinics and genetic laboratory testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrating genomics into the practice of medicine and biomedical research is a primary goal of the National Human Genome Research Institute's strategic plan. The Harvard University Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Program meets this goal by providing students trained in the quantitative sciences the intellectual tools t integrate genomics with medical science, access to ""big data"" from healthcare systems to experiment with methods of leveraging healthcare data in genomic science, faculty who are leading efforts to integrate genome-scale results into clinical practice, and faculty who are expert in genomics and bioinformatics.",Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics,9339714,T32HG002295,"['Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Training']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,T32,2017,663145,0.012457357041680514
"University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data for Genomics and Neuroscience ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Washington conducts world-class research in the development of big data analytics, as well as in many areas of biomedical research. However, most predoctoral students in biomedical science do not receive cutting-edge training in statistical and computational methods for big data. Furthermore, most predoctoral students in statistics and computing do not receive in-depth training in biomedical science. In short, the university currently lacks an integrated training program that spans computation, statistics, and biomedical science. Given the growing importance of big data across many areas of biomedical research, such an integrated program is critically needed.  In order to train a new generation of researchers with expertise in statistics, computing, and biomedical science, we propose the University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data from Genomics and Neuroscience (BDGN). This program will focus on two areas of biomedical science, both of which are characterized by huge amounts of data as well as extensive expertise at the University of Washington: genomics and neuroscience. The program will draw six predoctoral students per year from the following seven PhD programs: Applied Mathematics, Biology, Biostatistics, Computer Science & Engineering, Genome Sciences, Neuroscience, and Statistics. Trainees will be appointed to the training grant during their ﬁrst or second year of hD studies and will continue on the training grant for two years. They will take a rigorous curriculum that involves three courses in statistics, machine learning, and data science, and three courses in either genomics or neuroscience. Each trainee will be paired with two world-class faculty mentors: one specializing in either genomics or neuroscience, and a second specializing in the development of either computational or statistical methods for big data. Other key features of the training program include three one-quarter rotations, with at least one focusing on genomics or neuroscience and one focusing on statistical or computational methods, a summer internship program, opportunities to attend world-class summer courses run through UW programs, peer mentoring, seminars, journal clubs, and courses on reproducible research and on responsible conduct of research. All predoctoral trainees will leave the BDGN Training Program with a core set of skills and a common language required for generating, interpreting, and developing statistical and computational methods for big data from genomics or neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies in biomedical research have led to the generation of very large data sets, such as DNA sequences and fMRI images. However, in order to use these big data sets to improve scientiﬁc understanding and human health, there is a need for a new generation of biomedical scientists with interdisciplinary training that spans three areas: computer science, statistics, and biomedicine. The proposed program will provide predoctoral training for students engaged in big data research in genomics and neuroscience at the University of Washington.",University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data for Genomics and Neuroscience,9339731,T32LM012419,"['Big Data', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Neurosciences', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'genomic data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,T32,2017,303645,0.012648760578137665
"Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of our new, multidisciplinary institutional training program, based in the Schools of Medicine and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, is to train pre-doctoral engineering students and physician postdoctoral fellows in Neuroengineering and its clinical translation. Disorders of the nervous system, such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, depression, dementia, and head trauma, constitute 35% of all disease and disability, and the burden is rising. There is an explosion of promising therapies for these disorders in new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate neural circuits, but translating these therapies from the laboratory to patients is a challenge. It requires talented engineers educated in clinical science and technically proficient physicians who speak the same language. Together these investigators must navigate a complex scientific, regulatory, and clinical landscape. Despite the huge demand, few formal, interdisciplinary Neuroengineering training programs exist.  We propose a new program shared by the Penn Schools of Medicine and Engineering focused on Neuroengineering and Clinical Translation. Physician and Engineering trainees will together become fluent in cutting-edge technologies at the forefront of Neuroengineering, such as devices, neurostimulation, machine learning, and algorithm development; cloud computing, nanotechnology and materials science. They will innovate new therapies for human disease and gain a thorough understanding of the clinical, regulatory, and developmental environments necessary to safely bring new technologies to patients. The program's core is a group of collaborative, multidisciplinary faculty mentors in engineering and the clinical neurosciences. In addition to dedicated neuroengineering research, our training program includes: (1) a longitudinal mentored clinical experience for PhD candidates, (2) engineering lab immersion and tutorial for MD postdoctoral fellows, (3) formal courses and seminars in Engineering, Neuroscience and Medicine, (4) training in the proper conduct of research, and (5) workshops on professional and career development, including scientific writing, public presentations, grant writing, and laboratory management. The program will recruit from an excellent pool of ~50 MD fellows and 80-90 PhD students each year. This effort formalizes a collaboration that has trained an impressive array of Neuroengineering investigators over the past twelve years. The program, unique at Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment, including a compact campus where robust centers for Engineering, Medicine and Neuroscience all reside within two blocks of each other, united through Penn's new Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine Disorders of the nervous system represent one of the largest, fastest growing areas of medical need in the United States. The most promising therapies for these disorders are new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate activity in neural circuits. There is a great need for engineers educated in clinical neuroscience and physicians with technical backgrounds to train and work together, to effectively bring these critical technologies to patient care. The goal of this multidisciplinary program is to train pre-doctoral Engineering students, and post-doctoral MD and MD-PhD fellows together in Neuroengineering research, and its translation to clinical care.",Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine,9301052,T32NS091006,"['Medicine', 'Training Programs']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,T32,2017,252120,0.12477078078434722
"Integrated Biostatistical Training for CVD Research Project Title: Integrated Biostatistical Training for CVD Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This application proposes renewal of a novel, integrated program for predoctoral training in biostatistics focused on preparing trainees for careers in cardiovascular disease research. The escalating demand for skilled biostatisticians equipped to address ongoing and emerging challenges in this exciting era of cardiovascular disease research calls for training that formally integrates deep and sustained experience in collaboration in a multidisciplinary environment, mastery of the theoretical underpinnings of statistics required for valid application of sophisticated biostatistical techniques and for research on development of new methodology, and strong emphasis on communication and leadership skills. The program will be a joint effort of the Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University (NCSU), the Duke University Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (B&B), and the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI). It capitalizes on the long-standing partnership between the two departments and a medical research institution that is the largest Academic Research Organization in the world, with internationally known researchers at the forefront of cardiovascular disease and related research. The five-year program will support five (5) trainee positions in the NCSU Department and one (1) position in Years 1 and 2 and two (2) in Years 3-5 in Duke B&B. In addition, NCSU, Duke, and DCRI will provide two, one, and two matching positions in each year, respectively. Trainees at each institution will pursue rigorous study of statistical theory, including probability, inference, linear and other statistical models, advanced probability, and advanced statistical inference; and of statistical methods, including clinical trials design/analysis, longitudinal data analysis, survival analysis, and cutting-edge topics, such as record linkage, machine learning, parallel computing relevant to biomedical Big Data. They will also receive training in fundamental aspects of biology and cardiovascular medicine as well as research responsibility and ethics; and extensive formal and experiential training in communication and leadership skills. Trainees will be introduced to DCRI cardiovascular disease research gradually and evolve to full collaborative apprenticeships in which they are integrated as functioning members of DCRI project teams. Through this apprenticeship and formal courses and seminars, trainees will develop considerable working knowledge of cardiovascular medicine that will position them to make immediate contributions to cardiovascular disease research upon completion of the program. Each trainee will be assigned an inter-institutional mentorship team comprising a biostatistician mentor at each of NCSU and B&B and a clinician mentor whose primary affiliation is at DCRI, which will collaborate in guiding them through all aspects. Dissertation research will involve development and evaluation of novel statistical methodology inspired by challenges encountered in trainees' collaborations. Trainees will benefit from exposure to different cultures across both institutions, broadening their perspectives and access to courses, seminars, and other resources. ! Project Title: Integrated Biostatistical Training for CVD Research PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are key contributors to cardiovascular disease research, and demand continues to escalate for PhD biostatisticians with the required training, particularly in this era of biomedical big data. This program will provide up to 10 predoctoral students per year at North Carolina State University and Duke University with unique training that integrates rigorous study of statistical theory and methods with a collaborative apprenticeship working on cutting edge cardiovascular disease research studies in multidisciplinary teams at Duke Clinical Research Institute to prepare them to make immediate contributions to the cardiovascular disease research enterprise.",Integrated Biostatistical Training for CVD Research,9357910,T32HL079896,"['Biometry', 'Research', 'Training']",NHLBI,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,T32,2017,270773,0.055450020162317315
"Physics and Biology in Medicine Research Training Abstract: The specific aim of this training grant's competitive renewal proposal is to continue the development of research scientists that are well versed in physics, biology, mathematics, chemistry, engineering and computer science, who also understand the application of these disciplines to the detection, diagnosis and assessment of treatment of disease. While the focus of this training program is the UCLA Physics and Biology in Medicine (formerly Biomedical Physics) Interdepartmental Graduate Program, the training program is not limited to the traditional practice of Medical Physics and is much broader in scope. This training program has four tracks. The Medical Imaging track investigates the physics of diagnostic radiology modalities (e.g. MRI, MR Spectroscopy, CT) and Computer Vision methods to investigate areas such as quantitative imaging, imaging biomarkers and Radiomics (as well as correlation with genomic factors – Imaging Genomics) all of which seek to extract additional information from image data and relate it to other key information about patients and disease. The Molecular Imaging track investigates a wide range of topics including the physics of PET, optical and combined imaging modalities, immuno-PET, the chemistry and biology of novel imaging tracers, microfluidics, nanotechnology and others all focused on providing investigations of basic biological mechanisms, both normal and pathological. This includes investigations with applications in oncology (including responses to immunotherapies), traumatic brain injury, neurodegeneration and other conditions. The Molecular and Cellular Oncology track investigates the molecular, cellular, and tissue-related effects of radiation. This also includes a wide range of topics from Radiation Genomics (Radiogenomics) which explores genetic components of both radiation sensitivity and radiation resistance, the role of the immune system in response to radiation, cancer stem cells and radiation response as well as signal transduction pathways and their influence on radiation response. The Therapeutic Medical Physics track investigates novel approaches to treatment delivery systems including methods to improve the accuracy of treatment delivery such as breathing motion models for real time MRI guided treatment delivery to 4π treatment methods and brachytherapy. This program has been training primarily Ph.D. students for more than 60 years (40 years with this training grant), and is unique in that it brings together researchers from basic sciences with investigators in the clinical translational sciences and physicians who are truly clinical researchers, all in a common environment dedicated to bringing basic research to clinical applications. This program has the faculty, students, infrastructure and backing of its supporting Departments (Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Radiological Sciences and Radiation Oncology) as well as the newly formed Graduate Programs in Biosciences to continue to achieve its goals of training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE This training grant aims to continue to develop research scientists that are well versed in physics, biology, mathematics, chemistry, engineering and computer science, who also understand the application of these disciplines to the instruments and techniques used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of disease as well as research fields that help us understand basic mechanisms of disease. These scientists will become actively involved in research into new methods that seek earlier diagnosis of disease as well as more specific (patient specific, disease specific) treatments of disease in many clinical applications.",Physics and Biology in Medicine Research Training,9280104,T32EB002101,"['Biology', 'Medicine', 'Physics', 'Research Training']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,T32,2017,256098,0.09251621091400014

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance.

"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9128789,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Organ failure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2016,423432,0.10228475983831398
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,9044557,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health education', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health science research', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2016,1729509,0.0313245107697571
"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems.

"Integrative Neuronal Systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Brain and Cognitive Sciences Graduate Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests renewal of its major training grant. The department is organized to promote interdisciplinary training and research in neuroscience and behavior, approached with the experimental power of modern molecular and cellular neuroscience, systems neuroscience, and cognitive science, combined with the theoretical strength of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Trainees begin laboratory work through lab rotations in the first two terms and subsequently join a laboratory, working on problems in learning and memory, neural development, vision, motor control or brain disorders and diseases. Required course work can be completed in two to three years, with a two-term sequence of core courses in the first year, a quantitative methods course, and a flexible array of graduate lecture courses and seminar classes. The qualifying exam consists of written and oral components of an interdisciplinary NIH/NSF style grant proposal. Annual research reports and annual committee meetings are required, and mark the student's progress in research through completion of a thesis. Multiple presentations at professional meetings and journal publications are typically expected of a dissertation. Most students continue in research careers, armed with skills that typically span multiple theoretical and experimental approaches comprising molecular/cellular neuroscience, systems neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysics, behavior and computation. Trainees will, in general, have strong backgrounds in the natural sciences (e.g., undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, or electrical engineering). Occasional trainees will already hold a master's degree in another field. Candidates for the graduate program will be chosen by the department Graduate Committee constituted for the purpose of overseeing this program and will be evaluated on the basis of interviews, talent for research as demonstrated by past performance, letters of recommendation, grades, and GRE scores. Funds are requested for five years to support 12 predoctoral trainees per year. MIT's Integrative Neuronal Systems program provides interdisciplinary training for graduate students pursuing research careers related to the understanding of the human brain and mind.

"Biomedical Data Science Graduate Training at Stanford ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The expanded ability to collect data at all scales-molecular, cellular, tissue, organism and population-has created unparalleled opportunities for biomedical discovery. These opportunities cross all areas of research from basic science to clinical care. In response to these tremendously exciting emerging challenges in data science, Stanford University announced the creation of a new Department of Biomedical Data Science (DBDS) to begin in fall of 2015. Fundamental to the DBDS is bringing together faculty in (1) informatics and computer science, and (2) biostatistics and mathematical modeling, who work closely with a broad range of (3) biomedical science collaborators to advance knowledge. The Stanford Biomedical Informatics (BMI) training program is focused on the creation of new methods for the organization, analysis and modeling of biomedical data and knowledge. The BMI program has been a small interdisciplinary program at Stanford for more than 33 years; nonetheless, it has produced many leaders in biomedical informatics and data science. The BMI program will now have its administrative home in the DBDS, and will become the epicenter for biomedical data science training at Stanford. We are able quickly to respond to the shortage of trained scientists in biomedical data science because of a flexible curriculum, an unusually fertile set of course offerings, and a plethora of research opportunities. In this proposal, we outline a plan to engage faculty broadly across the University to create scalable mechanisms for training the next generation of biomedical data scientists, and creating a pathway for ""data science"" within the BMI program that stresses statistical reasoning, machine learning and data mining of biomedical data.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our ability to collect large amounts of data at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organism, and population levels creates fantastic opportunities for discovery in health. We propose a plan for training scientists with skills to harness these data and turn them into valuable knowledge for biology and medicine.        ",Biomedical Data Science Graduate Training at Stanford,9117248,T32LM012409,"['Data Science', 'Training']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,T32,2016,295752,0.05173976539514726
"Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The successful training program in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) has been transferred from the MIT-Harvard Division of Health Sciences and Technology to the Harvard Medical School Division of Medical Sciences (DMS). This entails incremental changes in the curriculum, because of full cross-registration and a change in focus of the clinical experience away from general physiology and towards medical genetic clinics, and clinical genetics laboratory experience. BIG continues to focus on the growing gap between the ability to generate copious amounts genomic data and the ability to systematically and efficiently make sense of all this data, particularly for clinical relevance. Ths program admits students with proven excellence in quantitative science and seeks to train competent, multi-disciplinary investigators who are capable of both integrating the genome-scale technologies into their experimental investigations, and synthesizing the resulting datasets into coherent knowledge frameworks and mathematical models for formulating and resolving fundamental questions in biology and medicine.  The BIG training program draws on three significant strengths of the local academic environment: the breadth of talented investigators at Harvard, the Medical School and affiliated hospitals, and MIT, the rich variety of quantitatively-oriented courses in advanced genomics-bioinformatics offered at Harvard and MIT, and national leadership of BIG faculty in harnessing clinical processes and electronic health records for genome-scale disease research. As a new track within DMS, the BIG pre-doctoral program provides a three legged curriculum: 1) rigorous course work in machine learning, probability theory, decision science, and biostatistics 2) in-depth courses that include the range of genome-scale measurements applied to population studies, clinical medicine and basic biology 3) survey of the larger scope of biomedical sciences as well as a rich, unique clinical experience focused on genetics clinics and genetic laboratory testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrating genomics into the practice of medicine and biomedical research is a primary goal of the National Human Genome Research Institute's strategic plan. The Harvard University Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Program meets this goal by providing students trained in the quantitative sciences the intellectual tools t integrate genomics with medical science, access to ""big data"" from healthcare systems to experiment with methods of leveraging healthcare data in genomic science, faculty who are leading efforts to integrate genome-scale results into clinical practice, and faculty who are expert in genomics and bioinformatics.",Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics,9128453,T32HG002295,"['Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Training']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,T32,2016,656069,0.012457357041680514
"University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data for Genomics and Neuroscience ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Washington conducts world-class research in the development of big data analytics, as well as in many areas of biomedical research. However, most predoctoral students in biomedical science do not receive cutting-edge training in statistical and computational methods for big data. Furthermore, most predoctoral students in statistics and computing do not receive in-depth training in biomedical science. In short, the university currently lacks an integrated training program that spans computation, statistics, and biomedical science. Given the growing importance of big data across many areas of biomedical research, such an integrated program is critically needed.  In order to train a new generation of researchers with expertise in statistics, computing, and biomedical science, we propose the University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data from Genomics and Neuroscience (BDGN). This program will focus on two areas of biomedical science, both of which are characterized by huge amounts of data as well as extensive expertise at the University of Washington: genomics and neuroscience. The program will draw six predoctoral students per year from the following seven PhD programs: Applied Mathematics, Biology, Biostatistics, Computer Science & Engineering, Genome Sciences, Neuroscience, and Statistics. Trainees will be appointed to the training grant during their ﬁrst or second year of hD studies and will continue on the training grant for two years. They will take a rigorous curriculum that involves three courses in statistics, machine learning, and data science, and three courses in either genomics or neuroscience. Each trainee will be paired with two world-class faculty mentors: one specializing in either genomics or neuroscience, and a second specializing in the development of either computational or statistical methods for big data. Other key features of the training program include three one-quarter rotations, with at least one focusing on genomics or neuroscience and one focusing on statistical or computational methods, a summer internship program, opportunities to attend world-class summer courses run through UW programs, peer mentoring, seminars, journal clubs, and courses on reproducible research and on responsible conduct of research. All predoctoral trainees will leave the BDGN Training Program with a core set of skills and a common language required for generating, interpreting, and developing statistical and computational methods for big data from genomics or neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies in biomedical research have led to the generation of very large data sets, such as DNA sequences and fMRI images. However, in order to use these big data sets to improve scientiﬁc understanding and human health, there is a need for a new generation of biomedical scientists with interdisciplinary training that spans three areas: computer science, statistics, and biomedicine.

"Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of our new, multidisciplinary institutional training program, based in the Schools of Medicine and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, is to train pre-doctoral engineering students and physician postdoctoral fellows in Neuroengineering and its clinical translation. Disorders of the nervous system, such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, depression, dementia, and head trauma, constitute 35% of all disease and disability, and the burden is rising. There is an explosion of promising therapies for these disorders in new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate neural circuits, but translating these therapies from the laboratory to patients is a challenge. It requires talented engineers educated in clinical science and technically proficient physicians who speak the same language. Together these investigators must navigate a complex scientific, regulatory, and clinical landscape. Despite the huge demand, few formal, interdisciplinary Neuroengineering training programs exist.  We propose a new program shared by the Penn Schools of Medicine and Engineering focused on Neuroengineering and Clinical Translation. Physician and Engineering trainees will together become fluent in cutting-edge technologies at the forefront of Neuroengineering, such as devices, neurostimulation, machine learning, and algorithm development; cloud computing, nanotechnology and materials science. They will innovate new therapies for human disease and gain a thorough understanding of the clinical, regulatory, and developmental environments necessary to safely bring new technologies to patients. The program's core is a group of collaborative, multidisciplinary faculty mentors in engineering and the clinical neurosciences. In addition to dedicated neuroengineering research, our training program includes: (1) a longitudinal mentored clinical experience for PhD candidates, (2) engineering lab immersion and tutorial for MD postdoctoral fellows, (3) formal courses and seminars in Engineering, Neuroscience and Medicine, (4) training in the proper conduct of research, and (5) workshops on professional and career development, including scientific writing, public presentations, grant writing, and laboratory management. The program will recruit from an excellent pool of ~50 MD fellows and 80-90 PhD students each year.

"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9085705,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'success', 'translational medicine']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2015,388145,0.10228475983831398

Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems.

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8832593,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health education', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health science research', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2015,1735289,0.0313245107697571
"Integrative Neuronal Systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Brain and Cognitive Sciences Graduate Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests renewal of its major training grant. The department is organized to promote interdisciplinary training and research in neuroscience and behavior, approached with the experimental power of modern molecular and cellular neuroscience, systems neuroscience, and cognitive science, combined with the theoretical strength of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Trainees begin laboratory work through lab rotations in the first two terms and subsequently join a laboratory, working on problems in learning and memory, neural development, vision, motor control or brain disorders and diseases. Required course work can be completed in two to three years, with a two-term sequence of core courses in the first year, a quantitative methods course, and a flexible array of graduate lecture courses and seminar classes. The qualifying exam consists of written and oral components of an interdisciplinary NIH/NSF style grant proposal. Annual research reports and annual committee meetings are required, and mark the student's progress in research through completion of a thesis. Multiple presentations at professional meetings and journal publications are typically expected of a dissertation. Most students continue in research careers, armed with skills that typically span multiple theoretical and experimental approaches comprising molecular/cellular neuroscience, systems neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysics, behavior and computation. Trainees will, in general, have strong backgrounds in the natural sciences (e.g., undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, or electrical engineering). Occasional trainees will already hold a master's degree in another field. Candidates for the graduate program will be chosen by the department Graduate Committee constituted for the purpose of overseeing this program and will be evaluated on the basis of interviews, talent for research as demonstrated by past performance, letters of recommendation, grades, and GRE scores. Funds are requested for five years to support 12 predoctoral trainees per year. MIT's Integrative Neuronal Systems program provides interdisciplinary training for graduate students pursuing research careers related to the understanding of the human brain and mind.

"Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The successful training program in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) has been transferred from the MIT-Harvard Division of Health Sciences and Technology to the Harvard Medical School Division of Medical Sciences (DMS). This entails incremental changes in the curriculum, because of full cross-registration and a change in focus of the clinical experience away from general physiology and towards medical genetic clinics, and clinical genetics laboratory experience. BIG continues to focus on the growing gap between the ability to generate copious amounts genomic data and the ability to systematically and efficiently make sense of all this data, particularly for clinical relevance. Ths program admits students with proven excellence in quantitative science and seeks to train competent, multi-disciplinary investigators who are capable of both integrating the genome-scale technologies into their experimental investigations, and synthesizing the resulting datasets into coherent knowledge frameworks and mathematical models for formulating and resolving fundamental questions in biology and medicine.  The BIG training program draws on three significant strengths of the local academic environment: the breadth of talented investigators at Harvard, the Medical School and affiliated hospitals, and MIT, the rich variety of quantitatively-oriented courses in advanced genomics-bioinformatics offered at Harvard and MIT, and national leadership of BIG faculty in harnessing clinical processes and electronic health records for genome-scale disease research. As a new track within DMS, the BIG pre-doctoral program provides a three legged curriculum: 1) rigorous course work in machine learning, probability theory, decision science, and biostatistics 2) in-depth courses that include the range of genome-scale measurements applied to population studies, clinical medicine and basic biology 3) survey of the larger scope of biomedical sciences as well as a rich, unique clinical experience focused on genetics clinics and genetic laboratory testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrating genomics into the practice of medicine and biomedical research is a primary goal of the National Human Genome Research Institute's strategic plan. The Harvard University Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Program meets this goal by providing students trained in the quantitative sciences the intellectual tools t integrate genomics with medical science, access to ""big data"" from healthcare systems to experiment with methods of leveraging healthcare data in genomic science, faculty who are leading efforts to integrate genome-scale results into clinical practice, and faculty who are expert in genomics and bioinformatics.",Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics,8919720,T32HG002295,"['Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Training']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,T32,2015,267469,0.012457357041680514
"University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data for Genomics and Neuroscience ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Washington conducts world-class research in the development of big data analytics, as well as in many areas of biomedical research. However, most predoctoral students in biomedical science do not receive cutting-edge training in statistical and computational methods for big data. Furthermore, most predoctoral students in statistics and computing do not receive in-depth training in biomedical science. In short, the university currently lacks an integrated training program that spans computation, statistics, and biomedical science. Given the growing importance of big data across many areas of biomedical research, such an integrated program is critically needed.  In order to train a new generation of researchers with expertise in statistics, computing, and biomedical science, we propose the University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data from Genomics and Neuroscience (BDGN). This program will focus on two areas of biomedical science, both of which are characterized by huge amounts of data as well as extensive expertise at the University of Washington: genomics and neuroscience. The program will draw six predoctoral students per year from the following seven PhD programs: Applied Mathematics, Biology, Biostatistics, Computer Science & Engineering, Genome Sciences, Neuroscience, and Statistics. Trainees will be appointed to the training grant during their ﬁrst or second year of hD studies and will continue on the training grant for two years. They will take a rigorous curriculum that involves three courses in statistics, machine learning, and data science, and three courses in either genomics or neuroscience. Each trainee will be paired with two world-class faculty mentors: one specializing in either genomics or neuroscience, and a second specializing in the development of either computational or statistical methods for big data. Other key features of the training program include three one-quarter rotations, with at least one focusing on genomics or neuroscience and one focusing on statistical or computational methods, a summer internship program, opportunities to attend world-class summer courses run through UW programs, peer mentoring, seminars, journal clubs, and courses on reproducible research and on responsible conduct of research. All predoctoral trainees will leave the BDGN Training Program with a core set of skills and a common language required for generating, interpreting, and developing statistical and computational methods for big data from genomics or neuroscience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies in biomedical research have led to the generation of very large data sets, such as DNA sequences and fMRI images. However, in order to use these big data sets to improve scientiﬁc understanding and human health, there is a need for a new generation of biomedical scientists with interdisciplinary training that spans three areas: computer science, statistics, and biomedicine. The proposed program will provide predoctoral training for students engaged in big data research in genomics and neuroscience at the University of Washington.            ",University of Washington PhD Training in Big Data for Genomics and Neuroscience,9024828,T32CA206089,"['Big Data', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Genomics', 'Neurosciences', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,T32,2015,285970,0.012648760578137665
"Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of our new, multidisciplinary institutional training program, based in the Schools of Medicine and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, is to train pre-doctoral engineering students and physician postdoctoral fellows in Neuroengineering and its clinical translation. Disorders of the nervous system, such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, depression, dementia, and head trauma, constitute 35% of all disease and disability, and the burden is rising. There is an explosion of promising therapies for these disorders in new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate neural circuits, but translating these therapies from the laboratory to patients is a challenge. It requires talented engineers educated in clinical science and technically proficient physicians who speak the same language. Together these investigators must navigate a complex scientific, regulatory, and clinical landscape. Despite the huge demand, few formal, interdisciplinary Neuroengineering training programs exist.  We propose a new program shared by the Penn Schools of Medicine and Engineering focused on Neuroengineering and Clinical Translation. Physician and Engineering trainees will together become fluent in cutting-edge technologies at the forefront of Neuroengineering, such as devices, neurostimulation, machine learning, and algorithm development; cloud computing, nanotechnology and materials science. They will innovate new therapies for human disease and gain a thorough understanding of the clinical, regulatory, and developmental environments necessary to safely bring new technologies to patients. The program's core is a group of collaborative, multidisciplinary faculty mentors in engineering and the clinical neurosciences. In addition to dedicated neuroengineering research, our training program includes: (1) a longitudinal mentored clinical experience for PhD candidates, (2) engineering lab immersion and tutorial for MD postdoctoral fellows, (3) formal courses and seminars in Engineering, Neuroscience and Medicine, (4) training in the proper conduct of research, and (5) workshops on professional and career development, including scientific writing, public presentations, grant writing, and laboratory management. The program will recruit from an excellent pool of ~50 MD fellows and 80-90 PhD students each year. This effort formalizes a collaboration that has trained an impressive array of Neuroengineering investigators over the past twelve years. The program, unique at Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment, including a compact campus where robust centers for Engineering, Medicine and Neuroscience all reside within two blocks of each other, united through Penn's new Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine Disorders of the nervous system represent one of the largest, fastest growing areas of medical need in the United States. The most promising therapies for these disorders are new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate activity in neural circuits. There is a great need for engineers educated in clinical neuroscience and physicians with technical backgrounds to train and work together, to effectively bring these critical technologies to patient care. The goal of this multidisciplinary program is to train pre-doctoral Engineering students, and post-doctoral MD and MD-PhD fellows together in Neuroengineering research, and its translation to clinical care.                ",Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine,8854679,T32NS091006,"['Medicine', 'Training Programs']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,T32,2015,233455,0.12477078078434722
"Training Program in Computational Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational and quantitative methods are now an essential part of biological research. There is an urgent need for scientists who are expert in both computational and life sciences. We propose to continue addressing this need through the Columbia University predoctoral Training Program in Computational Biology. Our main goal is to train young scientists to do pioneering and high-impact research in biology using computational methods. We will accomplish this goal by providing the necessary background in both life and computational sciences and through mentored student research projects. The students will be trained to be experts in one area of computational biology (e.g. systems biology), have a good knowledge of another area (e.g. structural biology), and have an in-depth understanding of experimental biology in the area of their specialization (e.g. genetics or neuroscience). In the initial funding period - as suggested by the NIGMS training program guidelines - we focused on course and curriculum development using a small group of highly qualified trainees with diverse scientific backgrounds. Students trained by our program have already made exciting scientific breakthroughs and published high-profile articles. In this application we propose to expand the developed program to accommodate a large number of qualified students at Columbia and request 8 slots for the program. The program coursework will be tailored to students' backgrounds and interests, and will consist of a 4x2 scheme: at least 2 courses in life sciences (e.g. biochemistry, cell biology), 2 courses in quantitative subjects (e.g. machine learning, statistics), 2 courses in computational biology (e.g. computational systems biology, biophysics), and 2 electives from any of the above areas. Students will be able to earn doctoral degrees in the C2B2 Graduate Program or in the 13 affiliated departments and programs and in the laboratories of 20 training program faculty, representing both quantitative and life science disciplines. The students will also learn from rotations (including ones in experimental labs), guided independent study, an oral qualification exam, seminars, retreats, and journal clubs. The program will be directed by Dr. Barry Honig, Director of the Columbia University Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (C2B2), and crucial program decisions will be made by the program's Executive Committee. It takes on average 5 years to complete our Ph.D. program and we will typically support computational biology students for a 2-3 year period. We will make every effort to recruit and retain students who belong to minority groups, come from underprivileged backgrounds, or are disabled. We will continue to accomplish this goal by actively recruiting qualified students from these groups. All students will be required to take a 1 semester course in responsible conduct of research.

"Short-term Training Students in Health Professional Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the program is to introduce optometry students (N=8 trainees) to basic and clinical research by participating full-time for ten weeks in an apprentice/junior researcher role with an established vision scientist (N= 11 research mentors). It is expected that this experience will foster an interest in the trainee to include vision research as one critical component of their optometric career choice. In the most favorable scenario, the   trainee may wish to enter our combined O.D./M.S. or O.D./Ph.D. program in Vision Science, thus obtaining both a clinical and a research degree. Research Areas include: (1) Oculomotor system   (2) Psychophysics (3) Biochemistry/physiology. The formal disciplines of the research mentors in the above areas include optometry, physiological optics/vision science, psychology, biochemistry, and physiology. The training will be conducted in the research laboratories of the research mentors as well as those of the Schnurmacher Institute for Vision Research at the SUNY, State College of Optometry. These research areas consist of over 25,480 square feet of modern laboratory rooms and workshops. A full complement of clinical and experimental equipment is available, as well as the fully equipped   machine, wood, electronics, graphic, computer vision science shops, and extensive library facilities.   Trainees will consist of optometry students from any of the Colleges of Optometry in the USA, who have completed either their first or second professional years, and have done well academically (3.5 GPA or better). All will have an undergraduate degree, generally in the sciences. With regard to public health implications, this program will allow students to make the critical clinician/researcher interface, that is to bring in the latest scientific discoveries to the clinic. Thus, the student, and later doctor, will provide the latest and most optimal vision care for the patient.

"The q-bio Summer School     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology.

"Integrative Neuronal Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Brain and Cognitive Sciences Graduate Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests renewal of its major training grant. The department is organized to promote interdisciplinary training and research in neuroscience and behavior, approached with the experimental power of modern molecular and cellular neuroscience, systems neuroscience, and cognitive science, combined with the theoretical strength of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Trainees begin laboratory work through lab rotations in the first two terms and subsequently join a laboratory, working on problems in learning and memory, neural development, vision, motor control or brain disorders and diseases. Required course work can be completed in two to three years, with a two-term sequence of core courses in the first year, a quantitative methods course, and a flexible array of graduate lecture courses and seminar classes. The qualifying exam consists of written and oral components of an interdisciplinary NIH/NSF style grant proposal. Annual research reports and annual committee meetings are required, and mark the student's progress in research through completion of a thesis. Multiple presentations at professional meetings and journal publications are typically expected of a dissertation. Most students continue in research careers, armed with skills that typically span multiple theoretical and experimental approaches comprising molecular/cellular neuroscience, systems neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysics, behavior and computation. Trainees will, in general, have strong backgrounds in the natural sciences (e.g., undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, or electrical engineering). Occasional trainees will already hold a master's degree in another field. Candidates for the graduate program will be chosen by the department Graduate Committee constituted for the purpose of overseeing this program and will be evaluated on the basis of interviews, talent for research as demonstrated by past performance, letters of recommendation, grades, and GRE scores. Funds are requested for five years to support 12 predoctoral trainees per year.        MIT's Integrative Neuronal Systems program provides interdisciplinary training for graduate students pursuing research careers related to the understanding of the human brain and mind.

"Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The successful training program in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) has been transferred from the MIT-Harvard Division of Health Sciences and Technology to the Harvard Medical School Division of Medical Sciences (DMS). This entails incremental changes in the curriculum, because of full cross-registration and a change in focus of the clinical experience away from general physiology and towards medical genetic clinics, and clinical genetics laboratory experience. BIG continues to focus on the growing gap between the ability to generate copious amounts genomic data and the ability to systematically and efficiently make sense of all this data, particularly for clinical relevance. Ths program admits students with proven excellence in quantitative science and seeks to train competent, multi-disciplinary investigators who are capable of both integrating the genome-scale technologies into their experimental investigations, and synthesizing the resulting datasets into coherent knowledge frameworks and mathematical models for formulating and resolving fundamental questions in biology and medicine.  The BIG training program draws on three significant strengths of the local academic environment: the breadth of talented investigators at Harvard, the Medical School and affiliated hospitals, and MIT, the rich variety of quantitatively-oriented courses in advanced genomics-bioinformatics offered at Harvard and MIT, and national leadership of BIG faculty in harnessing clinical processes and electronic health records for genome-scale disease research. As a new track within DMS, the BIG pre-doctoral program provides a three legged curriculum: 1) rigorous course work in machine learning, probability theory, decision science, and biostatistics 2) in-depth courses that include the range of genome-scale measurements applied to population studies, clinical medicine and basic biology 3) survey of the larger scope of biomedical sciences as well as a rich, unique clinical experience focused on genetics clinics and genetic laboratory testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrating genomics into the practice of medicine and biomedical research is a primary goal of the National Human Genome Research Institute's strategic plan. The Harvard University Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Program meets this goal by providing students trained in the quantitative sciences the intellectual tools t integrate genomics with medical science, access to ""big data"" from healthcare systems to experiment with methods of leveraging healthcare data in genomic science, faculty who are leading efforts to integrate genome-scale results into clinical practice, and faculty who are expert in genomics and bioinformatics.

"Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bioinformatics and computational biology are two related disciplines that have developed from the need to analyze and interpret large, complex datasets which have emerged in the last decade as genomics, proteomics, systems biology, and other high-throughput approaches have become more feasible. Bioinformatics and computational biology utilize techniques from applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, and computer science to solve biological problems. The Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) was established at UNC-Chapel Hill in the Fall 2002 to address these needs. In 2007 the training program transitioned to the Ph.D. Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. The goal of the Ph.D. Curriculum is to train the next generation of scientists who can develop and apply quantitative/analytical tools to driving biological problems. The Ph.D. curriculum provides the necessary latitude to prepare students with the right balance of quantitative skills (e.g., mathematics, statistics, and computer science) and experimental approaches (e.g., genetics, cell biology, molecular biology) for making important contributions to modern biological research. There are currently 13 full professors, 8 associate professors, and 16 assistant professors among the 37 total BCB faculty. The Ph.D. curriculum consists of four key components: formal coursework, research rotations, Ph.D. research and a colloquium. The coursework is includes three tiers of training: foundational courses, core modules, and advanced courses. Eight specialized core modules have been developed that cover major areas of bioinformatics and computational biology, such as information theory, machine learning, sequence comparison, phylogeny, data management, ontology, data mining, biostatistics, biomolecular structure/function prediction, and modeling of complex systems. Funds are requested to support six predoctoral students per year. The requested funds will dovetail with the UNC investment in research infrastructure, faculty recruitment, and education in both genomics and bioinfonnatics and computational biology, leveraging intramural as well as extramural industrial support to expand this vital interdisciplinary training program. RELEVANCE: Interpreting the vast amount of data produced by high throughput biomedical technologies requires novel computational and mathematical approaches. The Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill provides the graduate training needed to develop and apply computational methods for solving driving complex biomedical problems.           n/a",Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,8691865,T32GM067553,"['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Training Programs', 'pre-doctoral']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,T32,2014,110310,0.09363171279880154
"Training Program in Computational Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational and quantitative methods are now an essential part of biological research. There is an urgent need for scientists who are expert in both computational and life sciences. We propose to continue addressing this need through the Columbia University predoctoral Training Program in Computational Biology. Our main goal is to train young scientists to do pioneering and high-impact research in biology using computational methods. We will accomplish this goal by providing the necessary background in both life and computational sciences and through mentored student research projects. The students will be trained to be experts in one area of computational biology (e.g. systems biology), have a good knowledge of another area (e.g. structural biology), and have an in-depth understanding of experimental biology in the area of their specialization (e.g. genetics or neuroscience). In the initial funding period - as suggested by the NIGMS training program guidelines - we focused on course and curriculum development using a small group of highly qualified trainees with diverse scientific backgrounds. Students trained by our program have already made exciting scientific breakthroughs and published high-profile articles. In this application we propose to expand the developed program to accommodate a large number of qualified students at Columbia and request 8 slots for the program. The program coursework will be tailored to students' backgrounds and interests, and will consist of a 4x2 scheme: at least 2 courses in life sciences (e.g. biochemistry, cell biology), 2 courses in quantitative subjects (e.g. machine learning, statistics), 2 courses in computational biology (e.g. computational systems biology, biophysics), and 2 electives from any of the above areas. Students will be able to earn doctoral degrees in the C2B2 Graduate Program or in the 13 affiliated departments and programs and in the laboratories of 20 training program faculty, representing both quantitative and life science disciplines. The students will also learn from rotations (including ones in experimental labs), guided independent study, an oral qualification exam, seminars, retreats, and journal clubs. The program will be directed by Dr. Barry Honig, Director of the Columbia University Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (C2B2), and crucial program decisions will be made by the program's Executive Committee. It takes on average 5 years to complete our Ph.D. program and we will typically support computational biology students for a 2-3 year period. We will make every effort to recruit and retain students who belong to minority groups, come from underprivileged backgrounds, or are disabled. We will continue to accomplish this goal by actively recruiting qualified students from these groups. All students will be required to take a 1 semester course in responsible conduct of research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this project to public health is in training students to use computational methods to understand genotype-to-phenotype relationships across the whole range of biological research, from genetics to protein function to cellular networks to clinical phenotypes.                        ",Training Program in Computational Biology,8688265,T32GM082797,"['Computational Biology', 'Training Programs']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,T32,2014,180536,0.1458741030594393
"Short-term Training Students in Health Professional Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the program is to introduce optometry students (N=8 trainees) to basic and clinical research by participating full-time for ten weeks in an apprentice/junior researcher role with an established vision scientist (N= 11 research mentors). It is expected that this experience will foster an interest in the trainee to include vision research as one critical component of their optometric career choice. In the most favorable scenario, the   trainee may wish to enter our combined O.D./M.S. or O.D./Ph.D. program in Vision Science, thus obtaining both a clinical and a research degree. Research Areas include: (1) Oculomotor system   (2) Psychophysics (3) Biochemistry/physiology. The formal disciplines of the research mentors in the above areas include optometry, physiological optics/vision science, psychology, biochemistry, and physiology. The training will be conducted in the research laboratories of the research mentors as well as those of the Schnurmacher Institute for Vision Research at the SUNY, State College of Optometry. These research areas consist of over 25,480 square feet of modern laboratory rooms and workshops. A full complement of clinical and experimental equipment is available, as well as the fully equipped   machine, wood, electronics, graphic, computer vision science shops, and extensive library facilities.   Trainees will consist of optometry students from any of the Colleges of Optometry in the USA, who have completed either their first or second professional years, and have done well academically (3.5 GPA or better). All will have an undergraduate degree, generally in the sciences. With regard to public health implications, this program will allow students to make the critical clinician/researcher interface, that is to bring in the latest scientific discoveries to the clinic. Thus, the student, and later doctor, will provide the latest and most optimal vision care for the patient.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   The program is intended to train optometry students in clinical research and to encourage them to seek a career involving clinical vision science and optometric research.

"The q-bio Summer School     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology.

"Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The successful training program in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) has been transferred from the MIT-Harvard Division of Health Sciences and Technology to the Harvard Medical School Division of Medical Sciences (DMS). This entails incremental changes in the curriculum, because of full cross-registration and a change in focus of the clinical experience away from general physiology and towards medical genetic clinics, and clinical genetics laboratory experience. BIG continues to focus on the growing gap between the ability to generate copious amounts genomic data and the ability to systematically and efficiently make sense of all this data, particularly for clinical relevance. Ths program admits students with proven excellence in quantitative science and seeks to train competent, multi-disciplinary investigators who are capable of both integrating the genome-scale technologies into their experimental investigations, and synthesizing the resulting datasets into coherent knowledge frameworks and mathematical models for formulating and resolving fundamental questions in biology and medicine.  The BIG training program draws on three significant strengths of the local academic environment: the breadth of talented investigators at Harvard, the Medical School and affiliated hospitals, and MIT, the rich variety of quantitatively-oriented courses in advanced genomics-bioinformatics offered at Harvard and MIT, and national leadership of BIG faculty in harnessing clinical processes and electronic health records for genome-scale disease research. As a new track within DMS, the BIG pre-doctoral program provides a three legged curriculum: 1) rigorous course work in machine learning, probability theory, decision science, and biostatistics 2) in-depth courses that include the range of genome-scale measurements applied to population studies, clinical medicine and basic biology 3) survey of the larger scope of biomedical sciences as well as a rich, unique clinical experience focused on genetics clinics and genetic laboratory testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrating genomics into the practice of medicine and biomedical research is a primary goal of the National Human Genome Research Institute's strategic plan. The Harvard University Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Program meets this goal by providing students trained in the quantitative sciences the intellectual tools t integrate genomics with medical science, access to ""big data"" from healthcare systems to experiment with methods of leveraging healthcare data in genomic science, faculty who are leading efforts to integrate genome-scale results into clinical practice, and faculty who are expert in genomics and bioinformatics.                ",Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics,8551182,T32HG002295,"['Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Training']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,T32,2013,635748,0.012457357041680514
"Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bioinformatics and computational biology are two related disciplines that have developed from the need to analyze and interpret large, complex datasets which have emerged in the last decade as genomics, proteomics, systems biology, and other high-throughput approaches have become more feasible. Bioinformatics and computational biology utilize techniques from applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, and computer science to solve biological problems. The Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) was established at UNC-Chapel Hill in the Fall 2002 to address these needs. In 2007 the training program transitioned to the Ph.D. Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. The goal of the Ph.D. Curriculum is to train the next generation of scientists who can develop and apply quantitative/analytical tools to driving biological problems. The Ph.D. curriculum provides the necessary latitude to prepare students with the right balance of quantitative skills (e.g., mathematics, statistics, and computer science) and experimental approaches (e.g., genetics, cell biology, molecular biology) for making important contributions to modern biological research. There are currently 13 full professors, 8 associate professors, and 16 assistant professors among the 37 total BCB faculty. The Ph.D. curriculum consists of four key components: formal coursework, research rotations, Ph.D. research and a colloquium. The coursework is includes three tiers of training: foundational courses, core modules, and advanced courses. Eight specialized core modules have been developed that cover major areas of bioinformatics and computational biology, such as information theory, machine learning, sequence comparison, phylogeny, data management, ontology, data mining, biostatistics, biomolecular structure/function prediction, and modeling of complex systems. Funds are requested to support six predoctoral students per year. The requested funds will dovetail with the UNC investment in research infrastructure, faculty recruitment, and education in both genomics and bioinfonnatics and computational biology, leveraging intramural as well as extramural industrial support to expand this vital interdisciplinary training program.

"Training Program in Computational Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational and quantitative methods are now an essential part of biological research. There is an urgent need for scientists who are expert in both computational and life sciences. We propose to continue addressing this need through the Columbia University predoctoral Training Program in Computational Biology. Our main goal is to train young scientists to do pioneering and high-impact research in biology using computational methods. We will accomplish this goal by providing the necessary background in both life and computational sciences and through mentored student research projects. The students will be trained to be experts in one area of computational biology (e.g. systems biology), have a good knowledge of another area (e.g. structural biology), and have an in-depth understanding of experimental biology in the area of their specialization (e.g. genetics or neuroscience). In the initial funding period - as suggested by the NIGMS training program guidelines - we focused on course and curriculum development using a small group of highly qualified trainees with diverse scientific backgrounds. Students trained by our program have already made exciting scientific breakthroughs and published high-profile articles. In this application we propose to expand the developed program to accommodate a large number of qualified students at Columbia and request 8 slots for the program. The program coursework will be tailored to students' backgrounds and interests, and will consist of a 4x2 scheme: at least 2 courses in life sciences (e.g. biochemistry, cell biology), 2 courses in quantitative subjects (e.g. machine learning, statistics), 2 courses in computational biology (e.g. computational systems biology, biophysics), and 2 electives from any of the above areas. Students will be able to earn doctoral degrees in the C2B2 Graduate Program or in the 13 affiliated departments and programs and in the laboratories of 20 training program faculty, representing both quantitative and life science disciplines. The students will also learn from rotations (including ones in experimental labs), guided independent study, an oral qualification exam, seminars, retreats, and journal clubs. The program will be directed by Dr. Barry Honig, Director of the Columbia University Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (C2B2), and crucial program decisions will be made by the program's Executive Committee. It takes on average 5 years to complete our Ph.D. program and we will typically support computational biology students for a 2-3 year period. We will make every effort to recruit and retain students who belong to minority groups, come from underprivileged backgrounds, or are disabled. We will continue to accomplish this goal by actively recruiting qualified students from these groups. All students will be required to take a 1 semester course in responsible conduct of research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this project to public health is in training students to use computational methods to understand genotype-to-phenotype relationships across the whole range of biological research, from genetics to protein function to cellular networks to clinical phenotypes.                        ",Training Program in Computational Biology,8551293,T32GM082797,"['Computational Biology', 'Training Programs']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,T32,2013,133964,0.1458741030594393
"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.  The Department of Genome Sciences of the University Of Washington School Of Medicine provides an ideal setting for training a new independent investigator with an extensive program of formal and informal education for postdoctoral scientists, opportunities for collaboration with researchers with expertise in diverse areas, and modern computational and laboratory resources. This environment maximizes the potential for the candidate to obtain the training and perform the research necessary to establish himself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program.         The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology. Additionally, the research will result in improved methodology and software resources for analyzing functional genomics data, and a better understanding of how chromatin state affects molecular biology and human disease.

"Research Education in Statistical Genetics of Substance Abuse This application seeks support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse R25 mechanism for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral research positions at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics (VIPBG) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The overall goal of this research education program is to provide an environment that encourages the development and application of statistical genetics at the highest levels. To accomplish this goal, a research education program in statistical genetics will been developed to foster interdisciplinary research, a key tenet of the NIDA mission, and which we believe is essential to conducting research in this field. Two areas of research focus are identified: Advanced Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Molecular Genetics. These areas are synergistic and address a diverse variety of statistical methods, both those in current use and those under development. The research education program consists of pre-doctoral and postdoctoral components. Pre-doctoral participants will pursue degrees in either Human and Molecular Genetics or Biostatistics. This component is designed to recruit, at the earliest time in their careers, potential future investigators to research in statistical genetics focused on substance use, abuse and dependence (SUAD). The aim is to create a cohort of PhD graduates who are have been extensively exposed to, and begun to publish research in, this area at the outset of their research training. The postdoctoral component recognizes that many promising young researchers have training in areas relevant to, but not focused on, the statistical genetics of substance use and abuse. This flexible 2-3 year postdoctoral training component will help guide young investigators to this field of study and will provide them with integrated and focused training that will enable them to pursue careers in statistical genetics of SUAD. Research education is intended for individuals with training in mathematics, statistics, biostatistics, genetics, psychology or pharmacology and to those who have completed their clinical requirements for the MD degree. The goal of the postdoctoral component is to educate independent investigators who will contribute to the efforts to identify and characterize the genetic and environmental determinants of SUAD; they are expected to do so at VCU and at other institutions nationwide. To accomplish the overall program goal we will: i) Offer and carefully monitor a multidisciplinary integrated research training program with a range of research opportunities; ii) Meet the needs for training in emerging research areas in SUAD; iii) Provide training to researchers from diverse academic and ethnic backgrounds and intensive mentoring; iv) Provide a specialized curriculum that will merge strengths in SUAD research at our institution; and v) Disseminate course materials, developed software, user guides and example scripts to the wider community by teaching workshops and establishing a website with web casts, pod casts and script libraries.

"Pittsburgh Biomedical Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The University of Pittsburgh proposes a five-year renewal of its training program in Biomedical Informatics. This program has grown significantly since its inception in 1987. It currently has 40 trainees, 12 of whom are supported by the training grant. Trainees seek academic degrees through one of two programs. The majority of students obtain degrees through the Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Training Program, which is offered through the School of Medicine. Most trainees study in the general BMI degree track. In addition, the program has concentrations in bioinformatics, dental informatics, health services research, library informatics, and public health surveillance for trainees with those special interests. Students with a special interest in artificial intelligence in medicine can obtain degrees through the Biomedical Informatics track of the Intelligent Systems Program (ISP). Both the BMI Training Program and the ISP offer M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. The BMI Training Program also offers a one-year Certificate option. Since the BMI and ISP training programs are tightly linked and coordinated through their faculty and staff, for brevity we refer to them as one program below.      Graduates of the program are finding excellent employment opportunities. The program is supported by   an interdepartmental core faculty with 30 members, all of whom are experienced educators and active   researchers. It is administered through the University's Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI), which   provides administrative support, space, and equipment for the trainees. A tightly knit leadership/ administrative group of two co-directors and three very experienced staff members supports the program director in the overall operation of the program.      We request 19 full-time funded training positions per year for the period 2007-2012, which maintains the current number of library informatics trainees at two, maintains the number of dental informatics trainees also at two, and increases the number of ""uncategorical"" positions from 11 to 15.

"Pittsburgh Biomedical Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The University of Pittsburgh proposes a five-year renewal of its training program in Biomedical Informatics. This program has grown significantly since its inception in 1987. It currently has 40 trainees, 12 of whom are supported by the training grant. Trainees seek academic degrees through one of two programs. The majority of students obtain degrees through the Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Training Program, which is offered through the School of Medicine. Most trainees study in the general BMI degree track. In addition, the program has concentrations in bioinformatics, dental informatics, health services research, library informatics, and public health surveillance for trainees with those special interests. Students with a special interest in artificial intelligence in medicine can obtain degrees through the Biomedical Informatics track of the Intelligent Systems Program (ISP). Both the BMI Training Program and the ISP offer M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. The BMI Training Program also offers a one-year Certificate option. Since the BMI and ISP training programs are tightly linked and coordinated through their faculty and staff, for brevity we refer to them as one program below.      Graduates of the program are finding excellent employment opportunities. The program is supported by   an interdepartmental core faculty with 30 members, all of whom are experienced educators and active   researchers. It is administered through the University's Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI), which   provides administrative support, space, and equipment for the trainees.

"Short-term Training Students in Health Professional Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the program is to introduce optometry students (N=8 trainees) to basic and clinical research by participating full-time for ten weeks in an apprentice/junior researcher role with an established vision scientist (N= 11 research mentors). It is expected that this experience will foster an interest in the trainee to include vision research as one critical component of their optometric career choice. In the most favorable scenario, the   trainee may wish to enter our combined O.D./M.S. or O.D./Ph.D. program in Vision Science, thus obtaining both a clinical and a research degree.

The formal disciplines of the research mentors in the above areas include optometry, physiological optics/vision science, psychology, biochemistry, and physiology. The training will be conducted in the research laboratories of the research mentors as well as those of the Schnurmacher Institute for Vision Research at the SUNY, State College of Optometry. These research areas consist of over 25,480 square feet of modern laboratory rooms and workshops. A full complement of clinical and experimental equipment is available, as well as the fully equipped   machine, wood, electronics, graphic, computer vision science shops, and extensive library facilities.   Trainees will consist of optometry students from any of the Colleges of Optometry in the USA, who have completed either their first or second professional years, and have done well academically (3.5 GPA or better).

"Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bioinformatics and computational biology are two related disciplines that have developed from the need to analyze and interpret large, complex datasets which have emerged in the last decade as genomics, proteomics, systems biology, and other high-throughput approaches have become more feasible. Bioinformatics and computational biology utilize techniques from applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, and computer science to solve biological problems. The Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) was established at UNC-Chapel Hill in the Fall 2002 to address these needs. In 2007 the training program transitioned to the Ph.D. Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. The goal of the Ph.D. Curriculum is to train the next generation of scientists who can develop and apply quantitative/analytical tools to driving biological problems. The Ph.D. curriculum provides the necessary latitude to prepare students with the right balance of quantitative skills (e.g., mathematics, statistics, and computer science) and experimental approaches (e.g., genetics, cell biology, molecular biology) for making important contributions to modern biological research. There are currently 13 full professors, 8 associate professors, and 16 assistant professors among the 37 total BCB faculty. The Ph.D. curriculum consists of four key components: formal coursework, research rotations, Ph.D. research and a colloquium. The coursework is includes three tiers of training: foundational courses, core modules, and advanced courses. Eight specialized core modules have been developed that cover major areas of bioinformatics and computational biology, such as information theory, machine learning, sequence comparison, phylogeny, data management, ontology, data mining, biostatistics, biomolecular structure/function prediction, and modeling of complex systems. Funds are requested to support six predoctoral students per year. The requested funds will dovetail with the UNC investment in research infrastructure, faculty recruitment, and education in both genomics and bioinfonnatics and computational biology, leveraging intramural as well as extramural industrial support to expand this vital interdisciplinary training program.

"Training in Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Columbia University proposes to continue its NLM-supported training program in biomedical informatics, initiated in 1992, expanded in 1997, and renewed in 2002. Our goal is to help to shape the evolving discipline of biomedical informatics by defining a rigorous, academically-oriented training program that offers complementary exposures to real-world systems, both in clinical settings here at CUMC/NYPH and in the biological sciences through the Columbia Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Our training program seeks to further the development of the field, and the quality of future research, by demonstrating to its students, and to the biomedical community, that biomedical informatics addresses fundamental issues of biomedical knowledge and information, their representation, and their biomedical application. We have accordingly developed and evolved a curriculum that assures that our graduates will be familiar with a broad range of pertinent topics in the field. Each trainee then selects an area of subspecialization within the field, with the established tracks being clinical informatics, public health informatics, imaging informatics, or bioinformatics. Our degrees generally require a minimum of two years for the MA and four years for the Ph.D., although most students take somewhat.      We are proposing to enroll 10 NLM-suported predoctoral trainees and 8 NLM-supported postdoctoral trainees per year (with 1 additional predoc and 2 additional postdocs in Years 1 and 2 due to a supplement we have already received for Public Health Informatics training). We expect over 50 graduate students and post-doctoral trainees in our entire (NLM and non-NLM) program in September 2006. Among our 103 graduates since approval of our degree program, we have graduated 16 PhD students, 7 of whom were NLM-supported. We have had 87 graduates of our masters program, 27 of whom were NLM-supported post-doctoral trainees. Eleven non-degree NLM postdoctoral trainees have also completed training with us since 1994.       We have a large, internationally recognized faculty with consistent involvement in national biomedical informatics projects. Education for our trainees involves one-on-one experience with faculty members, working on research projects that in many cases are conceived by the students themselves.

"Pittsburgh Biomedical Informatics Training Program The University of Pittsburgh proposes a five-year renewal of its training program in Biomedical Informatics. This program has grown significantly since its inception in 1987. It currently has 40 trainees, 12 of whom are supported by the training grant. Trainees seek academic degrees through one of two programs. The majority of students obtain degrees through the Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Training Program, which is offered through the School of Medicine. Most trainees study in the general BMI degree track. In addition, the program has concentrations in bioinformatics, dental informatics, health services research, library informatics, and public health surveillance for trainees with those special interests. Students with a special interest in artificial intelligence in medicine can obtain degrees through the Biomedical Informatics track of the Intelligent Systems Program (ISP). Both the BMI Training Program and the ISP offer M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. The BMI Training Program also offers a one-year Certificate option. Since the BMI and ISP training programs are tightly linked and coordinated through their faculty and staff, for brevity we refer to them as one program below.  Graduates of the program are finding excellent employment opportunities. The program is supported by an interdepartmental core faculty with 30 members, all of whom are experienced educators and active researchers. It is administered through the University's Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI), which provides administrative support, space, and equipment for the trainees. A tightly knit leadership/administrative group of two co-directors and three very experienced staff members supports the program director in the overall operation of the program.

"UNC Predoc Training Progr in Bioinformatics/Comp Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies call for a new generation of scientists equipped to extract knowledge from large biological datasets and develop and apply novel data analytical, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques. The Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) was established at UNC-Chapel Hill in the Fall 2002 to address these needs. The Program is administered by the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences (CCGS), which was formed in August 2001 with a mission of conducting basic and applied research in all areas related to genome sciences. Twelve BCB faculty members have been recruited by UNC-CH in the last two years, with specialties in evolutionary genetics, information science, proteome analysis, protein folding, statistical genetics, and mathematical biology. In total, 39 computational and experimental genomics faculty distributed among 16 departments and schools are affiliated as BCB mentors. The program consists of four key components: a colloquium, research rotations, formal coursework, and PhD research. The coursework is designed to include three tiers of formal training: prerequisite, core, and advanced courses. Eight specialized core modules have been developed for the BCB program that cover major related areas such as information theory, machine learning, sequence comparison, phylogeny, data management, ontology, data mining, biostatistics, biomolecular structure/function prediction, and modeling of complex systems. Funds are requested to support six predoctoral students for two years each. Matching support from several local industrial organizations has been committed to allow additional student support and/or industrial internships. The students will pursue PhD degrees in participating UNC-CH Departments with a common emphasis on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; future plans include transitioning into independent Phi3 granting curriculum. The requested funds will dovetail with the UNC investment in research infrastructure, faculty recruitment, and education in both genomics and bioinformatics, leveraging intramural as well as extramural industrial support to expand this vital interdisciplinary training program. n/a",UNC Predoc Training Progr in Bioinformatics/Comp Biology,7648121,T32GM067553,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Training', 'pre-doctoral']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,T32,2009,162497,0.11580165954931625

"Multimodal Neuroimaging Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to enable the development of novel interdisciplinary training programs that integrate two components 1) an NRSA predoctoral training program and 2) a Short-Term Research Education Program, which will include a non-NRSA predoctoral training program. There have been great advances in in vivo imaging techniques, which allow neuroscientists to visualize molecular, cellular, and system physiology and functions. To fully utilize neuroimaging techniques, it is important to understand underlying principles, data detection, and data modeling and visualization. Furthermore, each technique has its own strengths and limitations. In order to overcome the weakness of one neuroimaging modality, it is absolutely essential to utilize complementary imaging modalities. Often, researchers may not utilize advanced neuroimaging technologies due to the lack of proper training in these methodologies, therefore, it is crucial to train students the principles and limitations of multiple neuroimaging modalities. In order to achieve this goal, we propose to create the Multimodal Neuroimaging Training Program (T90/R90) for predoctoral and short-term summer students, which will be jointly run by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. This program will be administered by the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which seamlessly spans both institutes and is a coordinated interdisciplinary research and educational Center of international stature. Specific aims of the predoctoral training program are to 1) teach basic neuroscience for integrative neuroimaging research; 2) to teach underlying principles, modeling, and applications of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, positron emission tomography, magnetoencephalography, and optical imaging from animals to humans; and 3) to integrate multiple methods and carry out multimodal neuroimaging projects. To achieve the specific aims, trainees will take core courses and laboratory rotations, seminars and participate in an annual retreat. In addition to the graduate T90/R90 training program, the short-term Multimodal Neuroimaging Summer School (R90) is proposed to teach the synergy of multi-modal neuroimaging for targeted students and investigators who have experience in one imaging modality and want to expand their training to other modalities. The summer program will consist of basic lectures, hand-on laboratory workshop, and performing projects, emphasizing the methodologies of multiple imaging modalities. Our proposed program will train researchers for adequate handling of the increasing complexity of combining multimodal neuroimaging data with the knowledge of various data acquisition and processing approaches, and appropriate interpretations. This will speed up the synergetic application of multiple imaging modalities to basic and clinical neuroscience research in animals and humans. All training faculty have an exceptional track record of effective interdisciplinary training and cooperative research. The materials developed in this Training Program will be distributed through the web.          n/a",Multimodal Neuroimaging Training Program,7674750,T90DA022761,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cellular biology', 'Cerebellum', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Fourier Transform', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Neurobiology', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Center for Research Resources', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Evaluation', 'Protein Chemistry', 'Psychology', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Student Selections', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Visit', 'Visual system structure', 'Voting', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain metabolism', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'design', 'electrical property', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interest', 'international center', 'lectures', 'ligand gated channel', 'meetings', 'member', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'physical science', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'receptor function', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensorimotor system', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'voltage', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,T90,2009,77353,0.11249022823563547

"Pittsburgh Biomedical Informatics Training Program The University of Pittsburgh proposes a five-year renewal of its training program in Biomedical Informatics. This program has grown significantly since its inception in 1987. It currently has 40 trainees, 12 of whom are supported by the training grant. Trainees seek academic degrees through one of two programs. The majority of students obtain degrees through the Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Training Program, which is offered through the School of Medicine. Most trainees study in the general BMI degree track. In addition, the program has concentrations in bioinformatics, dental informatics, health services research, library informatics, and public health surveillance for trainees with those special interests. Students with a special interest in artificial intelligence in medicine can obtain degrees through the Biomedical Informatics track of the Intelligent Systems Program (ISP). Both the BMI Training Program and the ISP offer M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. The BMI Training Program also offers a one-year Certificate option. Since the BMI and ISP training programs are tightly linked and coordinated through their faculty and staff, for brevity we refer to them as one program below.  Graduates of the program are finding excellent employment opportunities. The program is supported by an interdepartmental core faculty with 30 members, all of whom are experienced educators and active researchers. It is administered through the University's Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI), which provides administrative support, space, and equipment for the trainees.

"Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to PAR-03-034 ""Neuroinformatics Institutional Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K12)."" The overarching goal of this application is to provide an excellent postdoctoral training program in neuroimaging neuroinformatics that capitalizes on the many strengths of the existing neuroscientists, informatics and imaging resources that our combined resources represent. Our proposed Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program (NNTP) is based upon a number of important strategic alliances. The first cornerstone of this effort is the existing HBP grants held by Dr. Anders Dale (R01 NS39581: Cortical-Surface-Based Brain Imaging) and Dr. David Kennedy (R01 NS34189: Anatomic Morphologic Analysis of MR Brain Images). These efforts span a wealth of technological developments, research and clinical application areas in the rapidly developing area of quantitative morphometric image analysis. A second and vital cornerstone is our association with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Biomedical Informatics Program. This existing pre- and post-graduate academic program, within a world class biomedical engineering department, is an ideal setting for the development of a coordinated training effort in Neuroinformatics. The established track record in training skilled scientists in areas of informatics will prove invaluable in this new initiative. The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees. A plan for recruiting, selecting and monitoring trainees is proposed. This program will be an asset to the Neuroinformatics initiatives of the Human Brain Project by helping to prepare future scientists with advanced neuroinformatics skills         n/a",Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program,7371085,K12MH069281,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Informatics Research Network', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Activities', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Program Development', 'Psyche structure', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SECTM1 gene', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Woman', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'brain morphology', 'career', 'cationic antimicrobial protein CAP 37', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'imaging informatics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K12,2008,462488,0.12284290817640765
"MIT EECS/Whitehead/Broad Training Program in Computational Biology(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   We propose to establish a new interdisciplinary research training program in Computational Biology as a collaborative effort between MIT, the Whitehead Institute, and the Broad Institute. The goal of this program is to train computer science students to be effective interdisciplinary scientists, working as team members with biologists to develop new algorithms, tools, and approaches for analyzing experimental biological data and expressing this analysis in the form of principled predictive models. The program faculty will consist of five MIT EECS faculty in Computer Science, four MIT/Whitehead faculty members in Biology, and the head the MIT Broad Institute. The major research disciplines of this program include: the development of new approaches and algorithms for the analysis of data from biological experiments, approaches for the principled design of biological experiments based upon past data, the construction of computational models that explain complex biological phenomenon, and the development of approaches for interpreting clinical data relevant to human health and disease.    It is proposed that four pre-doctoral trainees be supported in this program. We have been running an informal training program in this area for over three years, and our students to date have made substantial contributions to the field. Among our recent graduates are faculty at Stanford, Princeton, Duke, and CMU. Our pool of applicants is unusually strong, with 574 applicants in 2004 in the relevant sub-area of computer science.   Trainees in our proposed research training program will have a very rigorous technical and quantitative foundation from the MIT graduate program in Computer Science, combined formal interdisciplinary course work and a co mentorship arrangement between a Computer Science and a Biology faculty member. The strong technical skills present in our pre-doctoral students have provided an excellent foundation for the creation of ground breaking new approaches and algorithms in computational biology. In addition, we have run off-site interdisciplinary summer retreats for the past three years that have been very effective at catalyzing productive pre-doctoral research. n/a",MIT EECS/Whitehead/Broad Training Program in Computational Biology(RMI),7483074,T90DK070069,"['Algorithms', 'Appendix', 'Applied Research', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Budgets', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular biology', 'Class', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Security', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Digital Computers', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drops', 'Educational Status', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Master of Science', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Minor', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Oral', 'Oral Examination', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Professional counselor', 'Programming Languages', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Range', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Running', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure/Function Nuclei', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Volition', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'combinatorial', 'computer network', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cryptography', 'day', 'design', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'parallel processing', 'pre-doctoral', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'residence', 'response', 'scientific computing', 'skills', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'symposium', 'systems research', 'theories', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,T90,2008,136349,0.12820195797360107
"Training in Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University Columbia University proposes to continue its NLM-supported training program in biomedical informatics, initiated in 1992, expanded in 1997, and renewed in 2002. Our goal is to help to shape the evolving discipline of biomedical informatics by defining a rigorous, academically-oriented training program that offers complementary exposures to real-world systems, both in clinical settings here at CUMC/NYPH and in the biological sciences through the Columbia Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Our training program seeks to further the development of the field, and the quality of future research, by demonstrating to its students, and to the biomedical community, that biomedical informatics addresses fundamental issues of biomedical knowledge and information, their representation, and their biomedical application. We have accordingly developed and evolved a curriculum that assures that our graduates will be familiar with a broad range of pertinent topics in the field. Each trainee then selects an area of subspecialization within the field, with the established tracks being clinical informatics, public health informatics, imaging informatics, or bioinformatics. Our degrees generally require a minimum of two years for the MA and four years for the Ph.D, although most students take somewhat longer. We are proposing to enroll 10 NLM-suported predoctoral trainees and 8 NLM-supported postdoctoral trainees per year (with 1 additional predoc and 2 additional postdocs in Years 1 and 2 due to a supplement we have already received for Public Health Informatics training). We expect over 50 graduate students and post-doctoral trainees in our entire (NLM and non-NLM) program in September 2006. Among our 103 graduates since approval of our degree program, we have graduated 16 PhD students, 7 of whom were NLM-supported. We have had 87 graduates of our masters program, 27 of whom were NLM-supported post-doctoral trainees. Eleven non-degree NLM postdoctoral trainees have also completed training with us since 1994. We have a large, internationally recognized faculty with consistent involvement in national biomedical informatics projects. Education for our trainees involves one-on-one experience with faculty members, working on research projects that in many cases are conceived by the students themselves. Almost all trainees are formal degree candidates and take coursework from within the Department and from the excellent resources available at Columbia University. The faculty, research staff, and students form a critical mass for providing a provocative environment for the seminars, journal clubs, and discussions. Our clinical information systems service responsibilities offer trainees opportunities to get first-hand exposure to, and training on, state-of-the-art clinical, educational, administrative, and research information systems. n/a",Training in Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University,7587191,T15LM007079,"['Accountability', 'Acculturation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Authorization documentation', 'Back', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Dental Schools', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Directories', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Educational Status', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Information System', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'New York', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Oral', 'Oral Examination', 'Organ', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Philosophical Overviews', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preceptorship', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Proceedings and Conferences', 'Proceedings, Conference', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Published Directory', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Social Sciences', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stimulus', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcript', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Week', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'experience', 'field survey', 'health application', 'imaging informatics', 'informatics training', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lectures', 'literature survey', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'portability', 'post-doctoral training', 'posters', 'practical application', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'software development', 'theories']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,T15,2008,193231,0.19090177061222835

Our training program seeks to further the development of the field, and the quality of future research, by demonstrating to its students, and to the biomedical community, that biomedical informatics addresses fundamental issues of biomedical knowledge and information, their representation, and their biomedical application. We have accordingly developed and evolved a curriculum that assures that our graduates will be familiar with a broad range of pertinent topics in the field. Each trainee then selects an area of subspecialization within the field, with the established tracks being clinical informatics, public health informatics, imaging informatics, or bioinformatics. Our degrees generally require a minimum of two years for the MA and four years for the Ph.D., although most students take somewhat.      We are proposing to enroll 10 NLM-suported predoctoral trainees and 8 NLM-supported postdoctoral trainees per year (with 1 additional predoc and 2 additional postdocs in Years 1 and 2 due to a supplement we have already received for Public Health Informatics training). We expect over 50 graduate students and post-doctoral trainees in our entire (NLM and non-NLM) program in September 2006. Among our 103 graduates since approval of our degree program, we have graduated 16 PhD students, 7 of whom were NLM-supported. We have had 87 graduates of our masters program, 27 of whom were NLM-supported post-doctoral trainees. Eleven non-degree NLM postdoctoral trainees have also completed training with us since 1994.       We have a large, internationally recognized faculty with consistent involvement in national biomedical informatics projects. Education for our trainees involves one-on-one experience with faculty members, working on research projects that in many cases are conceived by the students themselves. Almost all trainees are formal degree candidates and take coursework from within the Department and from the excellent resources available at Columbia University. The faculty, research staff, and students form a critical mass for providing a provocative environment for the seminars, journal clubs, and discussions. Our clinical information systems service responsibilities offer trainees opportunities to get first-hand exposure to, and training on, state-of-the-art clinical, educational, administrative, and research information systems.                   n/a",Training in Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University,7470106,T15LM007079,"['Accountability', 'Acculturation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Authorization documentation', 'Back', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Dental Schools', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Directories', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Educational Status', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Information System', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'New York', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Oral', 'Oral Examination', 'Organ', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Philosophical Overviews', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preceptorship', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Proceedings and Conferences', 'Proceedings, Conference', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Published Directory', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Social Sciences', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stimulus', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcript', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Week', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'experience', 'field survey', 'health application', 'imaging informatics', 'informatics training', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lectures', 'literature survey', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'portability', 'post-doctoral training', 'posters', 'practical application', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'software development', 'theories']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,T15,2008,1213873,0.19083450128057244
"Graduate Training in Biomedical Informatics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The Stanford Biomedical Informatics (BMI) training program continues to offer MS and PhD degrees to   students with an intensive training that prepares them for careers in research. The formal core curriculum trains them in a five part curriculum that features (1) core biomedical informatics, (2) domain biology or medicine (3) computer science, (4) probability and statistics, and (5) ethical, legal, and social issues. The curriculum offers general training in biomedical informatics, appropriate for students whose research subsequently focuses on diverse application areas within biomedicine. The program has particular strength in bioinformatics and clinical translational research. However, Stanford's research milieu provides excellent opportunities for basic informatics research in other areas as well. We are in the 22nd year as an NLM supported training program, with a steady state of about 32 total students. We have produced 102 graduates, 55 of whom were NLM-supported at some period. In this proposal, we request continuing support for the training of fourteen pre-doctoral and four post-doctoral candidates per year, representing a small shift in balance in response to our applicant pool. Most training slots will be used for BMI degree candidates, although we will take advantage of program flexibility to fund a small number of post-MD or Ph.D. candidates who are not BMI degree candidates. We are currently receiving more than 80 applications for 4-8 total spots in our program (a subset of which are NLM supported). We propose to continue our successful training program in the next five years, with an expanded executive committee, increased recruitment of participating faculty, a consulting service to allow students to have direct contact with biomedical researchers, and a continuing plan for increased affirmative action recruitment of women and minority students. The BMI program will therefore continue to produce leaders in academic and industrial biomedical informatics, and will continue to respond to the changing landscape of biomedical research in the information age.             n/a",Graduate Training in Biomedical Informatics,7457660,T15LM007033,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Advertising', 'Age', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Aptitude', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arizona', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Baltimore', 'Baptist Church', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'British', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Chicago', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Skills', 'Collaborations', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conflict of Interest', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Credentialing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Analysis', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dill', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distance Learning', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genomics', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hong Kong', 'Hour', 'Humanities', 'Indium', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Interview', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Laws', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Legal', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Missouri', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Newsletter', 'Notification', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Oral', 'Oral Examination', 'Oral cavity', 'Palate', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placement', 'Pliability', 'Policies', 'Polishes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prize', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Proceedings and Conferences', 'Proceedings, Conference', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Range', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Request for Applications', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Review Literature', 'Rotation', 'Rural', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Services', 'Singapore', 'Site', 'Social Policies', 'Societies', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taiwan', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tokyo', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'Washington', 'Week', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'college', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'day', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'experience', 'foot', 'informatics training', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'model design', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'protein structure prediction', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'wiki']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,T15,2008,967500,0.17032029621839243
"Integrative Neuronal Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests renewal of its major training grant. The department is organized to promote interdisciplinary graduate training and research in neuroscience and behavior, approached with the experimental power of modern cellular and molecular neuroscience, systems neuroscience and cognitive science, combined with the theoretical strength of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Trainees begin laboratory work under one or more advisors through lab rotations in the first term and subsequently join a laboratory, working on problems in learning and memory, neural development, vision, or motor control. Required coursework can be completed in two to three years, with a two-term sequence of core courses in the first year and a flexible array of graduate lecture courses, seminars, and guided reading. Oral and written reports to the faculty and at professional meetings and in journals mark the students' progress through completion of a thesis which is usually based on the second major project, begun by the third year. Most students continue in research careers, armed with skills that typically span multiple disciplines across cellular and molecular neuroscience, systems neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, neuropsychology, psychophysics, and computation.       Trainees will, in general, have strong backgrounds in the natural sciences (e.g., undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics or electrical engineering). Occasional trainees will already hold a master's degree in another field. Candidates for the graduate program will be chosen by the department Graduate Committee constituted for the purpose of overseeing this program and will be evaluated on the basis of interviews, talent for research as demonstrated by past performance, letters of recommendation, grades, and GRE scores.       Funds are requested for 5 years to support 12 trainees per year.          n/a",Integrative Neuronal Systems,7456586,T32GM007484,"['Neurons', 'System']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,T32,2008,476231,0.13571833128685898
"Training in Biomedical Discovery from Large Scale Data Sets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of genomics, proteomics and advanced imaging technology has resulted in the accumulation of vast amounts of biological data. As large scale data sets become predominant in biomedical research, we are approaching a paradigm shift in which the process of discovery is data-driven, and in which data are the source of hypotheses as well as the means for testing them. These masses of data are rich sources of information; however, extracting meaningful information can be a daunting challenge, and often presents a bottleneck for the discovery process. Thus, there is a pressing need for interdisciplinary training of scientists who understand the data, how they are generated, and what they are used for. In addition, these scientists must become developers and highly skilled users of the new computational tools necessary to analyze large data sets. The goal of this program is to train students to become proficient in the following areas: 1. Data acquisition. This will include knowledge of the methods of genomics, proteomics and imaging. 2. Computation. This will include knowledge of mathematical and statistical algorithms, implementation of effective computer codes as well as an emphasis on methods of data warehousing in relational, deductive and other databases. 3. Data integration. This is a critical area that involves extracting useful information from the heterogeneous data sets at various spatial and temporal scales. It will include knowledge of methods of modeling and simulation of systems from the molecular to the organism level. There will also be an emphasis on computational data mining methods. The core of the program will be research-based training in interdisciplinary teams under the guidance of at least two mentors from disparate disciplines (i.e., computational/mathematical and biomedical sciences). Training activities will consist of specialized didactic coursework as well as seminars, journal clubs and a student-faculty retreat. This will be a cross-institutional training program with faculty drawn from departments ranging from computer science and statistics to genetics and medicine, in five participating institutions in the Gulf Coast Consortia in the Houston Area. The training of scientists equipped to manage and extract information from large data sets will greatly facilitate biological discovery in areas such as infectious disease and cancer and therefore this training program will have a direct, positive impact on public health.           n/a",Training in Biomedical Discovery from Large Scale Data Sets,7492915,T90DA022885,"['Advertising', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Annual Reports', 'Apoptosis', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Biotechnology', 'Case Study', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Members', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Counseling', 'Country', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Documentation', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Status', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Figs -

"Medical Imaging Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The objective of this grant is to support training of the upcoming generation of scientists in medical imaging informatics. The next significant challenge in biomedical informatics will be to support new knowledge discovery: thus, the application domain of this training program will be on informatics in support of clinical and translational research. In addition to existing informatics research, fundamental theories and developments from a spectrum of disciplines (computer science, applied math, statistics, medicine) will be required to facilitate such informatics research, and must be integrated into a forward-looking training program. This program further focuses on imaging informatics: with the now ubiquitous usage of imaging as an in vivo method for objectively documenting and understanding human disease, new and unique research challenges arise in the acquisition, the understanding, and the usage of such data towards creating novel insights.      Evolving from the current UCLA NLM training grant in imaging-based medical informatics, doctoral (PhD) and postdoctoral training are offered through an approved degree-granting track in medical imaging informatics in the UCLA Biomedical Engineering Interdepartmental Program. The program consists of a comprehensive one year core curriculum that provides a breadth of understanding in biomedical informatics (medical data standards and information architectures; knowledge representation; medical decision making; information extraction/ retrieval; bioinformatics) and the underlying principles of medical image acquisition, standardization, and content understanding. Further specialization is achieved through subsequent elective courses that provide expertise in a given informatics area. Importantly, the program stresses informatics research and its subsequent   application, requiring trainees to conduct novel and innovative investigations as part of the course of   study. Core faculty are drawn from an interdisciplinary group of researchers in the UCLA Schools of Medicine, Engineering, Letters & Sciences, and Information Studies. This program will be able to leverage the wide array of biomedical and informatics endeavors from its core faculty and across the UCLA campus to provide students with numerous opportunities for research. Additionally, this training program will support short-term summer training for undergraduate students to encourage interest in biomedical and imaging informatics graduate work.             n/a",Medical Imaging Informatics Training Program,7457668,T15LM007356,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Academic Training', 'Accent', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advertising', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Aptitude', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Body of uterus', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Calculi', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Cations', 'Causations', 'Chemistry', 'Chest', 'Childhood', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer information processing', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Creativeness', 'Cytogenetics', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Decision Theory', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Digital Libraries', 'Directories', 'Discipline', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Distributed Databases', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Ecology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Figs -

"Vanderbilt Biomedical Informatics Training Program Vanderbilt University proposes a five-year renewal of its Biomedical Informatics Training Program. Begun in 2001, the program offers MS and PhD degrees in Biomedical Informatics, as well as nondegree postdoctoral and short-term training experiences. The program has experienced steady growth in high quality applicants and currently has more than 20 trainees, including 16 predoctoral and postdoctoral students funded by our NLM training grant, now in its fourth year. The Training Program's administrative home, the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI), has likewise grown - infaculty, resources, andproductivity - to become widely regarded as among the top informatics programs nationally. The informatics-rich environments of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System provide provide ""hands on"" training experiences that are exemplary. The MS and PhD degree programs include a core curriculum of courses in biomedical informatics and the foundation disciplines of computer science, biomedicine, and research methodology. Degree-seeking students pursue concentrated study in one of several application domains, including clinical informatics and bioinformatics, and the emerging areas of clinical research and translational informatics and organizational informatics now under development. We continue to offer research-intensive nondegree postdoctoral fellowships. For the period 2007-2012, Vanderbilt requests a total of 16 full-time training positions (10 predoctoral and 6 postdoctoral) and 4 short- term training positions per year. Through the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance, we will continue to recruit Meharry students, graduates, and residents who seek training in biomedical informatics and expand recruitment efforts to underrepresented minorities from other institutions. Since its inception in 1991, the Vanderbilt Biomedical Informatics initiative has had one, key unifying idea: the best research and the best innovation arise from a deep understanding of the problems being addressed, and a commitment to creating tools and systems that serve real-world needs. Application and evaluation of these informatics innovations results in scalable tools that address today's most urgent challenges in healthcare delivery, biomedical research, and health professions education. Vanderbilt biomedical informatics graduates will become the next generation of scholars and innovators, leading the charge against these and other challenges not yet imagined. n/a",Vanderbilt

"Vanderbilt Biomedical Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Vanderbilt University proposes a five-year renewal of its Biomedical Informatics Training Program. Begun in 2001, the program offers MS and PhD degrees in Biomedical Informatics, as well as nondegree postdoctoral and short-term training experiences. The program has experienced steady growth in high quality applicants and currently has more than 20 trainees, including 16 predoctoral and postdoctoral students funded by our NLM training grant, now in its fourth year. The Training Program's administrative home, the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI), has likewise grown - in faculty, resources, and productivity - to become widely regarded as among the top informatics programs nationally. The informatics-rich environments of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System provide ""hands on"" training experiences that are exemplary. The MS and PhD degree programs include a core curriculum of courses in biomedical informatics and the foundation disciplines of computer science, biomedicine, and research methodology. Degree-seeking students pursue concentrated study in one of several application domains, including clinical informatics and bioinformatics, and the emerging areas of clinical research and translational informatics and organizational informatics now under development. We continue to offer research-intensive nondegree postdoctoral fellowships. For the period 2007-2012, Vanderbilt requests a total of 16 full-time training positions (10 predoctoral and 6 postdoctoral) and 4 shortterm   training positions per year. Through the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance, we will continue to recruit Meharry   students, graduates, and residents who seek training in biomedical informatics and expand recruitment   efforts to underrepresented minorities from other institutions. Since its inception in 1991, the Vanderbilt   Biomedical Informatics initiative has had one, key unifying idea: the best research and the best innovation arise from a deep understanding of the problems being addressed, and a commitment to creating tools and systems that serve real-world needs. Application and evaluation of these informatics innovations results in scalable tools that address today's most urgent challenges in healthcare delivery, biomedical research, and health professions education. Vanderbilt biomedical informatics graduates will become the next generation of scholars and innovators, leading the charge against these and other challenges not yet imagined.

Founded in 1992, the OHSU program has been an innovator and leader in the field, and we this proposal as further advances our contributions to developing the academic discipline of biomedical informatics. The main goal of the OHSU fellowship program in biomedical informatics is to train future researchers and leaders in the field. These are exciting as well as changing times for the discipline. The value of information technology (IT) in all aspects of biomedicine has been recognized by the larger biomedical community. At OHSU and other leading institutions in the field, this has been rewarded through designation of departmental or related status as well as promotion of faculty based on their accomplishments in the discipline. The core competency of graduates from the OHSU NLM fellowship program is to use informatics theory and applications to conduct health and biomedical research. The primary purpose of this research should be to improve human health as well as develop preventive and therapeutic interventions for human disease. In addition, graduates should be able to make scientific contributions to fields related to informatics, including but not limited to medicine, nursing, public health, other health professions, computer science, library and information science, cognitive science, and organizational and management science. We also expect that our graduates will become leaders in the other facets of the field, such as education, thought leadership, and/or administration. In this next cycle of funding, we propose to enhance the program by demarcating a more explicit separation of training for research and applied informatics, establishing separate tracks for medical informatics and bioinformatics, and expanding its capacity.

"Research Training in Health Protection and Preparedness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Profound and ongoing advances in biomedical science are not being translated effectively into improvements in the overall health of the American public. Though many programs train basic and clinical research scientists, training in research at the interface of medicine and public health is scarce. Addressing this deficiency is vital to the public health. The goal of the New York University School of Medicine proposal is to solidify and evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative new program to train post-doctoral, physician fellows in health protection and preparedness research and create sustainable research linkages between academic institutions and front-line public health agencies. After a rigorous and focused curriculum in core public health disciplines and research methods, fellows work with one of a cadre of outstanding mentors investigating real-world challenges at the interface of medicine and public health. Organizational partners include the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and the New York University Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and Response, allowing for a broad diversity in exposure to health protection and preparedness research as well as bidirectional transfer of experience and expertise. The initial cohort of six fellows (from three disciplines), now mid-way through this two year Master's in Science degree granting program, is engaged in diverse research initiatives on topics from colorectal cancer screening among immigrants to health literacy interventions to improve care of pediatric patients in emergency departments to exploring the power of natural language processing for medical record-based detection of medical errors, with implications for syndromic surveillance. The Division of General Internal Medicine at New York University School of Medicine is committed to developing a Center for Population Health Research and Training that can meaningfully contribute to building the Nation's supply of physician public health researchers.             n/a",Research Training in Health Protection and Preparedness,7496009,T01CD000146,[' '],ODCDC,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,T01,2008,1254293,0.04676030246103848
"Doctoral Training in Bioinformatics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomics is revolutionizing research in evolution, developmental biology and, more generally, in the molecular biology of the cell in normal and pathological states. It promises to revolutionize medicine by the development of new diagnostics based on molecular fingerprints, the identification of drug targets, and individualized medicine. The revolution rests on high throughput experimental methods, closely associated high throughput computational methods--machine learning algorithms, mathematical statistics and the like---and modem information technologies that permit easy many to many communication between thousands of users. Our Ph.D. Program in Bioinformatics is currently directed at training two different groups: researchers who will become professionals in the field; i.e. who will move it forward by the development of new methods required for creative experimental research; and biomedical researchers who will be users of the technologies. Because computation and experiment are tightly coupled, all students in the Program must have hands on experience at the bench in addition to intensive training in computational methods. In recognition of the profound effect these technologies are likely to have on the social fabric, all students are required to take a core, full-credit course on legal and ethical implications of genomics.             n/a",Doctoral Training in Bioinformatics,7449727,T32GM070409,"['Bioinformatics', 'Training']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),T32,2008,172019,0.06192845560799187
"Interdisciplinary Training in Computational Neuroscience    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroscience increasingly requires the integration of sophisticated experimental and quantitative approaches. The development of increasingly sophisticated models and the analysis of massive sources of data routinely push neuroscientists to the limits of their quantitative and analytical abilities. In this way, computational neuroscience has become an element of the mainstream of neuroscience research. However, few training programs have adapted to this increase in the importance of quantitative approaches in neuroscience, leaving many students under prepared to exploit future opportunities in the field. Here we propose training programs involving faculty from more than ten departments at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh that seek to move computational neuroscience into the mainstream of the field. Specifically, we seek to: 1) expose hundreds of undergraduate students in biomedical fields and hundreds of students in quantitative disciplines to computational neuroscience each year. 2) develop a comprehensive research and education program that provide excellent in depth training in computational neuroscience to 10-15 undergraduates from a variety of disciplines each year 3) develop and extend the training of our graduate students to include substantial additional education in computational neuroscience and 4) expose a group of a dozen talented students primarily from other institutions to training and research in computational neuroscience. This last group of students will consist mostly of students from groups underrepresented in the field of computational neuroscience. The training will be broad and interdisciplinary including biological and psychological approaches on the experimental side and statistical, computational and mathematical on the quantitative side.          n/a",Interdisciplinary Training in Computational Neuroscience,7495685,T90DA022762,"['Action Potentials', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Appendix', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Calculi', 'Cellular biology', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer information processing', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Ion Channel', 'Journals', 'Just-in-time-concept', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Neurobiology', 'Motivation', 'Motor Cortex', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Chemistry', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Secure', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Student Selections', 'Students', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Talents', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Visual system structure', 'Voting', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'education planning', 'electrical property', 'executive function', 'experience', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'lectures', 'ligand gated channel', 'member', 'neural model', 'neurophysiology', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'receptor function', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'second messenger', 'sensorimotor system', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'virtual', 'voltage']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,T90,2008,81160,0.13083831757380437
"Biomedical Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Genomic and other high throughput technologies in the biomedical sciences are generating overwhelming amounts of data that must be processed, analyzed, and interpreted. These massive amounts of data have created a critical need for theoretical, algorithmic, software, and hardware advances in storing, retrieving, networking, processing, modeling, visualizing, and interpreting biological and medical information. These needs continue to inspire new concepts in computer science, such as genetic algorithms, neural networks, computer viruses, and DMA computing methods. Because of these developments, computer science applications in the fields of biology and medicine showcase the latest advances in core computer science from hardware to software, from algorithms to databases, and from theory to user interfaces. This cross fertilization has enriched both fields and will continue to do so in the coming decades.      To continue to meet these challenges, the UCI Biomedical Informatics Training (BIT) Program trains   graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the interface of the life and computational sciences for   professional careers in bioinformatics and computational biology. The BIT Program, administered by the UCI Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, integrates a first year Mathematical and Computational Biology Gateway Program with biomedical informatics training programs in the UCI Schools of Biological and Physical Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, and Information and Computer Sciences. This Program emphasizes interdisciplinary teamwork using a dual mentor approach involving interdisciplinary thesis research projects. Required core courses in mathematics, statistics, and computer science provide students with the computational tools required to address complex biological questions. Regular faculty/trainee meetings, quarterly reviews, and an annual mini-symposium of student projects stimulate interaction, inform faculty of progress, and foster group cohesion as well as interdisciplinary exchange of information among trainees. In summary, the BIT Program is producing a critically-needed generation of world class scholars who will develop new bionformatics and computational biology tools to solve fundamental problems in biology and medicine for the improvement of human health.             n/a",Biomedical Informatics Training Program,7457663,T15LM007443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Belief', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Contracts', 'DNA', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ear', 'Ecology', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Mail', 'Embryology', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Equation', 'Esapent', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fertilization', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure Activities', 'Inservice Training', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Java', 'Journals', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'NIH Grants and Contracts', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Pattern Formation', 'Performance', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Evaluation', 'Programming Languages', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Pythons', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Security', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Workload', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biophysical chemistry', 'career', 'catalyst', 'cohesion', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data structure', 'day', 'design', 'design and construction', 'enzyme mechanism', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'feeding', 'high throughput technology', 'informatics training', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'lectures', 'macromolecule', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'physical science', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure prediction', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'scientific computing', 'second messenger', 'simulation', 'size', 'skills', 'social', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,T15,2008,884083,0.1210444755595914
"UNC Predoc Training Progr in Bioinformatics/Comp Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies call for a new generation of scientists equipped to extract knowledge from large biological datasets and develop and apply novel data analytical, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques. The Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) was established at UNC-Chapel Hill in the Fall 2002 to address these needs. The Program is administered by the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences (CCGS), which was formed in August 2001 with a mission of conducting basic and applied research in all areas related to genome sciences. Twelve BCB faculty members have been recruited by UNC-CH in the last two years, with specialties in evolutionary genetics, information science, proteome analysis, protein folding, statistical genetics, and mathematical biology. In total, 39 computational and experimental genomics faculty distributed among 16 departments and schools are affiliated as BCB mentors. The program consists of four key components: a colloquium, research rotations, formal coursework, and PhD research. The coursework is designed to include three tiers of formal training: prerequisite, core, and advanced courses. Eight specialized core modules have been developed for the BCB program that cover major related areas such as information theory, machine learning, sequence comparison, phylogeny, data management, ontology, data mining, biostatistics, biomolecular structure/function prediction, and modeling of complex systems. Funds are requested to support six predoctoral students for two years each. Matching support from several local industrial organizations has been committed to allow additional student support and/or industrial internships. The students will pursue PhD degrees in participating UNC-CH Departments with a common emphasis on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; future plans include transitioning into independent Phi3 granting curriculum. The requested funds will dovetail with the UNC investment in research infrastructure, faculty recruitment, and education in both genomics and bioinformatics, leveraging intramural as well as extramural industrial support to expand this vital interdisciplinary training program. n/a",UNC Predoc Training Progr in Bioinformatics/Comp Biology,7463680,T32GM067553,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Training', 'pre-doctoral']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,T32,2008,186864,0.11580165954931625

"Multimodal Neuroimaging Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to enable the development of novel interdisciplinary training programs that integrate two components 1) an NRSA predoctoral training program and 2) a Short-Term Research Education Program, which will include a non-NRSA predoctoral training program. There have been great advances in in vivo imaging techniques, which allow neuroscientists to visualize molecular, cellular, and system physiology and functions. To fully utilize neuroimaging techniques, it is important to understand underlying principles, data detection, and data modeling and visualization. Furthermore, each technique has its own strengths and limitations. In order to overcome the weakness of one neuroimaging modality, it is absolutely essential to utilize complementary imaging modalities. Often, researchers may not utilize advanced neuroimaging technologies due to the lack of proper training in these methodologies, therefore, it is crucial to train students the principles and limitations of multiple neuroimaging modalities. In order to achieve this goal, we propose to create the Multimodal Neuroimaging Training Program (T90/R90) for predoctoral and short-term summer students, which will be jointly run by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. This program will be administered by the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which seamlessly spans both institutes and is a coordinated interdisciplinary research and educational Center of international stature. Specific aims of the predoctoral training program are to 1) teach basic neuroscience for integrative neuroimaging research; 2) to teach underlying principles, modeling, and applications of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, positron emission tomography, magnetoencephalography, and optical imaging from animals to humans; and 3) to integrate multiple methods and carry out multimodal neuroimaging projects. To achieve the specific aims, trainees will take core courses and laboratory rotations, seminars and participate in an annual retreat. In addition to the graduate T90/R90 training program, the short-term Multimodal Neuroimaging Summer School (R90) is proposed to teach the synergy of multi-modal neuroimaging for targeted students and investigators who have experience in one imaging modality and want to expand their training to other modalities. The summer program will consist of basic lectures, hand-on laboratory workshop, and performing projects, emphasizing the methodologies of multiple imaging modalities. Our proposed program will train researchers for adequate handling of the increasing complexity of combining multimodal neuroimaging data with the knowledge of various data acquisition and processing approaches, and appropriate interpretations. This will speed up the synergetic application of multiple imaging modalities to basic and clinical neuroscience research in animals and humans. All training faculty have an exceptional track record of effective interdisciplinary training and cooperative research. The materials developed in this Training Program will be distributed through the web.          n/a",Multimodal Neuroimaging Training Program,7477688,T90DA022761,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cellular biology', 'Cerebellum', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer information processing', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendrites', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Fourier Transform', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Neurobiology', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Center for Research Resources', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Numbers', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Evaluation', 'Protein Chemistry', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychology', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Student Selections', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Visit', 'Visual system structure', 'Voting', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain metabolism', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'day', 'design', 'electrical property', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'interest', 'international center', 'lectures', 'ligand gated channel', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'physical science', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'receptor function', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensorimotor system', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'voltage']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,T90,2008,76913,0.11249022823563547

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7389728,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2008,373102,0.11329829337308633
"Neuro-physical-computational Sciences Graduate Training(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The proposed interdisciplinary training program at the University of Minnesota combines graduate training in the computational, chemical, physical, and engineering sciences with graduate training in neuroscience. Neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary field that uses a variety of experimental approaches to understand the development, structure, and function of the nervous system. As neuroscience matures, the need grows for quantitative modeling, physical and chemical insights, advanced technologies, and state-of-the-art hardware and software that the computational, chemical, physical and engineering sciences can provide. Therefore, interdisciplinary graduate training is needed to take the maximum advantage of these opportunities. The proposal incorporates the strengths, resources, and administrative structures of several existing graduate programs and the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute with an interdisciplinary faculty with diverse research interests, to provide a new paradigm in graduate education.   We propose to offer 5 three-year Fellowships each year to attract outstanding pre-doctoral students: Enrolling in existing degree programs in Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Neuroscience, Physics and Scientific Computation. The Fellows will be trained across disciplines using a variety of tools including special interdisciplinary coursework, research rotations, dual thesis advisors, special seminars and symposia and unique training opportunities. Each trainee's thesis work will cross the disciplines of neuroscience and the physical/computational sciences. An advisory system will help guide students through the program. Also, several mechanisms are proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of the training program. The trainees will receive instructions in the responsible conduct of research. The proposal documents the efforts that the training program and University will make to ensure that traditionally underrepresented students are recruited and included in the program. On completion the trainees will be prepared for research careers in academia, industry and government.   The overall goal is to train the next generation of scientists who can bridge the gap between biology and the physical/computational sciences. Broader impacts include advancing our understanding of the brain, cross-fertilization of the disciplines, and establishing a new model for interdisciplinary graduate training.

"Biomedical and Health Informatics Research Training Biomedical informatics spans a research space essential in a number of areas of life sciences and healthcare. The demand for well-trained research scientists in this area is exploding, although there is real need for independent research and informatics tool development, there is also an increasing emphasis on interdisciplinary research, where biomedical informaticians play a central role. We propose a combined pre- doctoral (6 positions) and post-doctoral (6 positions) research training program that prepares research fellows to become leaders in the academic and research biomedical informatics community and valuable contributors to interdisciplinary biomedical research problems. The goal of the biomedical informatics research training (BIRT) program at the University of Missouri- Columbia (MU) is to provide strong foundational training in informatics theory and methodology, build upon the fundamentals of biological and computational sciences, and prepare research fellows to assume leadership roles working on important problems in life scienes, healthcare, bioinformatics, and computational biology. MU has a strong history of biomedical informatics research training, but with implementaion of a recent planned expansion of informatics resources, our campus research community is now better positioned than ever before to be leaders in biomedical informatics research training and further strengthen life sciences and healthcare research. The creation of the MU Informatics Institute (MUM) brings together biomedical : informatics researchersfrom the campus, fully integrates faculty resources of 2 strong departments, Computer Science and Health Management and Informatics, and provides a structure for leveraging outstanding resources. The MUII will manage the PhD in Informatics program, as well as multidiscipliriary informatics research faculty and research trainees. n/a",Biomedical and Health Informatics Research

"Interdisciplinary Pre-doctoral Training Program in Neuroengineering(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Quantitative approaches have a long history in the neurosciences, having contributed to the extraordinary progress made in understanding nervous system function at all levels of biological organization--from genes to behavior. Now, investigators from a variety of disciplines are beginning to incorporate engineering approaches in analyzing brain function, manipulating brain function, and building devices that duplicate or repair function lost in the injured brain. Into this rapidly evolving field of study, Yale proposes an Interdisciplinary Graduate Training Program in Neuroengineering. This proposal comes at an auspicious and important time in Yale's history: a new department of biomedical engineering was just formed, with a new research building under construction; a new center for magnetic resonance research was just opened with state-of-the-art research imaging capabilities; and the highly collaborative neuroscience community has grown to account for more than half of the university's biomedical research activity. Predoctoral students in the Neuroengineering Program would benefit from all of these institutional resources. By bringing 19 faculty members--representing 7 different departments and a large base of federally-supported individual and team grants--together in a unified training effort, the Neuroengineering program will: 1) prepare a group of scientists by full immersion in the disciplines of biomedical engineering and neuroscience; 2) create a new and vibrant interdisciplinary community at Yale; 3) develop new didactic courses and curriculum approaches for this field of study; and 4) implement a team approach for using quantitative biomedical engineering methods for solving complex problems in neuroscience. The students trained in this interdisciplinary program will be uniquely prepared to contribute to the academic and industrial workforce, and to speed progress towards diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease in the nervous system. n/a",Interdisciplinary Pre-doctoral Training Program in Neuroengineering(RMI),7485682,T90DK070068,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Advertising', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animals', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Artificial Organs', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Biosensor', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood -

"21st-Century Imaging Sciences: Undergraduate and Graduate Student Training    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical to continued progress in imaging sciences is the integration of traditionally discrete lines of research. For example, advances in observing organelles and macromolecular complexes in living cells need to be integrated with new methodological approaches to imaging live animals; advances in biochemistry that produce novel imaging agents need to be integrated with new approaches to selective cellular delivery and employ transgenic animal models simulating human diseases. To realize the potential that evolving paradigms of molecular, cellular, live animal and human imaging offer, a cadre of 21st-century scientists must be trained-and a revolutionary synthesis of chemistry, biology, engineering, physics and mathematics must be achieved. The imaging science community at Washington University, because of its breadth, diversity and depth of funding, is in an excellent position to foster the development of a new approach by attracting and training next-generation imaging scientists. We propose to devise curricula and develop opportunities that reach out to students at the most formative stages of their academic careers-in their undergraduate and graduate years. Early access to students is imperative to develop a broadly-based academic foundation in both the physical and life sciences, and in engineering. An Undergraduate Imaging Sciences Pathway will be developed. Students in their junior and senior years will have the opportunity to take courses in chemistry, physics, computer science, engineering and molecular cell biology as they relate to imaging sciences, and to gain in-depth research experience in laboratories of imaging sciences faculty. For predoctoral students, we propose to create a Graduate Imaging Sciences Pathway that will be available to students in the biomedical sciences, physical and quantitative sciences, psychology, and engineering. We anticipate that the Graduate Pathway program will mature into a formal graduate program in 2008, when we have optimized the curriculum and developed the administrative mechanisms for interdisciplinary training of students having mentors in the Schools of Arts and Sciences, Medicine, and Engineering and Applied Sciences. We envision that a graduate student who has completed training in the Imaging Sciences Pathway or graduate program will be poised to broaden their horizons and open new opportunities for research in the new age of interdisciplinary science.

"Biomedical and Health Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI) research training program at the University of Washington has matured rapidly and successfully since its inception in 1999. UW offers a highly collaborative environment with a strong track record of interdisciplinary research initiatives, which has driven the culture and priorities of the UW BHI activities. At its core the UW program recognizes that a key characteristic of successful BHI researchers is the ability to play a leadership role in translating methods and models from the computing sciences, information sciences and behavioral sciences into tools and solutions for information related challenges and opportunities faced by care providers, patients, biomedical researchers, and public health providers. BHI researchers in this role develop new knowledge that advances the field of BHI. They can also advance knowledge in the underlying computing, information and behavioral science disciplines, as well as contributing to advancing our knowledge in the biomedical domain. The goal of the BHI program is therefore to train future research leaders in the field with translational skills and interdisciplinary expertise across the domains of bioinformatics, clinical informatics, and public health informatics. The UW training program consists of: a) a core curriculum of foundational concepts in the field that reach across the discipline, b) core   domain courses (clinical, biological, and public health), c) methodology courses (research methods,   pedagogy, and biostatistics), and d) individualized in depth electives in foundational and domain areas.   UW received its initial NLM-supported training grant in 2002; since then the BHI program has admitted four cohorts of students, including 27 NLM funded trainees, and graduated its first PhD student along with 15 research-focused MS students. Although relatively young, the training program has evolved significantly; processes for recruitment, admissions, mentoring, and optimizing trainee progress have been refined, as has the core curriculum. To maintain this success UW proposes to continue the NLM training program, seeking funding to support 18 trainees each year over the 2007-2012 cycle. This would permit recruitment of 4-5 new predoctoral trainees and 2 new post-doctoral trainees each year. As we continue to build our program we plan to continue to expand our interdisciplinary research collaborations in general with two strategic areas of focus in particular: a) leveraging UW strengths in Genome Sciences to further develop bioinformatics interdisciplinary collaborations, and b) leveraging UW history of excellence in clinical research by helping support a broad UW effort to establish an Institute for Clinical and Translational Science.             n/a",Biomedical and Health Informatics Training Program,7470075,T15LM007442,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Admission activity',

"Biomedical and Health Informatics Training Program The Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI) research training program at the University of Washington has matured rapidly and successfully since its inception in 1999. UWoffers a highly collaborative environment with a strong track record of interdisciplinary research initiatives, which has driven the culture and priorities of the UW BHI activities. At its core the UW program recognizes that a key characteristic of successful BHI researchers is the ability to play a leadership role in translating methods and models from the computing sciences, information sciences and behavioral sciences into tools and solutions for information related challenges and opportunities faced by care providers, patients, biomedical researchers, and public health providers. BHI researchers in this role develop new knowledge that advancesthe field of BHI. They can also advance knowledge in the underlying computing, information and behavioral science disciplines, as well as contributing to advancing our knowledge in the biomedical domain. The goal of the BHI program is therefore to train future research leaders in the field with translational skills and interdisciplinary expertise across the domains of bioinformatics, clinical informatics, and public health informatics. The UWtraining program consists of: a) a core curriculum of foundational concepts in the field that reach across the discipline, b) core domain courses (clinical, biological, and public health), c) methodology courses (research methods, pedagogy, and biostatistics), and d) individualized in depth electives in foundational and domain areas. UW received its initial NLM-supported training grant in 2002; since then the BHI program has admitted four cohorts of students, including 27 NLMfunded trainees, and graduated its first PhD student along with 15 research-focused MS students. Although relatively young, the training program has evolved significantly; processes for recruitment, admissions, mentoring, and optimizing trainee progress have been refined, as has the core curriculum. To maintain this success UW proposes to continue the NLM training program, seeking funding to support 18 trainees each year over the 2007-2012 cycle. This would permit recruitment of 4-5 new predoctoral trainees and 2 new post-doctoral trainees each year. As we continue to build our programwe plan to continue to expand our interdisciplinary research collaborations in general with two strategic areas of focus in particular: a) leveraging UW strengths in Genome Sciences to further develop bioinformatics interdisciplinary collaborations, and b) leveraging UW history of excellence in clinical research by helping support a broad UW effort to establish an Institute for Clinical and Translational Science. n/a",Biomedical and Health Informatics Training Program,7587202,T15LM007442,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy',

"NLM Training Program in Biomedical Informatics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For almost two decades, the W. M. Keck Center, which spans six biomedical institutions in the Greater   Houston, Texas area, has trained pre- and postdoctoral fellows in biomedical informatics. Here we seek the renewal of one of our training programs (the NLMTP), which the National Library of Medicine has supported for fifteen years. When we began the NLMTP, we foresaw that computational biology would reshape medicine in important ways, and so emphasized this emerging discipline in the research experiences our trainees. Now that computational biology has a firmly established place in biomedicine, in the NLMTP renewal, we will emphasize clinical informatics more heavily and broaden our focus to include translational medicine, public health, biosecurity, applied nanotechnology and computational biomedical engineering. In the NLMTP, we will exploit the Keck Center's considerable strengths in simulation and imaging, statistical and computational biomedicine, clinical decision-making and deep expertise regarding biological structure and function. And we will employ processes for recruiting, selecting, monitoring and assessing trainees that have proved so successful in the Keck Center over the years.             n/a",NLM Training Program in

"Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to PAR-03-034 ""Neuroinformatics Institutional Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K12)."" The overarching goal of this application is to provide an excellent postdoctoral training program in neuroimaging neuroinformatics that capitalizes on the many strengths of the existing neuroscientists, informatics and imaging resources that our combined resources represent. Our proposed Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program (NNTP) is based upon a number of important strategic alliances. The first cornerstone of this effort is the existing HBP grants held by Dr. Anders Dale (R01 NS39581: Cortical-Surface-Based Brain Imaging) and Dr. David Kennedy (R01 NS34189: Anatomic Morphologic Analysis of MR Brain Images). These efforts span a wealth of technological developments, research and clinical application areas in the rapidly developing area of quantitative morphometric image analysis. A second and vital cornerstone is our association with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Biomedical Informatics Program. This existing pre- and post-graduate academic program, within a world class biomedical engineering department, is an ideal setting for the development of a coordinated training effort in Neuroinformatics. The established track record in training skilled scientists in areas of informatics will prove invaluable in this new initiative. The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees. A plan for recruiting, selecting and monitoring trainees is proposed. This program will be an asset to the Neuroinformatics initiatives of the Human Brain Project by helping to prepare future scientists with advanced neuroinformatics skills         n/a",Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program,7189144,K12MH069281,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Informatics Research Network', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Activities', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Program Development', 'Psyche structure', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SECTM1 gene', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Woman', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'brain morphology', 'career', 'cationic antimicrobial protein CAP 37', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'imaging informatics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSP,K12,2007,450967,0.12284290817640765
"Training in Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Columbia University proposes to continue its NLM-supported training program in biomedical informatics, initiated in 1992, expanded in 1997, and renewed in 2002. Our goal is to help to shape the evolving discipline of biomedical informatics by defining a rigorous, academically-oriented training program that offers complementary exposures to real-world systems, both in clinical settings here at CUMC/NYPH and in the biological sciences through the Columbia Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Our training program seeks to further the development of the field, and the quality of future research, by demonstrating to its students, and to the biomedical community, that biomedical informatics addresses fundamental issues of biomedical knowledge and information, their representation, and their biomedical application. We have accordingly developed and evolved a curriculum that assures that our graduates will be familiar with a broad range of pertinent topics in the field. Each trainee then selects an area of subspecialization within the field, with the established tracks being clinical informatics, public health informatics, imaging informatics, or bioinformatics. Our degrees generally require a minimum of two years for the MA and four years for the Ph.D., although most students take somewhat.      We are proposing to enroll 10 NLM-suported predoctoral trainees and 8 NLM-supported postdoctoral trainees per year (with 1 additional predoc and 2 additional postdocs in Years 1 and 2 due to a supplement we have already received for Public Health Informatics training). We expect over 50 graduate students and post-doctoral trainees in our entire (NLM and non-NLM) program in September 2006. Among our 103 graduates since approval of our degree program, we have graduated 16 PhD students, 7 of whom were NLM-supported.

The program has particular strength in bioinformatics and clinical translational research. However, Stanford's research milieu provides excellent opportunities for basic informatics research in other areas as well. We are in the 22nd year as an NLM supported training program, with a steady state of about 32 total students. We have produced 102 graduates, 55 of whom were NLM-supported at some period. In this proposal, we request continuing support for the training of fourteen pre-doctoral and four post-doctoral candidates per year, representing a small shift in balance in response to our applicant pool. Most training slots will be used for BMI degree candidates, although we will take advantage of program flexibility to fund a small number of post-MD or Ph.D. candidates who are not BMI degree candidates. We are currently receiving more than 80 applications for 4-8 total spots in our program (a subset of which are NLM supported). We propose to continue our successful training program in the next five years, with an expanded executive committee, increased recruitment of participating faculty, a consulting service to allow students to have direct contact with biomedical researchers, and a continuing plan for increased affirmative action recruitment of women and minority students. The BMI program will therefore continue to produce leaders in academic and industrial biomedical informatics, and will continue to respond to the changing landscape of biomedical research in the information age.             n/a",Graduate Training in Biomedical Informatics,7213982,T15LM007033,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Advertising', 'Age', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Aptitude', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arizona', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Baltimore', 'Baptist Church', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'British', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Chicago', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Skills', 'Collaborations', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conflict of Interest', 'Consensus', 'Consent', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Credentialing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Analysis', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dill', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distance Learning', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genomics', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hong Kong', 'Hour', 'Humanities', 'Indium', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Interview', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Laws', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Legal', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Missouri', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Newsletter', 'Notification', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Oral', 'Oral Examination', 'Oral cavity', 'Palate', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placement', 'Pliability', 'Policies', 'Polishes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prize', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Proceedings and Conferences', 'Proceedings, Conference', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Range', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Request for Applications', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Review Literature', 'Rotation', 'Rural', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Services', 'Singapore', 'Site', 'Social Policies', 'Societies', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taiwan', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tokyo', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'Washington', 'Week', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'college', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'day', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'experience', 'foot', 'informatics training', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'model design', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'protein structure prediction', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'wiki']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,T15,2007,1177540,0.17032029621839243

"Training in Biomedical Discovery from Large Scale Data Sets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of genomics, proteomics and advanced imaging technology has resulted in the accumulation of vast amounts of biological data. As large scale data sets become predominant in biomedical research, we are approaching a paradigm shift in which the process of discovery is data-driven, and in which data are the source of hypotheses as well as the means for testing them. These masses of data are rich sources of information; however, extracting meaningful information can be a daunting challenge, and often presents a bottleneck for the discovery process. Thus, there is a pressing need for interdisciplinary training of scientists who understand the data, how they are generated, and what they are used for. In addition, these scientists must become developers and highly skilled users of the new computational tools necessary to analyze large data sets. The goal of this program is to train students to become proficient in the following areas: 1. Data acquisition. This will include knowledge of the methods of genomics, proteomics and imaging. 2. Computation. This will include knowledge of mathematical and statistical algorithms, implementation of effective computer codes as well as an emphasis on methods of data warehousing in relational, deductive and other databases. 3. Data integration. This is a critical area that involves extracting useful information from the heterogeneous data sets at various spatial and temporal scales. It will include knowledge of methods of modeling and simulation of systems from the molecular to the organism level. There will also be an emphasis on computational data mining methods. The core of the program will be research-based training in interdisciplinary teams under the guidance of at least two mentors from disparate disciplines (i.e., computational/mathematical and biomedical sciences). Training activities will consist of specialized didactic coursework as well as seminars, journal clubs and a student-faculty retreat. This will be a cross-institutional training program with faculty drawn from departments ranging from computer science and statistics to genetics and medicine, in five participating institutions in the Gulf Coast Consortia in the Houston Area. The training of scientists equipped to manage and extract information from large data sets will greatly facilitate biological discovery in areas such as infectious disease and cancer and therefore this training program will have a direct, positive impact on public health.           n/a",Training in Biomedical Discovery from Large Scale Data Sets,7293588,T90DA022885,"['Advertising', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Annual Reports', 'Apoptosis', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Biotechnology', 'Case Study', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Members', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Counseling', 'Country', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Documentation', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Status', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Figs -

"Integrative Neuronal Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests renewal of its major training grant. The department is organized to promote interdisciplinary graduate training and research in neuroscience and behavior, approached with the experimental power of modern cellular and molecular neuroscience, systems neuroscience and cognitive science, combined with the theoretical strength of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Trainees begin laboratory work under one or more advisors through lab rotations in the first term and subsequently join a laboratory, working on problems in learning and memory, neural development, vision, or motor control. Required coursework can be completed in two to three years, with a two-term sequence of core courses in the first year and a flexible array of graduate lecture courses, seminars, and guided reading. Oral and written reports to the faculty and at professional meetings and in journals mark the students' progress through completion of a thesis which is usually based on the second major project, begun by the third year. Most students continue in research careers, armed with skills that typically span multiple disciplines across cellular and molecular neuroscience, systems neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, neuropsychology, psychophysics, and computation.       Trainees will, in general, have strong backgrounds in the natural sciences (e.g., undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics or electrical engineering). Occasional trainees will already hold a master's degree in another field. Candidates for the graduate program will be chosen by the department Graduate Committee constituted for the purpose of overseeing this program and will be evaluated on the basis of interviews, talent for research as demonstrated by past performance, letters of recommendation, grades, and GRE scores.       Funds are requested for 5 years to support 12 trainees per year.          n/a",Integrative Neuronal Systems,7168758,T32GM007484,[' '],NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,T32,2007,476231,0.13571833128685898
"Boston-Area Research Training Program in Biomedical Informatics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The centrality of informatics in all aspects of biomedical science and in health care practice highlights the need for well-trained individuals capable of carrying out and leading multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research in this discipline. This proposal is aimed at continuing and improving upon a Boston-area Biomedical Informatics Research Training (BIRT) program, which has this mission. BIRT brings together in a coordinated program a wide variety of activities already under way at MIT, Harvard, affiliated institutes and area hospitals. Training will focus on three main areas: (1) bioinformatics, (2) clinical/health systems informatics, and (3) public health informatics. Because of complementary predoctoral training support for area (1), BIRT will not duplicate that, but will support training in this area for originally undifferentiated predoctoral students discovering interest in bioinformatics, for transition into the other training program, and for postdoctoral fellows. Besides addressing in-depth needs of each focus area, the goal for BIRT is to provide an integrated and comprehensive approach to addressing common methodologies, infrastructure challenges, and cross-cutting problems, and to develop critical mass and synergies, to enhance mentoring and career development of trainees. The administrative and academic home of the BIRT program is the joint Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. A new Harvard Medical School Center for Biomedical Informatics will seek to imbue a culture of collaboration and interaction for research and training, through a variety of initiatives. We are requesting support in the BIRT program for 5 predoctoral students and 19 postdoctoral fellows per year, almost all of whom will be in research MS or PhD programs. The wide   variety of courses at Harvard and MIT, multiple productive research centers, and strong mentoring records of a distinguished faculty give both depth and breadth to this venue for training. New courses will be developed over the next several years, and the areas of concentration further delineated and strengthened.

"Boston-Area Research Training Program in Biomedical Informatics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The centrality of informatics in all aspects of biomedical science and in health care practice highlights the need for well-trained individuals capable of carrying out and leading multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research in this discipline. This proposal is aimed at continuing and improving upon a Boston-area Biomedical Informatics Research Training (BIRT) program, which has this mission. BIRT brings together in a coordinated program a wide variety of activities already under way at MIT, Harvard, affiliated institutes and area hospitals. Training will focus on three main areas: (1) bioinformatics, (2) clinical/health systems informatics, and (3) public health informatics. Because of complementary predoctoral training support for area (1), BIRT will not duplicate that, but will support training in this area for originally undifferentiated predoctoral students discovering interest in bioinformatics, for transition into the other training program, and for postdoctoral fellows. Besides addressing in-depth needs of each focus area, the goal for BIRT is to provide an integrated and comprehensive approach to addressing common methodologies, infrastructure challenges, and cross-cutting problems, and to develop critical mass and synergies, to enhance mentoring and career development of trainees. The administrative and academic home of the BIRT program is the joint Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. A new Harvard Medical School Center for Biomedical Informatics will seek to imbue a culture of collaboration and interaction for research and training, through a variety of initiatives. We are requesting support in the BIRT program for 5 predoctoral students and 19 postdoctoral fellows per year, almost all of whom will be in research MS or PhD programs. The wide   variety of courses at Harvard and MIT, multiple productive research centers, and strong mentoring records of a distinguished faculty give both depth and breadth to this venue for training. New courses will be developed over the next several years, and the areas of concentration further delineated and strengthened. Continued monitoring of our trainees and graduates will be carried out to aid in program assessment and improvement:             n/a",Boston-Area Research Training Program in Biomedical Informatics,7214362,T15LM007092,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anticoagulation', 'Appointment', 'Aptitude', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biometry', 'Biophysics', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body of uterus', 'Books', 'Boston', 'Calculi', 'Calendar', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Tuberculosis', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cations', 'Cell Cycle Kinetics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular biology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Skills', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Coronary artery', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Critiques', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Theory', 'Decision Trees', 'Depth', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disasters', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Disease regression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Epidemiology, Other', 'Ethics', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Figs -

"Medical Imaging Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The objective of this grant is to support training of the upcoming generation of scientists in medical imaging informatics. The next significant challenge in biomedical informatics will be to support new knowledge discovery: thus, the application domain of this training program will be on informatics in support of clinical and translational research. In addition to existing informatics research, fundamental theories and developments from a spectrum of disciplines (computer science, applied math, statistics, medicine) will be required to facilitate such informatics research, and must be integrated into a forward-looking training program. This program further focuses on imaging informatics: with the now ubiquitous usage of imaging as an in vivo method for objectively documenting and understanding human disease, new and unique research challenges arise in the acquisition, the understanding, and the usage of such data towards creating novel insights.      Evolving from the current UCLA NLM training grant in imaging-based medical informatics, doctoral (PhD) and postdoctoral training are offered through an approved degree-granting track in medical imaging informatics in the UCLA Biomedical Engineering Interdepartmental Program. The program consists of a comprehensive one year core curriculum that provides a breadth of understanding in biomedical informatics (medical data standards and information architectures; knowledge representation; medical decision making; information extraction/ retrieval; bioinformatics) and the underlying principles of medical image acquisition, standardization, and content understanding. Further specialization is achieved through subsequent elective courses that provide expertise in a given informatics area. Importantly, the program stresses informatics research and its subsequent   application, requiring trainees to conduct novel and innovative investigations as part of the course of   study. Core faculty are drawn from an interdisciplinary group of researchers in the UCLA Schools of Medicine, Engineering, Letters & Sciences, and Information Studies. This program will be able to leverage the wide array of biomedical and informatics endeavors from its core faculty and across the UCLA campus to provide students with numerous opportunities for research. Additionally, this training program will support short-term summer training for undergraduate students to encourage interest in biomedical and imaging informatics graduate work.             n/a",Medical Imaging Informatics Training Program,7213956,T15LM007356,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Academic Training', 'Accent', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advertising', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Aptitude', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Body of uterus', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Calculi', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Cations', 'Causations', 'Chemistry', 'Chest', 'Childhood', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer information processing', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Creativeness', 'Cytogenetics', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Decision Theory', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Digital Libraries', 'Directories', 'Discipline', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Distributed Databases', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Ecology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Figs -

"Vanderbilt Biomedical Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Vanderbilt University proposes a five-year renewal of its Biomedical Informatics Training Program. Begun in 2001, the program offers MS and PhD degrees in Biomedical Informatics, as well as nondegree postdoctoral and short-term training experiences. The program has experienced steady growth in high quality applicants and currently has more than 20 trainees, including 16 predoctoral and postdoctoral students funded by our NLM training grant, now in its fourth year. The Training Program's administrative home, the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI), has likewise grown - in faculty, resources, and productivity - to become widely regarded as among the top informatics programs nationally. The informatics-rich environments of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System provide ""hands on"" training experiences that are exemplary. The MS and PhD degree programs include a core curriculum of courses in biomedical informatics and the foundation disciplines of computer science, biomedicine, and research methodology. Degree-seeking students pursue concentrated study in one of several application domains, including clinical informatics and bioinformatics, and the emerging areas of clinical research and translational informatics and organizational informatics now under development. We continue to offer research-intensive nondegree postdoctoral fellowships. For the period 2007-2012, Vanderbilt requests a total of 16 full-time training positions (10 predoctoral and 6 postdoctoral) and 4 shortterm   training positions per year. Through the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance, we will continue to recruit Meharry   students, graduates, and residents who seek training in biomedical informatics and expand recruitment   efforts to underrepresented minorities from other institutions. Since its inception in 1991, the Vanderbilt   Biomedical Informatics initiative has had one, key unifying idea: the best research and the best innovation arise from a deep understanding of the problems being addressed, and a commitment to creating tools and systems that serve real-world needs. Application and evaluation of these informatics innovations results in scalable tools that address today's most urgent challenges in healthcare delivery, biomedical research, and health professions education. Vanderbilt biomedical informatics graduates will become the next generation of scholars and innovators, leading the charge against these and other challenges not yet imagined.

"Vanderbilt Biomedical Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Vanderbilt University proposes a five-year renewal of its Biomedical Informatics Training Program. Begun in 2001, the program offers MS and PhD degrees in Biomedical Informatics, as well as nondegree postdoctoral and short-term training experiences. The program has experienced steady growth in high quality applicants and currently has more than 20 trainees, including 16 predoctoral and postdoctoral students funded by our NLM training grant, now in its fourth year. The Training Program's administrative home, the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI), has likewise grown - in faculty, resources, and productivity - to become widely regarded as among the top informatics programs nationally. The informatics-rich environments of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System provide ""hands on"" training experiences that are exemplary. The MS and PhD degree programs include a core curriculum of courses in biomedical informatics and the foundation disciplines of computer science, biomedicine, and research methodology. Degree-seeking students pursue concentrated study in one of several application domains, including clinical informatics and bioinformatics, and the emerging areas of clinical research and translational informatics and organizational informatics now under development. We continue to offer research-intensive nondegree postdoctoral fellowships. For the period 2007-2012, Vanderbilt requests a total of 16 full-time training positions (10 predoctoral and 6 postdoctoral) and 4 shortterm   training positions per year. Through the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance, we will continue to recruit Meharry   students, graduates, and residents who seek training in biomedical informatics and expand recruitment   efforts to underrepresented minorities from other institutions. Since its inception in 1991, the Vanderbilt   Biomedical Informatics initiative has had one, key unifying idea: the best research and the best innovation arise from a deep understanding of the problems being addressed, and a commitment to creating tools and systems that serve real-world needs. Application and evaluation of these informatics innovations results in scalable tools that address today's most urgent challenges in healthcare delivery, biomedical research, and health professions education. Vanderbilt biomedical informatics graduates will become the next generation of scholars and innovators, leading the charge against these and other challenges not yet imagined.

"Research Training in Health Protection and Preparedness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Profound and ongoing advances in biomedical science are not being translated effectively into improvements in the overall health of the American public. Though many programs train basic and clinical research scientists, training in research at the interface of medicine and public health is scarce. Addressing this deficiency is vital to the public health. The goal of the New York University School of Medicine proposal is to solidify and evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative new program to train post-doctoral, physician fellows in health protection and preparedness research and create sustainable research linkages between academic institutions and front-line public health agencies. After a rigorous and focused curriculum in core public health disciplines and research methods, fellows work with one of a cadre of outstanding mentors investigating real-world challenges at the interface of medicine and public health. Organizational partners include the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and the New York University Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and Response, allowing for a broad diversity in exposure to health protection and preparedness research as well as bidirectional transfer of experience and expertise. The initial cohort of six fellows (from three disciplines), now mid-way through this two year Master's in Science degree granting program, is engaged in diverse research initiatives on topics from colorectal cancer screening among immigrants to health literacy interventions to improve care of pediatric patients in emergency departments to exploring the power of natural language processing for medical record-based detection of medical errors, with implications for syndromic surveillance. The Division of General Internal Medicine at New York University School of Medicine is committed to developing a Center for Population Health Research and Training that can meaningfully contribute to building the Nation's supply of physician public health researchers.             n/a",Research Training in Health Protection and Preparedness,7271607,T01CD000146,[' '],ODCDC,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,T01,2007,1254293,0.04676030246103848
"Pittsburgh Biomedical Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The University of Pittsburgh proposes a five-year renewal of its training program in Biomedical Informatics. This program has grown significantly since its inception in 1987. It currently has 40 trainees, 12 of whom are supported by the training grant. Trainees seek academic degrees through one of two programs. The majority of students obtain degrees through the Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Training Program, which is offered through the School of Medicine. Most trainees study in the general BMI degree track. In addition, the program has concentrations in bioinformatics, dental informatics, health services research, library informatics, and public health surveillance for trainees with those special interests. Students with a special interest in artificial intelligence in medicine can obtain degrees through the Biomedical Informatics track of the Intelligent Systems Program (ISP). Both the BMI Training Program and the ISP offer M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. The BMI Training Program also offers a one-year Certificate option. Since the BMI and ISP training programs are tightly linked and coordinated through their faculty and staff, for brevity we refer to them as one program below.      Graduates of the program are finding excellent employment opportunities. The program is supported by   an interdepartmental core faculty with 30 members, all of whom are experienced educators and active   researchers. It is administered through the University's Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI), which   provides administrative support, space, and equipment for the trainees.

"Doctoral Training in Bioinformatics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomics is revolutionizing research in evolution, developmental biology and, more generally, in the molecular biology of the cell in normal and pathological states. It promises to revolutionize medicine by the development of new diagnostics based on molecular fingerprints, the identification of drug targets, and individualized medicine. The revolution rests on high throughput experimental methods, closely associated high throughput computational methods--machine learning algorithms, mathematical statistics and the like---and modem information technologies that permit easy many to many communication between thousands of users. Our Ph.D. Program in Bioinformatics is currently directed at training two different groups: researchers who will become professionals in the field; i.e. who will move it forward by the development of new methods required for creative experimental research; and biomedical researchers who will be users of the technologies. Because computation and experiment are tightly coupled, all students in the Program must have hands on experience at the bench in addition to intensive training in computational methods. In recognition of the profound effect these technologies are likely to have on the social fabric, all students are required to take a core, full-credit course on legal and ethical implications of genomics.             n/a",Doctoral Training in Bioinformatics,7255633,T32GM070409,"['Bioinformatics', 'Training']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),T32,2007,178071,0.06192845560799187
"Interdisciplinary Training in Computational Neuroscience    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroscience increasingly requires the integration of sophisticated experimental and quantitative approaches. The development of increasingly sophisticated models and the analysis of massive sources of data routinely push neuroscientists to the limits of their quantitative and analytical abilities. In this way, computational neuroscience has become an element of the mainstream of neuroscience research. However, few training programs have adapted to this increase in the importance of quantitative approaches in neuroscience, leaving many students under prepared to exploit future opportunities in the field. Here we propose training programs involving faculty from more than ten departments at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh that seek to move computational neuroscience into the mainstream of the field. Specifically, we seek to: 1) expose hundreds of undergraduate students in biomedical fields and hundreds of students in quantitative disciplines to computational neuroscience each year. 2) develop a comprehensive research and education program that provide excellent in depth training in computational neuroscience to 10-15 undergraduates from a variety of disciplines each year 3) develop and extend the training of our graduate students to include substantial additional education in computational neuroscience and 4) expose a group of a dozen talented students primarily from other institutions to training and research in computational neuroscience. This last group of students will consist mostly of students from groups underrepresented in the field of computational neuroscience. The training will be broad and interdisciplinary including biological and psychological approaches on the experimental side and statistical, computational and mathematical on the quantitative side.          n/a",Interdisciplinary Training in Computational Neuroscience,7293612,T90DA022762,"['Action Potentials', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Appendix', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Calculi', 'Cellular biology', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer information processing', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Employment', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Ion Channel', 'Journals', 'Just-in-time-concept', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Neurobiology', 'Motivation', 'Motor Cortex', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Chemistry', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Secure', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Student Selections', 'Students', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Talents', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Visual system structure', 'Voting', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'education planning', 'electrical property', 'executive function', 'experience', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'lectures', 'ligand gated channel', 'member', 'neural model', 'neurophysiology', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'receptor function', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'second messenger', 'sensorimotor system', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'virtual', 'voltage']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,T90,2007,39770,0.13083831757380437
"Visual Cognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The training program in Visual Cognition is based on the beliefs that vision is central to the understanding of the mind, and that it can now only be studied in a way that integrates knowledge and methods from many traditional disciplines (cognitive psychology, psychophysics, neuroscience, neuropsychology, computer vision). This requires new generations of scientists whose training encompasses all these disciplines. MIT is a perfect site for such a program because of its long history of accomplishments in vision science (both research and training), the unusual composition of the department (experimental psychology, computation, and neuroscience), and its experience and infrastructure for an interdisciplinary training program contributed by the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. The program has provided predoctoral students with core courses in cognitive science and neuroscience, extensive research experience, oral and written qualifying exams, lecture courses and research seminars, experience and training in undergraduate teaching, close oversight of progress, repeated oral presentations, and immersion in a peer culture of students and fellows interested in visual cognition. Now is a crucial time for the renewal of this training grant because of the great expansion in vision research we expect in our department over the next few years, resulting from the increased access to brain imaging equipment at the new MIT-MGH Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, and from the numerous new hires expected in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research (of which the PI is a member), several of whom are likely to work on high-level vision.         n/a",Visual Cognition,7250287,T32MH020007,['visual cognition'],NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,T32,2007,143182,0.09081376727533433
"Biomedical Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Genomic and other high throughput technologies in the biomedical sciences are generating overwhelming amounts of data that must be processed, analyzed, and interpreted. These massive amounts of data have created a critical need for theoretical, algorithmic, software, and hardware advances in storing, retrieving, networking, processing, modeling, visualizing, and interpreting biological and medical information. These needs continue to inspire new concepts in computer science, such as genetic algorithms, neural networks, computer viruses, and DMA computing methods. Because of these developments, computer science applications in the fields of biology and medicine showcase the latest advances in core computer science from hardware to software, from algorithms to databases, and from theory to user interfaces. This cross fertilization has enriched both fields and will continue to do so in the coming decades.      To continue to meet these challenges, the UCI Biomedical Informatics Training (BIT) Program trains   graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the interface of the life and computational sciences for   professional careers in bioinformatics and computational biology. The BIT Program, administered by the UCI Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, integrates a first year Mathematical and Computational Biology Gateway Program with biomedical informatics training programs in the UCI Schools of Biological and Physical Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, and Information and Computer Sciences. This Program emphasizes interdisciplinary teamwork using a dual mentor approach involving interdisciplinary thesis research projects. Required core courses in mathematics, statistics, and computer science provide students with the computational tools required to address complex biological questions. Regular faculty/trainee meetings, quarterly reviews, and an annual mini-symposium of student projects stimulate interaction, inform faculty of progress, and foster group cohesion as well as interdisciplinary exchange of information among trainees. In summary, the BIT Program is producing a critically-needed generation of world class scholars who will develop new bionformatics and computational biology tools to solve fundamental problems in biology and medicine for the improvement of human health.             n/a",Biomedical Informatics Training Program,7214290,T15LM007443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Belief', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Contracts', 'DNA', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ear', 'Ecology', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Mail', 'Embryology', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Equation', 'Esapent', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fertilization', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure Activities', 'Inservice Training', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Java', 'Journals', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'NIH Grants and Contracts', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Pattern Formation', 'Performance', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Evaluation', 'Programming Languages', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Pythons', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Security', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Today', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Workload', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biophysical chemistry', 'career', 'catalyst', 'cohesion', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data structure', 'day', 'design', 'design and construction', 'enzyme mechanism', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'feeding', 'high throughput technology', 'informatics training', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'lectures', 'macromolecule', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'physical science', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure prediction', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'scientific computing', 'second messenger', 'simulation', 'size', 'skills', 'social', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,T15,2007,1008201,0.1210444755595914
"UNC Predoc Training Progr in Bioinformatics/Comp Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies call for a new generation of scientists equipped to extract knowledge from large biological datasets and develop and apply novel data analytical, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques. The Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) was established at UNC-Chapel Hill in the Fall 2002 to address these needs. The Program is administered by the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences (CCGS), which was formed in August 2001 with a mission of conducting basic and applied research in all areas related to genome sciences. Twelve BCB faculty members have been recruited by UNC-CH in the last two years, with specialties in evolutionary genetics, information science, proteome analysis, protein folding, statistical genetics, and mathematical biology. In total, 39 computational and experimental genomics faculty distributed among 16 departments and schools are affiliated as BCB mentors. The program consists of four key components: a colloquium, research rotations, formal coursework, and PhD research. The coursework is designed to include three tiers of formal training: prerequisite, core, and advanced courses. Eight specialized core modules have been developed for the BCB program that cover major related areas such as information theory, machine learning, sequence comparison, phylogeny, data management, ontology, data mining, biostatistics, biomolecular structure/function prediction, and modeling of complex systems. Funds are requested to support six predoctoral students for two years each. Matching support from several local industrial organizations has been committed to allow additional student support and/or industrial internships. The students will pursue PhD degrees in participating UNC-CH Departments with a common emphasis on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; future plans include transitioning into independent Phi3 granting curriculum. The requested funds will dovetail with the UNC investment in research infrastructure, faculty recruitment, and education in both genomics and bioinformatics, leveraging intramural as well as extramural industrial support to expand this vital interdisciplinary training program. n/a",UNC Predoc Training Progr in Bioinformatics/Comp Biology,7254676,T32GM067553,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Training', 'pre-doctoral']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,T32,2007,149491,0.11580165954931625
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to enable the development of novel interdisciplinary training programs that integrate two components 1) an NRSA predoctoral training program and 2) a Short-Term Research Education Program, which will include a non-NRSA predoctoral training program. There have been great advances in in vivo imaging techniques, which allow neuroscientists to visualize molecular, cellular, and system physiology and functions. To fully utilize neuroimaging techniques, it is important to understand underlying principles, data detection, and data modeling and visualization. Furthermore, each technique has its own strengths and limitations. In order to overcome the weakness of one neuroimaging modality, it is absolutely essential to utilize complementary imaging modalities. Often, researchers may not utilize advanced neuroimaging technologies due to the lack of proper training in these methodologies, therefore, it is crucial to train students the principles and limitations of multiple neuroimaging modalities. In order to achieve this goal, we propose to create the Multimodal Neuroimaging Training Program (T90/R90) for predoctoral and short-term summer students, which will be jointly run by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. This program will be administered by the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which seamlessly spans both institutes and is a coordinated interdisciplinary research and educational Center of international stature. Specific aims of the predoctoral training program are to 1) teach basic neuroscience for integrative neuroimaging research; 2) to teach underlying principles, modeling, and applications of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, positron emission tomography, magnetoencephalography, and optical imaging from animals to humans; and 3) to integrate multiple methods and carry out multimodal neuroimaging projects. To achieve the specific aims, trainees will take core courses and laboratory rotations, seminars and participate in an annual retreat. In addition to the graduate T90/R90 training program, the short-term Multimodal Neuroimaging Summer School (R90) is proposed to teach the synergy of multi-modal neuroimaging for targeted students and investigators who have experience in one imaging modality and want to expand their training to other modalities. The summer program will consist of basic lectures, hand-on laboratory workshop, and performing projects, emphasizing the methodologies of multiple imaging modalities. Our proposed program will train researchers for adequate handling of the increasing complexity of combining multimodal neuroimaging data with the knowledge of various data acquisition and processing approaches, and appropriate interpretations. This will speed up the synergetic application of multiple imaging modalities to basic and clinical neuroscience research in animals and humans. All training faculty have an exceptional track record of effective interdisciplinary training and cooperative research. The materials developed in this Training Program will be distributed through the web.          n/a",Multimodal Neuroimaging Training Program,7294254,T90DA022761,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cellular biology', 'Cerebellum', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer information processing', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendrites', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Fourier Transform', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Neurobiology', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Center for Research Resources', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Numbers', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Evaluation', 'Protein Chemistry', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychology', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Student Selections', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Visit', 'Visual system structure', 'Voting', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain metabolism', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data modeling', 'day', 'design', 'electrical property', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'interest', 'international center', 'lectures', 'ligand gated channel', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'physical science', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'receptor function', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensorimotor system', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'voltage']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,T90,2007,38456,0.11249022823563547

"University of Utah Medical Informatics Training The University of Utah is applying for the second renewal of its training grant with the National Library of Medicine (NLM). Our long term objective is to continue a program of research informatics excellence, carrying forward a tradition that dates back to 1964. In the five years since our first renewal, 103 graduate students have entered training. In our total 10 years of funding, over 60 NLM-funded graduate students have completed training or are currently working towards a degree. We currently have 41 predoctoral and 30 postdoctoral candidates for a total of 71 active students; over 40% of whom are focused on doctoral research. Twenty to thirty percent of all Departmental graduate students have been supported by the NLM training grant over the past ten years. The specific aims of this proposal center on training graduate and postdoctoral students to develop broad informatics research expertise in clinical, public health, and translational/genetic application areas. Under the direction of a new Department Chair, who is also the PI of this grant, we have recently revised and updated our core curriculum that stresses 20 core competencies under the broad rubrics of foundational skills and applications proficiency. This curriculum review is also creating focus for our three training areas and the development of new training courses and experiences. The Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Utah is in the process of growth and change with new leadership, and here we describe our training successes to date as well as our expanded scope of training for this new funding period. Public Health Informatics has been defined as the study of systems for creating information and managing knowledge to understand, protect, and improve health in society. Our public health informatics program will train students in the development and application of technologies that will aid public health practitioners in these activities. We will train students to build tools that will assist educators, researchers, physicians, and individuals in the community to define and address public health issues. n/a",University of Utah Medical

"University of Utah Biomedical Informatics Training    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The University of Utah is applying for the second renewal of its training grant with the National Library of Medicine (NLM). Our long term objective is to continue a program of research informatics excellence,   carrying forward a tradition that dates back to 1964. In the five years since our first renewal, 103 graduate students have entered training. In our total 10 years of funding, over 60 NLM-funded graduate students have completed training or are currently working towards a degree.      We currently have 41 predoctoral and 30 postdoctoral candidates for a total of 71 active students; over 40% of whom are focused on doctoral research. Twenty to thirty percent of all Departmental graduate students have been supported by the NLM training grant over the past ten years.      The specific aims of this proposal center on training graduate and postdoctoral students to develop broad informatics research expertise in clinical, public health, and translational/genetic application areas. Under the direction of a new Department Chair, who is also the PI of this grant, we have recently revised and updated our core curriculum that stresses 20 core competencies under the broad rubrics of foundational skills and applications proficiency. This curriculum review is also creating focus for our three training areas and the development of new training courses and experiences.      The Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Utah is in the process of growth and change with new leadership, and here we describe our training successes to date as well as our expanded scope of training for this new funding period.      Public Health Informatics has been defined as the study of systems for creating information and managing knowledge to understand, protect, and improve health in society. Our public health informatics program will train students in the development and application of technologies that will aid public health practitioners in these activities. We will train students to build tools that will assist educators, researchers, physicians, and individuals in the community to define and address public health issues.             n/a",University

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7209749,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2007,430160,0.11329829337308633
"REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a summer program for undergraduates with non-biological sciences backgrounds that will provide cross-discipline training and experiences in combining the physical sciences backgrounds of the participants with concepts and approaches of functional genomics and cell biology to address biomedical research problems. The intended impact of our program is to encourage participating students to pursue graduate education in biomedical sciences, followed by careers in biomedical research.       Six students will be selected each year to pursue 10-week research experiences in one of eleven laboratories at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Instruction in functional genomics and cell biology will be provided through workshops and a series of seminars. Students will work as a group on a cross-discipline case study in wound-healing. In addition, students will receive instruction in research ethics, scientific writing, and career opportunities in biomedical sciences. At the conclusion of the summer, students will present their work at a poster session and receive evaluations. Students will be encouraged to publish their results in the Journal of the Ohio Association of Science.  To build community among these students, they will participate in a series of social and cultural events.   Formative evaluations will be used to alter and fine-tune the Program, and summative evaluations will be carried out at the conclusion of each summer and again, as the participants graduate from their undergraduate institutions, to measure the long-term impact of the Program on the participating students. n/a",REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology,7226706,R25GM072834,"['Academia', 'Academy',

"Biomedical and Health Informatics Research Training Biomedical informatics spans a research space essential in a number of areas of life sciences and healthcare. The demand for well-trained research scientists in this area is exploding, although there is real need for independent research and informatics tool development, there is also an increasing emphasis on interdisciplinary research, where biomedical informaticians play a central role. We propose a combined pre- doctoral (6 positions) and post-doctoral (6 positions) research training program that prepares research fellows to become leaders in the academic and research biomedical informatics community and valuable contributors to interdisciplinary biomedical research problems. The goal of the biomedical informatics research training (BIRT) program at the University of Missouri- Columbia (MU) is to provide strong foundational training in informatics theory and methodology, build upon the fundamentals of biological and computational sciences, and prepare research fellows to assume leadership roles working on important problems in life scienes, healthcare, bioinformatics, and computational biology. MU has a strong history of biomedical informatics research training, but with implementaion of a recent planned expansion of informatics resources, our campus research community is now better positioned than ever before to be leaders in biomedical informatics research training and further strengthen life sciences and healthcare research. The creation of the MU Informatics Institute (MUM) brings together biomedical : informatics researchersfrom the campus, fully integrates faculty resources of 2 strong departments, Computer Science and Health Management and Informatics, and provides a structure for leveraging outstanding resources. The MUII will manage the PhD in Informatics program, as well as multidiscipliriary informatics research faculty and research trainees. n/a",Biomedical and Health Informatics Research

"21st-Century Imaging Sciences: Undergraduate and Graduate Student Training    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical to continued progress in imaging sciences is the integration of traditionally discrete lines of research. For example, advances in observing organelles and macromolecular complexes in living cells need to be integrated with new methodological approaches to imaging live animals; advances in biochemistry that produce novel imaging agents need to be integrated with new approaches to selective cellular delivery and employ transgenic animal models simulating human diseases. To realize the potential that evolving paradigms of molecular, cellular, live animal and human imaging offer, a cadre of 21st-century scientists must be trained-and a revolutionary synthesis of chemistry, biology, engineering, physics and mathematics must be achieved. The imaging science community at Washington University, because of its breadth, diversity and depth of funding, is in an excellent position to foster the development of a new approach by attracting and training next-generation imaging scientists. We propose to devise curricula and develop opportunities that reach out to students at the most formative stages of their academic careers-in their undergraduate and graduate years. Early access to students is imperative to develop a broadly-based academic foundation in both the physical and life sciences, and in engineering. An Undergraduate Imaging Sciences Pathway will be developed. Students in their junior and senior years will have the opportunity to take courses in chemistry, physics, computer science, engineering and molecular cell biology as they relate to imaging sciences, and to gain in-depth research experience in laboratories of imaging sciences faculty. For predoctoral students, we propose to create a Graduate Imaging Sciences Pathway that will be available to students in the biomedical sciences, physical and quantitative sciences, psychology, and engineering. We anticipate that the Graduate Pathway program will mature into a formal graduate program in 2008, when we have optimized the curriculum and developed the administrative mechanisms for interdisciplinary training of students having mentors in the Schools of Arts and Sciences, Medicine, and Engineering and Applied Sciences. We envision that a graduate student who has completed training in the Imaging Sciences Pathway or graduate program will be poised to broaden their horizons and open new opportunities for research in the new age of interdisciplinary science.

"Biomedical and Health Informatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI) research training program at the University of Washington has matured rapidly and successfully since its inception in 1999. UW offers a highly collaborative environment with a strong track record of interdisciplinary research initiatives, which has driven the culture and priorities of the UW BHI activities. At its core the UW program recognizes that a key characteristic of successful BHI researchers is the ability to play a leadership role in translating methods and models from the computing sciences, information sciences and behavioral sciences into tools and solutions for information related challenges and opportunities faced by care providers, patients, biomedical researchers, and public health providers. BHI researchers in this role develop new knowledge that advances the field of BHI. They can also advance knowledge in the underlying computing, information and behavioral science disciplines, as well as contributing to advancing our knowledge in the biomedical domain. The goal of the BHI program is therefore to train future research leaders in the field with translational skills and interdisciplinary expertise across the domains of bioinformatics, clinical informatics, and public health informatics. The UW training program consists of: a) a core curriculum of foundational concepts in the field that reach across the discipline, b) core   domain courses (clinical, biological, and public health), c) methodology courses (research methods,   pedagogy, and biostatistics), and d) individualized in depth electives in foundational and domain areas.   UW received its initial NLM-supported training grant in 2002; since then the BHI program has admitted four cohorts of students, including 27 NLM funded trainees, and graduated its first PhD student along with 15 research-focused MS students. Although relatively young, the training program has evolved significantly; processes for recruitment, admissions, mentoring, and optimizing trainee progress have been refined, as has the core curriculum. To maintain this success UW proposes to continue the NLM training program, seeking funding to support 18 trainees each year over the 2007-2012 cycle. This would permit recruitment of 4-5 new predoctoral trainees and 2 new post-doctoral trainees each year. As we continue to build our program we plan to continue to expand our interdisciplinary research collaborations in general with two strategic areas of focus in particular: a) leveraging UW strengths in Genome Sciences to further develop bioinformatics interdisciplinary collaborations, and b) leveraging UW history of excellence in clinical research by helping support a broad UW effort to establish

"NLM Training Program in Biomedical Informatics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For almost two decades, the W. M. Keck Center, which spans six biomedical institutions in the Greater   Houston, Texas area, has trained pre- and postdoctoral fellows in biomedical informatics. Here we seek the renewal of one of our training programs (the NLMTP), which the National Library of Medicine has supported for fifteen years. When we began the NLMTP, we foresaw that computational biology would reshape medicine in important ways, and so emphasized this emerging discipline in the research experiences our trainees. Now that computational biology has a firmly established place in biomedicine, in the NLMTP renewal, we will emphasize clinical informatics more heavily and broaden our focus to include translational medicine, public health, biosecurity, applied nanotechnology and computational biomedical engineering. In the NLMTP, we will exploit the Keck Center's considerable strengths in simulation and imaging, statistical and computational biomedicine, clinical decision-making and deep expertise regarding biological structure and function. And we will employ processes for recruiting, selecting, monitoring and assessing trainees that have proved so successful in the Keck Center over the years.             n/a",NLM Training Program in

"Integrated Interdisciplinary Training in Computational Neuroscience    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an interdisciplinary program at the University of Pennsylvania to train outstanding undergraduate and predoctoral students in computational neuroscience. Penn offers unique strengths in basic and clinical neuroscience, both integrated with computational approaches. All participating departments at Penn are national leaders in their field, have a long history of research and educational collaborations, and are located in close proximity on a single campus. The undergraduate and graduate student populations are highly qualified. Twenty-four faculty at Penn, plus faculty at six nearby regional institutions are involved, including experimentalists, modelers, and many faculty with expertise in both domains. The preceptors have extensive experience in education and research training in computational neuroscience. The program consists of three components: an undergraduate research training program, a summer research program for undergraduates, and a predoctoral training program. The focus is on directly integrating Neuroscience and quantitative studies through course work and extensive research training. Students will carry out integrated experimental/modeling research projects directed at computational problems. The structure and strategy of our program is designed to have each student individually achieve a significant research contribution through the integrated development of model, experiment, and data analysis. We propose to develop an integrated undergraduate curriculum in computational neuroscience including a new, keystone course, and to significantly update and expand our current graduate courses in computational neuroscience-all including substantial laboratory components. We will also introduce a dedicated seminar series, separate undergraduate and graduate journal clubs, an annual retreat, and other programmatic activities. A distinguishing focus of our program is on application of computational neuroscience to neurological and psychiatric disorders. Students will undertake clinical rotations, analyze clinically obtained data, and have the option of rotations on computational projects in Penn's clinically-directed research centers. A summer research program will be developed, which will attract undergraduates primarily from the Philadelphia region. Six nearby universities are participating in this summer program, including Swarthmore, Drexel, Temple, Haverford, Bryn Mawr, and Lincoln Universities. The summer program will be designed to engage and excite students to pursue graduate work in computational neuroscience. The student population will include a significant proportion of women and underrepresented minorities.           n/a",Integrated Interdisciplinary Training in Computational

"Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to PAR-03-034 ""Neuroinformatics Institutional Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K12)."" The overarching goal of this application is to provide an excellent postdoctoral training program in neuroimaging neuroinformatics that capitalizes on the many strengths of the existing neuroscientists, informatics and imaging resources that our combined resources represent. Our proposed Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program (NNTP) is based upon a number of important strategic alliances. The first cornerstone of this effort is the existing HBP grants held by Dr. Anders Dale (R01 NS39581: Cortical-Surface-Based Brain Imaging) and Dr. David Kennedy (R01 NS34189: Anatomic Morphologic Analysis of MR Brain Images). These efforts span a wealth of technological developments, research and clinical application areas in the rapidly developing area of quantitative morphometric image analysis. A second and vital cornerstone is our association with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Biomedical Informatics Program. This existing pre- and post-graduate academic program, within a world class biomedical engineering department, is an ideal setting for the development of a coordinated training effort in Neuroinformatics. The established track record in training skilled scientists in areas of informatics will prove invaluable in this new initiative. The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees. A plan for recruiting, selecting and monitoring trainees is proposed. This program will be an asset to the Neuroinformatics initiatives of the Human Brain Project by helping to prepare future scientists with advanced neuroinformatics skills         n/a",Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program,7056141,K12MH069281,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain morphology', 'career', 'image processing', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurosciences', 'training']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K12,2006,439784,0.12284290817640765
"Doctoral Training in Bioinformatics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomics is revolutionizing research in evolution, developmental biology and, more generally, in the molecular biology of the cell in normal and pathological states. It promises to revolutionize medicine by the development of new diagnostics based on molecular fingerprints, the identification of drug targets, and individualized medicine. The revolution rests on high throughput experimental methods, closely associated high throughput computational methods--machine learning algorithms, mathematical statistics and the like---and modem information technologies that permit easy many to many communication between thousands of users. Our Ph.D. Program in Bioinformatics is currently directed at training two different groups: researchers who will become professionals in the field; i.e. who will move it forward by the development of new methods required for creative experimental research; and biomedical researchers who will be users of the technologies. Because computation and experiment are tightly coupled, all students in the Program must have hands on experience at the bench in addition to intensive training in computational methods. In recognition of the profound effect these technologies are likely to have on the social fabric, all students are required to take a core, full-credit course on legal and ethical implications of genomics.             n/a",Doctoral Training in Bioinformatics,7061217,T32GM070409,[' '],NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,T32,2006,178071,0.06192845560799187
"Visual Cognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The training program in Visual Cognition is based on the beliefs that vision is central to the understanding of the mind, and that it can now only be studied in a way that integrates knowledge and methods from many traditional disciplines (cognitive psychology, psychophysics, neuroscience, neuropsychology, computer vision). This requires new generations of scientists whose training encompasses all these disciplines.

Now is a crucial time for the renewal of this training grant because of the great expansion in vision research we expect in our department over the next few years, resulting from the increased access to brain imaging equipment at the new MIT-MGH Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, and from the numerous new hires expected in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research (of which the PI is a member), several of whom are likely to work on high-level vision.         n/a",Visual Cognition,7101911,T32MH020007,[' '],NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,T32,2006,146743,0.09081376727533433
"Biomedical and Health Informatics Research Training  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Competing Continuation proposal for ""biomedical and health informatics"" (B&HI) brings together faculty and students in four universities and five major academic teaching hospitals in the Boston area. Since our previous renewal five years ago, B&HI is becoming an increasingly mainstream aspect of our academic medical centers, pervading most aspects of (a) research, across a wide spectrum from molecular/genomic to population-based studies; (b) clinical practice, and education. Moreover, research, practice, and education are all becoming large, distributed, even ""virtual"" enterprises, as a result of which their management requires attention to infrastructure and enabling technologies. A number of broad development initiatives in the Boston area are now bringing B&HI specialists and domain experts together - in bioinformatics, educational technology, image-based systems, shared information repositories, knowledge-based clinical practice, machine learning, consumer health, and other areas. We have experienced a dramatic growth in faculty and students active in B&HI. Primary B&HI faculty and research have more than doubled since our combined training program began 10 years ago. We have been very successful in recruiting bright, creative, and energetic trainees. Many of our former trainees have gone on to academic or health information system leadership positions throughout the United States. This proposal seeks to build on our experience and on the various new initiatives, to provide a multi-faceted, coordinated, training program to prepare B&HI professionals for successful careers in this field. The program is administered through the joint Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST), which provides an academic home for B&HI, the ability to make primary and secondary faculty appointments, cross-registration of courses, and two degree programs in B&HI. Three other degree programs are also available to trainees. Trainees typically have dual appointments in HST and in one of seven primary informatics research and development units, based at Harvard, MIT, or at teaching hospitals. Collaborative projects involve a number of other participating entities.

"TRAINING IN VISION RESEARCH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Support is requested for four additional fellows in the longstanding fellowship training program at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute. Although the program has been successful in training dozens of research fellows in visual processing and scores of clinical ophthalmology fellows over the past three decades, it falls far short of the needs of the current faculty of eighteen investigators. The current program funding can support postdoctoral fellows to work with only about a quarter of the investigators. The need for fellows is particularly critical at Smith-Kettlewell, an independent institute devoted purely to research, for two reasons: 1) they bring fresh ideas and energy to established laboratories during their training and 2) they learn to conduct projects independently with minor oversight from their mentors. Conversely, the established investigators are in an excellent position to offer high quality training to fellows because they are fulltime researchers without teaching responsibilities in the traditional university setting. The goal of the application is therefore to approximately double the scale of the fellowship training program at Smith-Kettlewell.   The areas of expertise are spatial vision, infant vision (normal and abnormal), subcortical processing retinal processing and its disorders, strabismus and amblyopia, eye movement control, eye muscle physiology, visual rehabilitation, computational neuroscience, sensory impairment, stereopsis, motion, cortical processing, and computer vision. Smith-Kettlewell investigators make a substantial contribution to the national research effort in ophthalmology and visual disorders, with most of the faculty serving on NIH, NSF or NIDDR scientific review panels, all faculty qualifying to receive federal funding for their research, and many members serving on editorial boards and as officers of professional organizations who have oversight for programming meetings in the discipline.   The current fellowship program is already fully coordinated with the NEI requirements for INRSA postdoctoral programs, including a didactic component, ethics training and stipend levels. Integration of the INRSA component of the program with the current other support will therefore require no further adjustments. The INRSA component will fund exclusively fellows with U.S. residency certification while the other institutional components will fund both the remaining U.S. and non-U.S. fellows on an equal basis. n/a",TRAINING IN VISION RESEARCH,7123834,T32EY014536,[' '],NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,T32,2006,188306,0.05939613119436898
"Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Precollege science education, particularly middle school where students first encounter courses dedicated to the sciences, has lacked the attention of the scientific and education communities. As a result, many middle level teachers are marginally prepared to teach contemporary science, the development of effective curricular materials has lagged, and schools devote inadequate resources and support to science. In the prior Phase I grant, experiment modules have been designed by scientists that address the core content of middle school Life Science. They utilize live (aquatic) organisms in the class room to stimulate inquiry into the properties of living organisms and make connections with related environmental health problems to link student learning with the world around them. Human environmental health was chosen as the biomedical context because it strongly relates to the macroscopic world in which middle school students live and provides age-appropriate learning opportunities for students as they begin to understand organisms and their underlying structures and mechanisms. During Phase II our specific objectives are 1. To infuse middle school Life Science education with attractive experiment modules that stress student inquiry. 2. To mount a comprehensive dissemination program with school systems that work with large numbers of minorities and students from families with lower socioeconomic status. 3. To utilize a 'train the trainer' method for lead teachers to achieve wide dissemination of the modules that involves close collaboration between scientists and educators and the lead teachers. 4. To provide teachers with full support to implement and sustain the modules through a science resource center. 5. To continue the development of the content of the modules. 6. To obtain a thorough formative and summative evaluation of the effectiveness of the curriculum modules and the entire mechanism for their delivery. 7. To establish a robust program to sustain the module dissemination to teachers after the completion of the grant.         n/a",Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII,6857683,R25RR014267,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'artificial intelligence', 'curriculum', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'ethnic group', 'female', 'learning', 'meeting /conference /symposium', 'minority health professional', 'science education', 'secondary schools', 'social support network', 'teacher', 'university student', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R25,2005,268813,0.04746409201127021
"Integrative Neuronal Systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests renewal of their major training grant. The department is organized to promote interdisciplinary training and basic research in neuroscience and behavior, approached with the experimental power of modern cellular and molecular biology and of systems neuroscience and cognitive science, combined with the theoretical strength of computational methods coming from the field of artificial intelligence. Trainees begin laboratory work under one or more advisors through lab rotations in the first term and subsequently joining a laboratory, working on problems in learning and memory, neural development, vision, or motor control. Required coursework can be completed in two to three years, with a two-term sequence of core courses in the first year and a flexible array of graduate lecture courses, seminars, and guided reading. Oral and written reports to the faculty and at professional meetings and in journals mark the students' progress through completion of a thesis, which is usually based on the second major project, begun in the third year. Most students continue in research careers, armed with skills in more than one of the disciplines of cellular and molecular neuroscience, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, neuropsychology, psychophysics, and computational neuroscience. Trainees will, in general, have strong backgrounds in the natural sciences (e.g., undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, physics, or electrical engineering). Occasional trainees will already hold a graduate degree in another field.

"Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to PAR-03-034 ""Neuroinformatics Institutional Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K12)."" The overarching goal of this application is to provide an excellent postdoctoral training program in neuroimaging neuroinformatics that capitalizes on the many strengths of the existing neuroscientists, informatics and imaging resources that our combined resources represent. Our proposed Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program (NNTP) is based upon a number of important strategic alliances. The first cornerstone of this effort is the existing HBP grants held by Dr. Anders Dale (R01 NS39581: Cortical-Surface-Based Brain Imaging) and Dr. David Kennedy (R01 NS34189: Anatomic Morphologic Analysis of MR Brain Images). These efforts span a wealth of technological developments, research and clinical application areas in the rapidly developing area of quantitative morphometric image analysis. A second and vital cornerstone is our association with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Biomedical Informatics Program. This existing pre- and post-graduate academic program, within a world class biomedical engineering department, is an ideal setting for the development of a coordinated training effort in Neuroinformatics. The established track record in training skilled scientists in areas of informatics will prove invaluable in this new initiative. The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees.

It promises to revolutionize medicine by the development of new diagnostics based on molecular fingerprints, the identification of drug targets, and individualized medicine. The revolution rests on high throughput experimental methods, closely associated high throughput computational methods--machine learning algorithms, mathematical statistics and the like---and modem information technologies that permit easy many to many communication between thousands of users. Our Ph.D. Program in Bioinformatics is currently directed at training two different groups: researchers who will become professionals in the field; i.e. who will move it forward by the development of new methods required for creative experimental research; and biomedical researchers who will be users of the technologies. Because computation and experiment are tightly coupled, all students in the Program must have hands on experience at the bench in addition to intensive training in computational methods.

"UNC Predoc Training Progr in Bioinformatics/Comp Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies call for a new generation of scientists equipped to extract knowledge from large biological datasets and develop and apply novel data analytical, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques. The Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) was established at UNC-Chapel Hill in the Fall 2002 to address these needs. The Program is administered by the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences (CCGS), which was formed in August 2001 with a mission of conducting basic and applied research in all areas related to genome sciences. Twelve BCB faculty members have been recruited by UNC-CH in the last two years, with specialties in evolutionary genetics, information science, proteome analysis, protein folding, statistical genetics, and mathematical biology. In total, 39 computational and experimental genomics faculty distributed among 16 departments and schools are affiliated as BCB mentors. The program consists of four key components: a colloquium, research rotations, formal coursework, and PhD research. The coursework is designed to include three tiers of formal training: prerequisite, core, and advanced courses. Eight specialized core modules have been developed for the BCB program that cover major related areas such as information theory, machine learning, sequence comparison, phylogeny, data management, ontology, data mining, biostatistics, biomolecular structure/function prediction, and modeling of complex systems. Funds are requested to support six predoctoral students for two years each. Matching support from several local industrial organizations has been committed to allow additional student support and/or industrial internships. The students will pursue PhD degrees in participating UNC-CH Departments with a common emphasis on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; future plans include transitioning into independent Phi3 granting curriculum. The requested funds will dovetail with the UNC investment in research infrastructure, faculty recruitment, and education in both genomics and bioinformatics, leveraging intramural as well as extramural industrial support to expand this vital interdisciplinary training program. n/a",UNC Predoc Training Progr in Bioinformatics/Comp Biology,6801340,T32GM067553,[' '],NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,T32,2005,112118,0.11580165954931625

"Integrative Neuronal Systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests renewal of their major training grant. The department is organized to promote interdisciplinary training and basic research in neuroscience and behavior, approached with the experimental power of modern cellular and molecular biology and of systems neuroscience and cognitive science, combined with the theoretical strength of computational methods coming from the field of artificial intelligence. Trainees begin laboratory work under one or more advisors through lab rotations in the first term and subsequently joining a laboratory, working on problems in learning and memory, neural development, vision, or motor control. Required coursework can be completed in two to three years, with a two-term sequence of core courses in the first year and a flexible array of graduate lecture courses, seminars, and guided reading. Oral and written reports to the faculty and at professional meetings and in journals mark the students' progress through completion of a thesis, which is usually based on the second major project, begun in the third year. Most students continue in research careers, armed with skills in more than one of the disciplines of cellular and molecular neuroscience, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, neuropsychology, psychophysics, and computational neuroscience. Trainees will, in general, have strong backgrounds in the natural sciences (e.g., undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, physics, or electrical engineering). Occasional trainees will already hold a graduate degree in another field.

"TRAINING GRANT IN MOLECULAR BIOPHYSICS Funding is requested for continued support of an interdisciplinary training program in molecular biophysics at Rutgers University. The program offers broad exposure to the experimental and theoretical techniques needed to solve problems in molecular biophysics together with in-depth training with a specific research problem. The graduate faculty of Rutgers University includes one of the largest and most active groups of molecular biophysicists in the country with interests ranging from molecular and submolecular problems to aspects of cellular organization and intact organisms. The training faculty are spread over four graduate programs at Rutgers and seven departments at Rutgers and the adjacent Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (formerly Rutgers Medical School) of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. There are significant research programs in X-ray crystallography and diffraction (Edward Arnold, Helen M. Berman, Barbara M. Brodsky, Millie M.

"Visual Cognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The training program in Visual Cognition is based on the beliefs that vision is central to the understanding of the mind, and that it can now only be studied in a way that integrates knowledge and methods from many traditional disciplines (cognitive psychology, psychophysics, neuroscience, neuropsychology, computer vision). This requires new generations of scientists whose training encompasses all these disciplines. MIT is a perfect site for such a program because of its long history of accomplishments in vision science (both research and training), the unusual composition of the department (experimental psychology, computation, and neuroscience), and its experience and infrastructure for an interdisciplinary training program contributed by the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. The program has provided predoctoral students with core courses in cognitive science and neuroscience, extensive research experience, oral and written qualifying exams, lecture courses and research seminars, experience and training in undergraduate teaching, close oversight of progress, repeated oral presentations, and immersion in a peer culture of students and fellows interested in visual cognition. Now is a crucial time for the renewal of this training grant because of the great expansion in vision research we expect in our department over the next few years, resulting from the increased access to brain imaging equipment at the new MIT-MGH Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, and from the numerous new hires expected in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research (of which the PI is a member), several of whom are likely to work on high-level vision.         n/a",Visual Cognition,6593311,T32MH020007,[' '],NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,T32,2003,149125,0.09081376727533433
"Biomedical and Health Informatics Research Training  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Competing Continuation proposal for ""biomedical and health informatics"" (B&HI) brings together faculty and students in four universities and five major academic teaching hospitals in the Boston area. Since our previous renewal five years ago, B&HI is becoming an increasingly mainstream aspect of our academic medical centers, pervading most aspects of (a) research, across a wide spectrum from molecular/genomic to population-based studies; (b) clinical practice, and education. Moreover, research, practice, and education are all becoming large, distributed, even ""virtual"" enterprises, as a result of which their management requires attention to infrastructure and enabling technologies. A number of broad development initiatives in the Boston area are now bringing B&HI specialists and domain experts together - in bioinformatics, educational technology, image-based systems, shared information repositories, knowledge-based clinical practice, machine learning, consumer health, and other areas. We have experienced a dramatic growth in faculty and students active in B&HI. Primary B&HI faculty and research have more than doubled since our combined training program began 10 years ago. We have been very successful in recruiting bright, creative, and energetic trainees. Many of our former trainees have gone on to academic or health information system leadership positions throughout the United States. This proposal seeks to build on our experience and on the various new initiatives, to provide a multi-faceted, coordinated, training program to prepare B&HI professionals for successful careers in this field. The program is administered through the joint Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST), which provides an academic home for B&HI, the ability to make primary and secondary faculty appointments, cross-registration of courses, and two degree programs in B&HI. Three other degree programs are also available to trainees. Trainees typically have dual appointments in HST and in one of seven primary informatics research and development units, based at Harvard, MIT, or at teaching hospitals. Collaborative projects involve a number of other participating entities.

"TRAINING IN VISION RESEARCH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Support is requested for four additional fellows in the longstanding fellowship training program at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute. Although the program has been successful in training dozens of research fellows in visual processing and scores of clinical ophthalmology fellows over the past three decades, it falls far short of the needs of the current faculty of eighteen investigators. The current program funding can support postdoctoral fellows to work with only about a quarter of the investigators. The need for fellows is particularly critical at Smith-Kettlewell, an independent institute devoted purely to research, for two reasons: 1) they bring fresh ideas and energy to established laboratories during their training and 2) they learn to conduct projects independently with minor oversight from their mentors. Conversely, the established investigators are in an excellent position to offer high quality training to fellows because they are fulltime researchers without teaching responsibilities in the traditional university setting. The goal of the application is therefore to approximately double the scale of the fellowship training program at Smith-Kettlewell.   The areas of expertise are spatial vision, infant vision (normal and abnormal), subcortical processing retinal processing and its disorders, strabismus and amblyopia, eye movement control, eye muscle physiology, visual rehabilitation, computational neuroscience, sensory impairment, stereopsis, motion, cortical processing, and computer vision.

"Educational Tools for Neuroscience   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SHAI proposes to bring two instructional        technologies together to compliment neuroscience lectures and distance               learning. Specifically we want to embed Computer Simulations of experiments and      the chemical, genetic, and physiological systems that underlie them within an        Intelligent Tutoring System. Simulations are excellent tools for revealing the       structure and dynamics of systems to students. They can also serve as a basis        of interactive experiments where students can ""discover"" the answers to              questions. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are an emerging educational            technology based on artificial intelligence research. They play the role of          tutor, in that they guide students with appropriate information or                   demonstrations when they are having difficulty with a lesson. They also              adaptively plan the presentation of new lessons based on evaluations of a            student's past performance and knowledge level. The objective of this phase I        proposal is to develop a prototype of NeuroTutor, a simulation-based ITS to          provide students with individualized instruction in a simulation centered            environment. Steps to reaching this objective include designing a curriculum,        developing instructional, presentations and support, developing appropriate          methods for Student Modeling and Diagnosis, and implementing a limited               prototype.

"ANALYZING HUMAN ABILITIES The Purpose of this program is to train graduate students for research in cognition, with special attention to analysis of skills in perception, learning, memory, judgment, language, reasoning, problem solving, and decision making. Trainees will be predoctoral students working towards a Ph.D. in psychology. Through formal courses, specialized seminars, and apprenticeship research, students are trained in past and current work in experimental cognitive psychology, theoretical advances, and new developments in experimentation. The training program generally requires four years beyond the Bachelors degree, and follows the requirements of the Ph.D. program of the Psychology Department. From the beginning, students work closely with one or more faculty members, to select a set of courses and develop a research program best suited to their scientific interests and goals. In-depth survey courses in sub-areas of cognitive psychology are supplemented with state-of-the-art seminars and complemented by courses in related areas, such as neuroscience, linguistics, education, human factors, and artificial intelligence. Students also have opportunities for applied research in laboratories within the University and nearby research institutes with which we have close affiliations.  Funds are requested for six (6) full time predoctoral trainees per year. Approximately 85 students apply each year for admission to the cognitive program; we normally enroll 5 or 6, selected for their outstanding promise for a productive career. Many of our graduates take academic positions in teaching and research but a significant number elect positions in applied settings, in research or development of products designed to supplement or increase human effectiveness in perception, learning, memory, reasoning, and decision making.  n/a",ANALYZING HUMAN ABILITIES,6391853,T32MH015157,[' '],NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,T32,2001,92389,0.11460117860893575

"VISUAL COGNITION The Center for Cognitive Neuroscience in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT proposes to create a research training program in Visual Cognition. The program is based on the beliefs that vision is central to the understanding of the mind, and that it now can only be studied in a way that integrates knowledge and methods from many traditional disciplines (cognitive psychology, psychophysics, neuroscience, neuropsychology, Computer vision). This requires new generations of scientists whose training encompasses all these disciplines. MIT is an especially suitable site for such a program because of its long history of accomplishments in vision science (both research and training), the unusual composition of the department (experimental psychology, computation, and neuroscience), and the existence of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, which provides the experience and infrastructure for an interdisciplinary training program. The program would provide six predoctoral and two postdoctoral students with core courses in cognitive science and neuroscience, foundational courses in vision, visual cognition, and computation, early and extensive research experience, the guidance of two advisors (in two different areas among the three constituting the department), oral and written qualifying exams, research seminars, experience and training in undergraduate teaching, close oversight of progress, repeated oral presentations, and immersion in a peer culture of students and fellows interested in visual cognition.  n/a",VISUAL COGNITION,6391588,T32MH020007,[' '],NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,T32,2001,124253,0.08007966001532109

"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology and cognition PROGRAM SUMMARY The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU's unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook's AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program.

"NINR Intramural Research Training Programs NINR training programs include the Summer Genetics Institute, Methodologies Boot Camps (Pain; Fatigue and Sleep; Big Data in Symptoms Research; Precision Health: from Omics to Data Science; Precision Health: Smart Technologies, Smart Health, Artificial Intelligence), pre- and postdoctoral fellowships, and other Institute-sponsored intramural research and training opportunities.    1. Summer Genetics Institute (SGI) Program  The 2020 SGI program was canceled to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus. Despite canceling the month-long program, NINR's Division of Intramural Research (DIR) held a virtual symposium to mark a milestone anniversary  celebrating 20 years. The symposium titled Omics to Advance Symptom Science Research was held on June 22 and examined how omics methodologies are improving symptom measurement and characterization and explored how this research is guiding approaches to biobehavioral interventional methods.   Acting NINR director Dr. Tara Schwetz opened the symposium and provided a brief background of the SGI, citing the programs goal since its inception. NIH director Dr. Francis Collins delivered opening remarks, highlighting the importance of genomics in nursing and the important role of nurses in contributing significantly to reshaping and optimizing healthcare  by accelerating integration of genomics into healthcare. Dr. Christine Miaskowski discussed the use of omics to understand oncology patient symptoms and touched on the importance of genetics and genomics in nursing research as a catalyst for risk factor identification. Dr. Yvette Conley reviewed using omics to understand outcomes after neurological injury, and Dr. Angela Starkweather  described the genomics of the transition from acute to chronic pain. The speakers also discussed their involvement with SGI, their career trajectories and perspectives on the future of omics in translational programs of research and clinical care. Acting Scientific Director Dr. Terri Armstrong closed the symposium and highlighted key papers that have helped build the framework for genomic nursing research and competencies and looked to the future. She described a paradigm shift where approaches used in nursing and medicine are now interconnected. Genomic research can be used to study both the human response--a nursing approach--with the association with disease--an approach used in medicine.  About 1100 people joined the event live, and over 250 have viewed on-demand. In total participants represent 20 countries outside the US. CEUs were awarded and available until 1 week following the event.   The event page is listed here. https://www.ninr.nih.gov/newsandinformation/events/sgi-20  The symposium is archived at the following link. https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=37511   2. Symptom Methodologies Boot Camp. 2020 Artificial Intelligence  The 2020 Boot Camp explored the impact that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has in the evolving healthcare environment, and overall efforts to improve the quality of care for patients and families. This was the first time that a boot camp was held online only. The goal is to enable attendees to understand basic principles of AI and how clinicians can form strategic alliances with data scientists to carry out research on data-driven intelligent hardware and software approaches to health-related issues. It took place from August 3-6, 2020 for 2 hours each day.  The 2020 Boot Camp had four sessions to focus on a particular theme. On the first day Innovations and Improvements in Health Outcomes introduced the role that AI has in promoting new ways or processes to apply AI in healthcare and incorporating fundamental approaches into AI projects. On the second day Clinical Applications explored the involvement of AI algorithms in clinical decision support and how AI and apps addressed health disparities and increased participant and community engagement. The afternoon demo showed how to use software for natural language processing and nursing notes. The third day Ethical, Legal and Social Implications covered moral and ethical issues in AI, managing and minimizing bias, and transparency using AI. The last day Collaborative Science described integrating AI across teams and leveraging partnerships across NIH for the research community. The afternoon session described an app that monitors resilience within a community.  The event generated great interest from across the country and internationally. On the first day over 1300 people joined from nearly 30 countries outside the US, and attendance was high every day. Because this was a virtual event and not limited by the number of physical seats, we were able to accommodate about 10 times the number of participants.   The event was broadcast live via NIH Videocast and archived for later viewing.  https://www.ninr.nih.gov/newsandinformation/events/bootcamp2020#sessioni  Day 1: https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=36182 Day 2: https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=36186 Day 3: https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=36190 Day 4: https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=36194    3. Graduate Partnership Program (GPP)  The NINR GPP is part of the NIH intramural Graduate Partnership Program and was begun as a 3-year pilot program in the fall of 2003. The first NINR GPP fellow was accepted in the spring of 2004. In total for FY 2020, our program supported 3 graduate students from University of Nebraska Medical Center, University of Missouri at St. Louis, and University of Illinois at Chicago. Of these three, two students have recently successfully defended the dissertation. Applications are accepted via an online application system beginning in August and ending in December each year.   4. New Postbaccalaureate IRTA fellow trainees in the DIR of NINR  Six new postbaccalaureate fellows were accepted this past year. Of those who have completed their training, 30% entered medical school, 30% entered PhD in neuroscience programs, 15% entered physical therapy school, 15% entered combined MD-PhD programs, and the remainder have entered the professional workforce.   5. New Postdoctoral trainees in the DIR of NINR  Three new postdoctoral fellows were accepted this past year, and one has completed their postdoctoral fellowship at NINR and decided to continue training.     6. NINR Summer Internship Program  The 2020 Summer Internship Program was also canceled. Despite the cancellation of the onsite internship program, NINR hosted a virtual panel session titled Careers in Nursing Science that was held on Friday, July 10, 2020 from 2-3 pm ET.  The purpose was to highlight careers as a scientist and a nurse with the NINR. Participants learned about the many career opportunities open to nurses with PhDs and how nurses ask research questions, which are person-centered and patient focused.  Over 200 people participated from 34 US states and from 3 countries outside the US. The panelists were Dr. Patricia Brennan, RN, PhD, Director, National Library of Medicine; Dr. Leorey Saligan, PhD, RN, CRNP, FAAN, Acting Chief, Symptom Science Center; Dr. Paule V.

"Institutional Training Grant in Genomic Science Project Summary Abstract This proposal is for a renewal of NIH funding for Washington University’s Genome Analysis Training Program (GATP). The overall goal of the GATP is to train a diverse group of multidisciplinary, quantitatively sophisticated leaders in genomic technology, science, and medicine. In this renewal, we are focusing exclusively on training predoctoral students, because Washington University has an outstanding pool of highly talented PhD and MD/PhD students from which we can recruit the very best for the GATP. We are requesting funds to support 8 predoctoral trainees. If we are granted these slots the university will provide matching funds to support an additional 4 trainees. The GATP is designed to produce trainees who are sophisticated in their knowledge of both the experimental and the mathematical / computational aspects of genome science. This is achieved through a rigorous set of required classes and through research-based training. We have an outstanding group of 37 training faculty who run world-class research labs and provide careful mentoring to our trainees. Our PhD programs in Computational Biology and Genetics/Genomics were jointly ranked #1 in the nation in the 2018 US News & World Report analysis, tied with MIT and Stanford. We have made significant changes to our training program based on feedback from our trainees. Our trainees consistently express an interest in learning about career paths that utilize their skills. In response we have designed a set of mini-internship programs that take advantage of our connections to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and to clinical genomics services. The opportunities are aimed at cultivating the leadership capability of our trainees and fostering a broad understanding of the different work environments and career paths in which genomics plays an important role. Many of our trainees are also interested in how machine learning is applied to problems in the genome sciences. As such we made changes to the GATP that ensure that all trainees are exposed to the foundational concepts underlying machine learning and artificial intelligence. We have also made changes to our evaluation protocols to make sure that we are meeting our goals in a way that is responsive to our trainees. Project Narrative Genome science refers to high-throughput, technology intensive, and computational approaches to understanding how variation in the human genome translates into phenotypic differences between individuals. The proposed program will train PhD and MD/PhD students to drive innovation in genome science and to apply their discoveries to improving patient outcomes.",Institutional Training Grant in Genomic Science,9934364,T32HG000045,"['Grant', 'Training', 'genome sciences']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,T32,2020,491776,0.1202545538848261

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems.

"Comprehensive Training program in Imaging Science and Informatics 7. Project Summary/Abstract The over-arching theme of this proposal is to train “comprehensive imaging scientists” in the skills necessary to identify clinically relevant problems; develop instrumentation, sensors, and contrast agents to form images appropriate for the problem; and analyze the resulting imaging data using signal processing, mathematical modeling, visualization, and informatics techniques to improve the prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases. The program spans from molecular to cellular to tissue to organ. In order for imaging scientists to be knowledgeable of the full trajectory from image formation to analysis and decision-making, they must be trained in four core areas: Instrumentation, Devices, and Contrast Agents; Image processing; Modeling and Visualization; and Data Mining and Informatics. All students in the program are trained in the core concepts of these areas. The current training program is a two-year pre-doctoral portfolio program. A total of 41 students have been admitted to the program. The proposed renewal will train another 20 students. The program includes off-campus externship research experiences; in-depth clinical engagement; and a wide-ranging professional development component. Imaging Science is an integral element of basic science research and clinical medicine. Imaging cell trafficking and receptor pharmacology in vivo have already led to targeted drug and gene therapies and an understanding of cellular biochemical pathways will contribute to new advances in medicine. Individualized medicine relies heavily on imaging techniques to select the best therapies and monitor progress. Although structural in situ human imaging is already a critical component of clinical medicine, many advances are needed in functional imaging of the brain and other organs to improve healthcare. Brain mapping which is a core focus of NIH research relies heavily on imaging. We have identified a critical need for imaging scientists to develop new imaging instrumentation and apply that instrumentation with appropriate methods from image processing; modeling and visualization; and informatics and data mining. In recognition of the potential of artificial intelligence to transform medical imaging, our program emphasizes applications of machine learning. This training program fills a critical niche by providing highly skilled scientists who are trained in the broad trajectory of imaging science. Understanding the interplay between instrumentation and image analysis, including machine learning methods, is important for designing the next generation of hardware and software tools for quantifying complex biological systems and providing robust clinical tools. A key outcome of the program is that trainees gain the skills necessary to identify clinically relevant problems. 8. Project Narrative The over-arching theme of this program is to train “comprehensive imaging scientists” in the skills necessary to identify clinically relevant problems and develop techniques to improve the prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases. Trainees learn the full trajectory of medical imaging, including the application of machine learning methods, and emphasis is placed on experiential learning in clinical environments.

"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9889974,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2020,575531,0.06666066649484644

"Stanford Health Services Research Training Program Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of Stanford's proposed Health Services Research Training Program (HSRTP) is to develop independent, well-trained, diverse researchers who conduct rigorous and innovative health services research (HSR) on important challenges facing the U.S. health care system. Our program design is motivated by our view that excellent health services researchers need a strong grasp of core disciplinary skills, the ability to function in multidisciplinary settings, and the ability to engage with both traditional and emerging research contexts. Accordingly, our program emphasizes strong disciplinary training in our core areas of health economics, outcomes research, and decision science. We provide this training within the rich multidisciplinary environment of our integrated campus. Our trainees will frequently be side-by-side with trainees and faculty from areas like clinical medicine, economics, engineering, ethics, informatics, and law.  Mentored research experiences are designed to further our program design goals. Trainees will pursue one or more independent research projects in their area(s) of interest, working with multiple mentors with complementary areas of expertise. The program will connect trainees with mentors focused on trainees' topics and methods of interest as well as at least one mentor focused on career development. The program includes 30 faculty mentors, drawn from 12 departments or programs. Trainees will find opportunities to engage in research projects in a wide variety of HSR areas, including AHRQ priority areas like health insurance, quality and safety, affordability, and access. As they pursue their research, our program will particularly facilitate engagement with emerging HSR topics, settings, and methods. Our program includes faculty and other connections to Stanford's strong and expanding capabilities in the areas of population health management, learning health care systems, informatics, and health law.

"Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of newly emerging computational tools for data science, biostatisticians need to play a fundamental role in health sciences research. There is an urgent need to encourage US Citizens and Permanent Residents to pursue graduate training in biostatistics. The design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials and observational studies; the setting of regulatory policy; and the conception of laboratory experiments have been shaped by the fundamental contributions of biostatisticians for decades. Advances in genomics, medical imaging technologies, and computational biology; the increasing emphasis on precision and evidence-based medicine; and the widespread adoption of electronic health records; demand the skills of biostatisticians trained to collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary environment and to develop statistical and machine learning methods to address the challenges presented by this data-rich revolutionary era of health sciences research. The proposed summer program which includes world-renowned clinical scientists and biostatisticians from two local universities, will provide an immense opportunity for student participants to learn basic yet modern statistical methods that are critical to uncovering new insights from such big and complex biomedical data and also illustrate the potential pitfalls of confounding and bias that may arise when analyzing biomedical data. A unique feature of the proposed training program is thus to expose the participants to not only basic statistical methods but also to the topics of computer science and bioinformatics which will be invaluable in creating the multidisciplinary teams required to tackle the complex research questions that often requires multipronged approaches. The proposed six-week training program will be structured around the NIH's Translation Science Spectrum and will introduce participants to opportunities in biostatistics through the lens of the science advanced by the contributions of biostatisticians. Following an initial set of weeks on basic training of biostatistical methods, the program will culminate in a data hack-a-thon style competition in which participants will employ the statistical and scientific knowledge gained during the program to produce the most innovative, statistically-sound, scientifically-relevant and effectively-communicated response to a set of research questions. The proposed research education program will enroll up to 20 such participants from across the nation and, through lectures, field trips, and opportunities to analyze data from real health sciences, inspire them to pursue graduate training. The program will draw upon considerable past collaborations and complementary resources of two local world-renowned universities to provide participants with an unparalleled view of the field, including award-winning instructors, internationally known methodological and clinical researchers, and a local area rich in opportunities to showcase careers in biostatistics. Special efforts will be made to enroll participants from underrepresented groups. Participants will be followed after completion, and the numbers attending graduate school in statistics and pursuing biostatistics careers will be documented. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are indispensible contributors to health sciences research. The demand for professionals with advanced training in biostatistics is high and will continue to increase, especially with the expanding challenges posed by big biomedical data. This six week summer research education program, a joint effort of North Carolina State University and Duke University, will enroll up to 20 US citizen/permanent resident participants from across the nation in the summers of 2020-2022 and expose them to the opportunities presented by careers in biostatistics and encourage them to seek graduate training in the field.",Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences,9888421,R25HL147228,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Names', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Talents', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'education research', 'experience', 'field trip', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'investigator training', 'laboratory experiment', 'lectures', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health research', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'summer institute', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2020,249789,0.07291678141476966
"Computational Social Science Training Program Project Summary/Abstract The Computational Social Science Training Program (CSSTP) at UC Berkeley provides training in advanced analytics to predoctoral students in the social and behavioral sciences studying health topics covered by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child and Human Development. CSSTP is a new program that combines Berkeley's long-standing strength in quantitative social and behavioral science with its nationally- recognized campus programs in data science education, practice, and research. It will serve five entering trainees per year over five years. The training faculty includes 22 social scientists who have exemplary records of developing and applying novel statistical methods to health-related social/behavioral science problems, as well as 13 data scientists who are leading figures in the foundations of mathematics, statistics/biostatistics, and computer science. Trainees, who will be drawn from a diverse pool of students in six social science doctoral programs, are provided with a rigorous and tailored program designed to teach a team science-based approach to problem solving and to emphasize the analysis of intensive or voluminous longitudinal data and high-density, large sample or population level agency databases. Each trainee is supported by a dual-preceptor model in which s/he is provided with a social sciences faculty mentor and a data science mentor who help to facilitate the trainee's progress through the program. CSSTP trainees are provided with community space at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS), a dynamic multi-disciplinary data science research center, where trainees work alongside other data science fellows in residence. After completing their first-year course requirements in their home departments, trainees formally enter the program in their second year of graduate school, devise an individual development plan, and take a core two-semester course in computational social science, team-taught by training faculty. This course introduces students to essential data science methods and tools, including Python programming, data management, natural language processing, machine learning, causal inference, and responsible conduct and reproducibility of research, through lectures, in-depth discussion of social science applications, and small group learning exercises. In the following year, students apply these skills through placements on collaborative health-related research teams or labs on campus and/or with external industry partners, thus developing skills in advanced analytics through research practice involving the development and implementation of new methods. Additional training tailored to student needs and interests is provided through elective courses, a weekly computational social science workshop series, and ongoing working groups at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and the Social Science D-Lab, a campus hub for data science training and research for social scientists. CSSTPs benefits will ripple out to the greater campus and beyond by stimulating new faculty collaborations and by creating a critical mass of rigorously trained computational social science students who will be competitive and qualified for jobs in rapidly changing and evolving data intensive fields.

"NRSA Training This revised CTSA Institutional Training Core (TL1) has been designed to leverage the strengths of The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), the umbrella organization that will provide an infrastructure to support and enhance clinical and translational research and training in New Jersey. Led by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS) and administered by the Rutgers Institute for Translational Medicine and Science (RITMS), NJ ACTS comprises an Alliance of three universities (Rutgers University, Princeton University, and the New Jersey Institute of Technology) and community-based organizations, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, data centers and two Health Information Exchanges. This unique and dynamic environment will allow us to create a robust and effective platform to train the next generation of translational researchers. Innovative translational research can neither be taught nor accomplished in a silo. We want to encourage our trainees to consider, from the earliest stages of their doctoral experience, the implication and application of their research efforts to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. To accomplish this, rather than limit our training within a particular department or program, we have gathered an initial cohort of highly productive mentors with proven expertise in basic biomedical and bioengineering research, clinical research, bioinformatics, biostatistics, machine learning, epidemiology, health policy and other key areas that will coalesce to provide mentorship to our trainees. Our cross-disciplinary team has been united as the “NJ ACTS Academy of Mentors” which will be the educational platform for this TL1 training effort. To enhance the translational nature of this experience, the Academy of Mentors will be shared by both our NJ ACTS Trainees (TL1) and Scholars (KL2). Strategically, we will focus on a trainee pool composed of students who have expressed, by choice of degree(s) and/or graduate program, an interest in translating basic science findings and concepts into disease-relevant applications (MD/PhD.

"Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NUCATS) Contact PD/PI: LLOYD-JONES, DONALD M NRSA-Training-001 (304) ABSTRACT: The health of children and adolescents is a critical determinant of our nation's health over the entire life course. Yet, research into child health lags behind that for adults. In part, this reflects historical, cultural and economic forces that tend to divert investigators into careers other than pediatric research. To address this concern, the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS) chose the unique approach of specifically training young investigators to apply engineering solutions to problems in child health. Our overall goal is to generate a community of pediatricians, data scientists and engineers who collaborate across disciplines, using modern technology to improve the health of children and adolescents. The central focus of this continuing and highly successful effort is this Multidisciplinary Training Program in Child and Adolescent Health TL1, which has three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will train 10 postdoctoral fellows in basic science or pediatrics for two years, in a creative and multidisciplinary environment where investigators are equipped to apply innovative engineering approaches to problems in child and adolescent health. The fellows must have a mentor in both pediatrics and engineering. Presently, their projects range from computer-controlled delivery of general anesthesia or using nanotechnology to treat brain tumors, to applying machine learning to optimize discharge planning. This innovative research experience is complemented by mentoring from the TL1 leadership and from their postdoctoral-fellow peers; required foundational elements, which promote communication across traditionally disparate scientific disciplines; required selective components, assigned to individual fellows to optimize their training in pediatric clinical and translational science; and a menu of enrichment opportunities that are optional for each trainee. All of these components include both didactic and experiential approaches. In Aim 2, to expand the pipeline of engineers entering child and adolescent health research, we will provide 2, one-year positions (1 supported by the CTSA and 1 by institutional funds) for predoctoral engineers entering the last year of PhD training, especially those representing underrepresented minorities, as they complete their research and write their thesis. By including engineering trainees who are interested in CTS in the training activities available to our TL1 postdoctoral fellows, we intend to enhance their potential commitment to pediatric translational science. Finally, in Aim 3, we will provide a summer research experience at Northwestern for 4 students in clinical post-baccalaureate programs at a traditionally underrepresented-minority institution. Our experience to date suggests that, with our ongoing involvement after the summer experience, many of these students have been inspired to seek careers in translational research. Together, these aims outline a comprehensive and successful program to increase the number and quality of investigators applying innovative approaches to improving child and adolescent health.

We will train clinical and basic science postdoctoral fellows with a common curriculum, so that they learn to work together to translate new technical advances into approaches to patient care. To expand the pipeline of trainees entering this field, we will also implement programs to attract predoctoral students and underrepresented-minority, masters-program students to child-health research.",Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NUCATS),9978142,TL1TR001423,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Basic Science', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Data Engineering', 'Data Scientist', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modernization', 'Nanotechnology', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Patient Care', 'Pediatric Research', 'Pediatrics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Students', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adolescent health', 'career', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'peer', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'summer research']",NCATS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,TL1,2020,732568,0.03564836987281291
"NRSA Training Core Contact PD/PI: Urban, Randall J. NRSA-Training-001 (207) J. NRSA Training Core (TL1) Project Summary The strategic objectives of our NRSA Training Core (TL1), which support the workforce development goals of our CTSA hub, are to provide “predoctoral students orientation to translational science and postdoctoral appointees advanced research training aligned with CTSA goals of advancing therapeutics (drugs, devices, and preventatives), clinical interventions, and behavioral modifications to improve health”. These objectives are being met by engaging trainees from diverse biomedical disciplines in an innovative, competency-based training program, centered on the authentic clinical and translational (C&T) research practices of our Multidisciplinary Translational Teams (MTTs). Existing curricula and training programs in the biomedical sciences at UTMB, as elsewhere, excel at developing an individual’s discipline-specific knowledge and technical skills, but are less adept at developing the core competencies needed to effectively participate in the interprofessional, multidisciplinary team-based research environment critical to translate scientific discoveries into improvements in human health. To address this gap, our Specific Aim is to produce highly skilled researchers who possess both an integrated knowledge of the human diseases that underlie their C&T research and learner-level appropriate competency in team management, leadership, conflict resolution and negotiations, interprofessional communication, stakeholder engagement, entrepreneurship, and the regulatory/ethical issues associated with human-subjects research and clinical trials. Since our program’s inception, trainees have engaged in a competency-based curriculum using the latest pedagogical approaches, active learning modalities, and authentic experiences. Our current TL1 curriculum includes: 1) the Interprofessional Translational Research Design (ITRD) Course, 2) a Team Leadership Workshop for predocs; 3) the Clinical Encounters course, and 4) dissertation/postdoctoral research projects co-mentored by both scientific and clinical experts. For this renewal application, we introduce several new training initiatives including: new courses in medical-/bio-informatics and machine learning, team science (e.g., TeamMAPPS) and community-engaged research, a bench-to-global health policy Vaccinology Track, and new opportunities for training in entrepreneurship. Training will continue to be personalize through reiterative use of the Individual Development Plan (IDP) by our trainees and mentors. In addition to tracking NCATS common metrics, the outcomes of our training on learner competency across multiple C&T research domains will be assessed using a robust set of rubrics and validated assessment tools. Results will continue to be disseminated to the education and research communities through, on-line course materials, publications, presentations and workshops. The need for well-trained C&T researchers with the knowledge and skills needed to advance new scientific discoveries into improvements in human health has never been greater. With further support from NIH/ NCATS for 6 full-time training slots (4 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral) and 10 short-term positions annually, we will continue to prepare the biomedical workforce needed to solve the health care challenges of the 21st century.

"Advanced Graduate Training Program in Theoretical Neuroscience We are requesting the continuation of a training program in theoretical neuroscience with funds to support 4 predoctoral trainees. Our goal is to train students who combine exceptional skills in mathematics, statistics, modeling and machine learning with a deep understanding of neurobiology. The complexity of neural systems and of the data that we can now obtain demands researchers with these skills if we are to realize the neuroscience community's goals of achieving a mechanistic understanding of nervous system function and making significant progress in the treatment of neural disorders and mental illness. Training will occur at the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia University, supported by the 6 faculty at the Center, faculty visitors to the Center, and 26 other faculty from the Departments of Neuroscience, Psychology, Biology, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering, and Statistics at Columbia. The Theory Center provides an exceptional environment in which pre-doctoral, post-doctoral and faculty researchers interact and collaborate extensively both within the Center and with researchers in experimental laboratories. Most trainees are members of the Columbia graduate program in Neurobiology and Behavior (with a small number drawn from other graduate programs) and take the courses that satisfy the requirements of that program. The required courses are augmented by a large selection of electives, including courses in theoretical neuroscience, statistics and machine learning. The goal of this training program is twofold: 1) To produce theoreticians who combine outstanding skills in analysis and model-building with a deep understanding and ""sense"" of biological neuroscience; and 2) To train experimentalist who are skilled at applying theoretical and computational methods in their research. This will be accomplished through extensive collaborations with outstanding experimental laboratories both at Columbia and elsewhere combined with training in state-of-the art theoretical methods. Whenever possible, students will be co-advised by both a member of the Theory Center faculty and a researcher from our associated experimental faculty, and they will be given desk space both in the Theory Center and in the laboratory of their experimental co-advisor. The opportunity to be involved in the operations of an outstanding laboratory and in the activities and intellectual atmosphere of a world-class theory center provides an exceptional training experience. The complexity of neuroscience data and the challenges of understanding and treating diseases and dysfunctions of the brain demand an unprecedented level of sophistication in data analysis and modeling. The proposed training program provides two solutions to this challenge: training theorists who combine technical expertise with a deep understanding of experimental neuroscience and of how to work with experimentalists; and training experimentalists who know how to apply theoretical methods and work with theorists. People with these combined skills will be essential for progress in neuroscience in the coming years.",Advanced Graduate Training Program in Theoretical Neuroscience,9918987,T32NS064929,"['Neurosciences', 'Training Programs']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,T32,2020,193686,0.12719341089807756
"Training in Computational Neural Engineering The proposal initiates a new, innovative training program in Computational Neural Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University to train the next generation of researchers at the intersection of computational neuroscience, data science, and clinical neurophysiology. It addresses the opportunities provided by the explosion of tools for measurement and manipulation of nervous system function and the challenges posed by the growing threat of neurological diseases and disorders on an expanding senior population. The program leverages past successes in federally-funded training efforts that have helped to catalyze rapid and recent growth in research and education in Computational Neural Engineering across Emory and Georgia. Early exposure to the intersection of fields is critical to the program mission. Interdisciplinary training in the first two years of the PhD program will provide trainees with unique opportunities for training across axes that span basic to clinical neuroscience, and from neural engineering to computational neuroscience, data science, and machine learning. Two graduate students per will be recruited from the applicant pools for the Biomedical Engineering (GT and Emory), Bioengineering (GT), Electrical and Computer Engineering (GT), and Machine Learning PhD programs, which collectively enroll over 200 PhD students per year. None of the participating programs offer research rotations or funding in the first year of graduate school. We will support a total of four students per year over a five-year period, providing two years of support for two entering students per year. funding such support will help attract the highest quality students to the program, and offer trainees the unique opportunity to rotate through research labs and establish new collaborative research projects. In our prior training experience, such interactions have led to new collaborations funded through fellowships and new research grants. Didactic training will complement core training in each PhD program with existing and new courses in computational neuroscience, neuropathology and neuroengineering, and a new course providing students with an immersive clinical experience at the Emory Brain Health Center. Extracurricular training includes Innovation Forums for clinician/engineering interactions, and a wide variety of seminars, methods clinics, and journal clubs. Trainees will also be provided with professional development for this new generation of researchers, including training in leadership, mentorship, neuroethics, and public scholarship. Trainees will also learn the growing industry in neural engineering, and will have opportunities for internships. Importantly, with solid preliminary evidence for the success in all of these ventures, this program targets an imperative area for growth. Our program will train the next generation of researchers to overcome challenges posed by the growing threat of neurological diseases and disorders on an expanding senior population. The training focuses on leveraging the explosion of new tools for understanding nervous system function in combination with a clinical understanding of neurological conditions and advanced methods in computation, data science, and machine learning.

"Precision Health Intervention Methodology Training in Self-Management of Multiple Chronic Conditions Project Summary /Abstract:  The U.S. is undergoing rapid macrosocial transformations; the population is growing older and becoming more diverse. An aging population needs more care; the frequency and burden of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) are rapidly increasing. The recent health paradigm shift initiated by the Precision Medicine Initiative, along with significant advances in computational science, artificial intelligence, and mobile/wearable technology, now offers important opportunities to advance self-management science through the development of strategies tailored to the individual level. Based not only on genetics but also psychosocial phenotypic characteristics, the current pace of social and technological change demands a comprehensive, structured, transdisciplinary approach to self-management research training for the next generation of nurse scientists.  The University of Texas at Austin’s School of Nursing is uniquely positioned to foster future nurse scientists who can develop effective personalized interventions addressing the complex needs of self- management for people with MCC. Located at the “epicenter of the health technology hub” in Austin, Texas, within one of the most vibrant transdisciplinary health research environments in the nation, we are well positioned to train future scientists in precision health methodologies addressing MCC-focused self- management science. The school currently operates two strong centers for excellence focusing on transdisciplinary research in self-management and health promotion for underserved populations. We also have established collaborative agreements with four active T32 training programs (population science, interdisciplinary neuroscience, biomedical engineering and medical informatics, and big data science) at UT- Austin to facilitate high impact, transdisciplinary research training for all trainees in these four programs. To capitalize on our momentum of collaborative research and maximize our educational resources, we propose a new PhD training program (NIH T32) to provide future nurse scientists (13 pre-doctoral and 6 post-doctoral trainees over 5 years) with critical skills and knowledge to develop and implement innovative, effective and personalized interventions for populations suffering from MCCs.  The specific objectives of this transdisciplinary training program are: (1) To provide trainees with cutting edge knowledge and methods for constructing precise, personalized interventions for people with MCCs; (2) to utilize resources throughout our university and community to ensure training across disciplines to develop creative, successful clinical investigators who will make a major impact on advancing self- management science through precision health methodology; (3) to elevate the existing strengths of the university’s collegial, interactive, interdisciplinary research environment by creating a national model for training nurse scientists with precision health expertise. Managing multiple chronic illness is difficult task for everyone and often one size does not fit well. Given the rapid social and technological changes, a comprehensive, structured transdisciplinary approach to research training is becoming particularly important for preparing the next generation of nurse scientists.

"Noninvasive Cardiovascular Imaging Research Training Program Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide. Non-invasive imaging provides valuable information to assess differential diagnosis and guide management. However, there is a gap in academically-oriented CV imaging training programs that are able to train specialists with the knowledge base, experience, research tools, analytical and leadership skills to fully develop, apply, and evaluate the increasingly complex gamut of CV imaging possibilities. This is the second competing renewal application for this T32 program. This program offers post-doctoral research training for individuals with an MD, or combined MD/PhD degrees, who have completed clinical training in cardiology, radiology, or CV imaging who are committed to pursuing an academic career in CV imaging science. Our goal is to continue to provide outstanding opportunities for multi- disciplinary research training for clinician-scientists in CV imaging with the clinical and investigative skills to establish independent careers, mentor others, and lead their own programs. Since initial funding in 2010, we have graduated 16 post-doctoral fellows. Key indicators of the effectiveness of this young program include: (1) 15/16 graduates remain involved in academic medicine and science, and one is completing additional clinical training; (2) 8/10 fellows who completed the program 2 years ago have received peer reviewed funding by NIH, VA, or ACC. Of the 6 graduates from the last 2 years, one received an ACC mentored award, one received grant funding from the Radiological Society of North America, and one just submitted a K award; (3) the grant has sponsored 133 unique publications in top peer review journals; (4) 50% of our graduates hold leadership roles in their respective imaging programs, and 38% have prominent leadership roles in professional organizations and others. Our mentors are primarily comprised of cardiologists and radiologists, but also include faculty from disciplines outside CV imaging including clinical and basic scientists. All the mentors have a strong track record of research collaborations. We offer research training opportunities in 8 thematic areas: (1) molecular imaging, (2) myocardial structure, function, and metabolism, (3) genetics, (4) pulmonary hypertension, (5) outcomes research, (6) ischemic heart disease, (7) women's health, (8) radiomics and artificial intelligence. The proposed program supports 3 positions/year for two years of continued research training. With this renewal, we continue our primary goals of providing leadership in academic cardiovascular imaging and training future leaders in imaging science to improve outcomes in cardiovascular disease.

"UCLA and Caltech integrated Cardiovascular Medicine for Bioengineers (iCMB) ABSTRACT This T32 program represents a new paradigm for training biophysical scientists and engineers to traverse cardiovascular medicine. The convergence of engineering with medicine is transforming clinical and patient care via advances in flexible electronics for sensing and imaging, coupled with machine learning, which has introduced new innovations to confront the rising endemic of cardiometabolic disorders. The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) are partnering to develop the UCLA/Caltech integrated Cardiovascular Medicine for Bioengineers (iCMB) Program, that will be formalized into a 2-year, structured curriculum with an emphasis on recruiting the under-represented post- doctoral engineers or biophysical scientists into leadership roles in academia and industry. The approach is to strengthen individualized training in 1) advanced sensing or 2) imaging coupled with machine learning to address 3) cardiometabolic disease. The iCMB program will be built upon two successful Caltech and UCLA joint training programs: the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) for MD-PhD students and the unique Subspecialty Training and Advanced Research Program (STAR) for fellowship-level physicians to obtain a PhD. The partnerships with the industry leaders from Amgen, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, and Edwards Lifesciences have enriched our internship, mentorship, and leadership programs. Both the Caltech Diversity Center and UCLA Faculty Diversity & Development Office have supported workshops on Science Technology Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) for women and under-represented minorities. To implement this iCMB Program, we have developed a novel mentoring and self-evaluating structure in the inclusion of 24 seasoned mentors, 4 emerging faculty, 22 Clinical Faculty (42% female), and 10 industry leaders. Each iCMB scholar will have co-mentorships: a primary mentor from cardiometabolic medicine and a secondary from enabling technologies or industry. In Year 1, iCMB scholars will develop fundamental knowledge in advanced imaging, sensors, or computation and didactic training for ethics in biomedical research and publications. In Year 2, iCMB scholar will have an option 1) to participate in a certificate in Pathways in Clinical and Translational Research from the UCLA Clinical Translational Science Institute (CTSI) or Law and Technology for FDA regulatory science (BE188/299); and/or 2) to participate in UCLA CTSI-sponsored professional development in preparation for an academic or industry career. Both Caltech and UCLA Deans have committed matching funds for each iCMB scholar. Our Vice Provost for UCLA Graduate Education has also committed supplemental trainee support to enhance the diversity of trainees. Therefore, the complementary and synergistic strengths of the Caltech/UCLA iCMB Program provide a new infusion of workforce prepared to solve the worldwide endemic of cardiometabolic disease. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative) The Caltech/UCLA integrated Cardiovascular Medicine for Bioengineers (iCMB) embraces a humanistic approach to integrate training in imaging or sensing coupled with machine learning to confront the rising endemic of cardiometabolic disease. The joint mentorship with the biomedical faculty alongside with engineering or industry partnership provides an interactive ecosystem for recruiting and retaining our under- represented iCMB scholars.

"Training in Complex Systems and Data Science Approaches Applied to the Neurobiology of Drug Use The purpose of this program is to train pre- and post-doctoral scholars in the application of complex systems and data science approaches to the neurobiology of substance abuse, with the dual strategies of: (1) training candidates with expertise in data science, applied mathematics, computer science, and complex systems to apply their skills to the neuroscience of addiction; and (2) training candidates pursuing addiction research from neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology and genetics in the theory and application of Big Data methods, including network analysis, machine learning algorithms, and Bayesian statistical models. Trainees will be paired across disciplines, and academic stages, for research collaboration and reciprocal tutoring to facilitate the development of proficiency in each trainee's new field. Each trainee will also be dual mentored, their secondary mentor being their partner's primary. Over its five-year duration, the program will provide three years of funding for each of five pairs of pre- and post-doctoral researchers, with an initial cohort of four (two pairs), and additional pairs entering in each of the middle three years. The core curriculum will incorporate: (1) the established complex systems and data science graduate certificate at the University of Vermont; (2) course work in neuroscience, psychology and addiction, including classes focused on developing human subjects research skills; as well as (3) specialized courses designed to directly and effectively bridge the gap between the core disciplines. Trainees will also attend a biweekly journal club and monthly seminar, led by senior participants in the program, to further support the acquisition of multidisciplinary research skills.  The overarching aim of the program is to produce researchers poised to apply state-of-the-art analytic tools to understand the neurobiology of drug abuse. The focus will be characterizing the neural substrates of addiction and other comorbid psychopathologies, always with an eye toward clinical application. Recent increases in the quantity and quality of large-sample, multi-modal datasets that address the neural, genetic and environmental substrates of addiction make this a propitious time for such a training program. Researchers at UVM are ideally suited to provide this training as there exist close links between addiction research, cognitive neuroscience, complex systems and data science, and the mentoring faculty have access to exceptional datasets that are ideal for interrogation with Big Data methods. Armed with coherent domain knowledge and practiced with advanced methods for complex systems, trainees will develop analysis pipelines that: (1) incorporate sophisticated aggregation of longitudinal and multi-modal datasets, including various neuroimaging modalities, genetic information, survey and clinical data; (2) harness the power of supercomputing and modern machine learning algorithms to step beyond linear and univariate effects; and (3) address questions of immediate clinical importance to substance abuse that can inform the determination of risk factors, treatment and intervention strategy, and policy decisions. The overarching aim of this training program is to produce substance abuse researchers well versed in the theory and application of state-of-the-art analytic tools for complex systems in the context of cognitive neuroscience broadly defined. The research focus is on characterizing the neural substrates of addiction, with natural extensions to the study of other psychopathologies, and all work undertaken will maintain an eye toward clinical application. Research results, methods and analysis pipelines developed by trainees and their mentors will be made publically available, and may inform the determination of risk factors, treatment and intervention strategy, and policy decisions made by public health professionals.!",Training in Complex Systems and Data Science Approaches Applied to the Neurobiology of Drug Use,9917762,T32DA043593,"['Complex', 'Data Science', 'Drug usage', 'Neurobiology', 'System', 'Training']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,T32,2020,259245,0.044996667657393206
"Training in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics Project Summary We propose to continue the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) pre-doctoral training program at Harvard Medical School. Since its inception in 2000, this program has provided rigorous multidisciplinary education in genome sciences for those students with proven excellence in quantitative fields. The gap between the ability to generate large amounts genomic data and the ability to efficiently analyze and interpret them continues to grow. Our program aims to train multi-disciplinary investigators who are capable of both integrating the genome-scale technologies into their experimental investigations and synthesizing the resulting datasets into coherent knowledge frameworks and mathematical models. The BIG training program draws on three significant strengths of the local academic environment: the breadth of talented investigators at Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals and research institutes; the rich variety of quantitatively-oriented courses in bioinformatics and genomics offered at Harvard and MIT; and national leadership of BIG faculty in genome-scale disease research, including harnessing of genomic approaches to clinical applications. The BIG pre-doctoral curriculum includes the following: 1) courses in fundamentals of genetics and molecular biology, taken alongside graduate students in the biological sciences; 2) statistics and machine learning, with focus on their applications to population studies, clinical medicine and basic biology; 3) survey of the larger scope of biomedical sciences, including medical informatics and translational medicine. This training program will continue to produce leaders, both in academia and industry, who are using genomic sciences to advance biomedical research and its application to medicine. Project Narrative Integrating genomics into the practice of biomedical research and medicine is a primary goal of the National Human Genome Research Institute's strategic plan. The Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Program at Harvard Medical School meets this goal by providing students trained in the quantitative sciences the intellectual tools to integrate genomics with biomedical sciences, access to “big data” from genome sciences and healthcare systems, and faculty mentors who are experts in genomics and bioinformatics.

"Biomedical Data Science Graduate Training at Stanford ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The expanded ability to collect data at all scales-molecular, cellular, tissue, organism and population-has created unparalleled opportunities for biomedical discovery. These opportunities cross all areas of research from basic science to clinical care. In response to these tremendously exciting emerging challenges in data science, Stanford University announced the creation of a new Department of Biomedical Data Science (DBDS) to begin in fall of 2015. Fundamental to the DBDS is bringing together faculty in (1) informatics and computer science, and (2) biostatistics and mathematical modeling, who work closely with a broad range of (3) biomedical science collaborators to advance knowledge. The Stanford Biomedical Informatics (BMI) training program is focused on the creation of new methods for the organization, analysis and modeling of biomedical data and knowledge. The BMI program has been a small interdisciplinary program at Stanford for more than 33 years; nonetheless, it has produced many leaders in biomedical informatics and data science. The BMI program will now have its administrative home in the DBDS, and will become the epicenter for biomedical data science training at Stanford. We are able quickly to respond to the shortage of trained scientists in biomedical data science because of a flexible curriculum, an unusually fertile set of course offerings, and a plethora of research opportunities. In this proposal, we outline a plan to engage faculty broadly across the University to create scalable mechanisms for training the next generation of biomedical data scientists, and creating a pathway for ""data science"" within the BMI program that stresses statistical reasoning, machine learning and data mining of biomedical data.

"Graduate Training in Computational and Systems Biology Project Summary The objective is to support a Computational Systems Biology training program (CSBTP) to train students to become leaders in biomedical research at the interface of biology, computation and engineering. The effort is centered in MIT's interdisciplinary predoctoral training program in Computational and Systems Biology (CSB), which is the primary training program at MIT for students interested in computational and systems biology and is the only program that emphasizes interdisciplinary training and research in the field. Program faculty are concentrated in the three founding departments – Biological Engineering (BE), Biology, and Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) – with additional involvement of faculty from other departments. Research interests of training faculty span a wide range of CSB-related areas, including Regulatory Genomics and Proteomics, Precision Medicine and Medical Genomics, Molecular Biophysics and Structural Biology, Biological Networks and Machine Learning, and Cancer Systems Biology. This proposal seeks to expand the pool of training faculty significantly, including 7 faculty newly hired in the past 5 years who have active research programs in the field. Students apply directly to the CSB Ph.D. program from their undergraduate or Master’s institution and receive multi- and inter-disciplinary training in the field of computational and systems biology. The proposal seeks funding for 10 predoctoral traineeships per year, enabling extended research rotations and participation in special program activities. Unique aspects of the program include: (a) unusually diverse collection of research areas across science and engineering, with highly collaborative interdisciplinary faculty; (b) a unique core of interdisciplinary classroom subjects that combine biology, engineering, statistics and computation; (c) intensive advising and multi-disciplinary thesis committees to optimize the training experience for students from diverse academic backgrounds; (d) an annual retreat with participation of students and faculty focusing on research, careers, and challenges to interdisciplinary research. Project Narrative Biological discovery is increasingly driven by large-scale generation and analysis of biomedical data, enabled by new technologies for sequencing, imaging and manipulating biological systems. We propose to train scientists who have interdisciplinary expertise in concepts, approaches and technologies from biology, computer science, and engineering. These scientists will be well positioned to apply sophisticated technologies and advanced modeling techniques to design and predict sites of intervention in complex gene networks to achieve desired therapeutic aims in complex diseases such as diabetes and cancer, and to help realize the potential of precision medicine.",Graduate Training in Computational and Systems Biology,9969375,T32GM087237,"['Computational Biology', 'Systems Biology', 'Training']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,T32,2020,385645,0.12996735781568103
"Training Program in Computational Genomics Project Summary University of Pennsylvania has trained computational genomicists for the past 20 years supported by the NHGRI T32 program, training 52 predoctoral and 13 postdoctoral trainees the majority of whom have gone on to careers in research and development. Here we propose to continue our Computational Genomic Training program with eight predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees focused on the theme of Data Science and Machine/Statistical Learning methods as applied to genomics data.

This application represents the consolidation of three NIEHS T32 training grants at Columbia University into a unified training program designed to address critical needs in the field of environmental health sciences. We propose a program with 18 predoctoral students and 8 postdoctoral scholars. Our mentoring team has substantial funding from NIEHS (>$13,000,000 per year) and other agencies (>$40,000,0000 per year) that provides a wealth of opportunities for original research by both pre- and postdoctoral trainees. Our predoctoral trainees will participate in: 1) a core curriculum in environmental health sciences (using a life course approach to study molecular mechanisms of disease, epidemiologic methods, health effects of climate change, and the exposome) 2) a core curriculum in data sciences, 3) specialized coursework to support dissertation research, 4) research rotations, 5) small interdisciplinary training groups, and 6) dissertation research. Although our trainees will continue to take traditional didactic coursework, the addition of small interdisciplinary training groups, workshops, and boot camps creates a facile platform that can rapidly evolve to enable student exposure to cutting-edge methods that address future needs in the field. Through a collaboration with the Columbia University Data Science Institute (DSI) we propose a highly innovative training program for our postdoctoral trainees. One of the leading data science programs in the world, the Columbia DSI will provide complementary training and support for our fellows, including participation in their existing data science postdoctoral fellows program based in computer science and engineering. Fellows will acquire advanced data science skills to complement their environmental health science research (the primary focus on their training). In their second year, these fellows will enhance their leadership skills by facilitating our workshops, bootcamps, and mini-courses (machine learning, data visualization, network science) for the predoctoral trainees. Thus, the postdoctoral trainees will acquire a skillset that prepares them to apply advanced data science approaches to environmental health in the laboratory and in the classroom. Moreover, each postdoctoral fellow will lead (with an assigned faculty mentor) a small interdisciplinary training group of predoctoral trainees, providing an ongoing forum for interaction and collaboration between the pre- and postdoctoral trainees and enhancing their skills in guiding team science.

"UCSF Data Science Training to Advance Behavioral and Social Science Expertise for Health Research (DaTABASE) Program Summary Behavioral and social science researchers are essential for advancing research on reducing health disparities. The next generation of such researchers must be equipped with the most powerful, contemporary analytic tools. Newly available data and methods have the potential to transform the questions asked, the research designs used, and the statistical approaches applied to deepen our understanding of fundamental drivers of health and increase our capacity to improve population health and reduce disparities. To take advantage of these opportunities, we need researchers with interdisciplinary training that allows them to connect the traditional behavioral and social science expertise with the rapidly evolving technical repertoire of computational health scientists. The UCSF Data Science Training to Advance Behavioral and Social Science Expertise for Health Research (DaTABASE) program braids training strands previously operating independently within UCSF. Particular strengths of DaTABASE include: 1) Grounding in a rigorous, interdisciplinary quantitative training program for a foundation in study designs and statistical analyses to deliver actionable evidence on health; 2) Integration of multiple data streams, including: ‘omics, clinical (e.g., UC-wide, geolocated and longitudinal medical records, clickstream data from UCSF’s unique clinical informatics infrastructure), digital (device-based data flows, social media data, technology enabled cohorts), population (e.g., San Francisco Department of Public Health data linking health and social services provided to homeless individuals or other vulnerable populations) and policy data sets (e.g., local policies regulating cannabis retail outlets in California communities); 3) training and research activities organized around the elimination of health disparities. DaTABASE trainees will complete the rigorous methodological training for a PhD in Epidemiology and Translational Science. Additional content training, overseen by faculty in the UCSF Center for Health and Community, will provide theoretical frameworks and disciplinary background for social and behavioral sciences. Additional quantitative methods training will be delivered via the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute (BCHSI).

"Data Science Training in Demography and Population Health Abstract The Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology (CSDE) at the University of Washington proposes a training program to create a new generation of population scientists and demographers equipped with skills to conduct data intensive research with advanced computational and statistical methods. Population science provides a crucial interdisciplinary framework for understanding the social, economic, political, and demographic dynamics affecting patterns of disease, mortality, fertility, and migration, but to extract signal from noise in the complex interplay of these processes the next generation requires a training in state-of-the-art methods. The program will prepare trainees to be leaders in problems involving a wide range of complex data, including data arising from multiple sources, data not intended for research (e.g. administrative data), dynamic or spatial data, network data, and “big data’’ sources. At the core of this program is a collaboration between CSDE, the eScience Institute (UW’s data science center), and the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences (CSSS). These three institutes combine extensive expertise in demographic methods, data science, computer science and statistical methods and have a long, successful record of collaboration on research and training activities, including a BD2K track in Big Data for Demographic Research. Through this collaboration, trainees will take a series of coursework in the following areas: advanced statistical methods and machine learning, coding, databases, data visualization/communication, and data ethics. Trainees will also take part in team-mentoring processes, where they develop an apprenticeship relationship with a primary mentor but also learn directly from other faculty and trainees through collaborative projects and seminars. Mentors will come from all three centers, along with a variety of additional departments, selected to provide the most relevant expertise, including multiple faculty from the highly-ranked departments of Biostatistics, Statistics and Computer Science & Engineering. Further, trainees will get hands-on experience through rotations with on-campus and local partners. Each trainee will do a rotation in eScience’s Reproducibility and Open Science Special Interest Group (SIG), which develops resources that facilitate reproducible research. The training program will ensure trainees obtain the requisite theoretical and applied experience to take on whatever challenges and complexities the data revolution next provides. CSDE requests support for 5 pre-doctoral trainees per year, with total direct costs of $1,744,650.00, over 5 years. The Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology (CSDE) at the University of Washington proposes a training program to create a new generation of population scientists and demographers equipped with skills to conduct data intensive research with advanced computational and statistical methods.

"Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine The aim of our multidisciplinary institutional training program, based in the Schools of Medicine and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, is to train predoctoral engineering students and physician postdoctoral fellows in Neuroengineering and its clinical translation. Disorders of the nervous system, such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, depression, dementia, and head trauma, constitute 35% of all disease and disability, and the burden is rising. There is an explosion of promising therapies for these disorders in new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate neural circuits, but translating these therapies from the laboratory to patients is a challenge. It requires talented engineers educated in clinical science and technically proficient physicians who speak the same language. Together these investigators must navigate a complex scientific, regulatory, and clinical landscape. Despite the huge demand, few formal, interdisciplinary Neuroengineering training programs exist.  Our program is shared by the Penn Schools of Medicine and Engineering focused on Neuroengineering and Clinical Translation and recruits from an excellent pool of ~60 MD fellows and 55-75 PhD students each year. Physician and Engineering trainees will together become fluent in cutting-edge technologies at the forefront of Neuroengineering, such as devices, neurostimulation, machine learning, algorithm development, cloud computing, nanotechnology and materials science. They will innovate new therapies for human disease and gain a thorough understanding of the clinical, regulatory, and developmental environments necessary to safely bring new technologies to patients. The program’s core is a group of collaborative, multidisciplinary faculty mentors in engineering and the clinical neurosciences.  In addition to dedicated neuroengineering research, our training program includes: (1) a longitudinal mentored clinical experience for PhD candidates, (2) engineering lab immersion and tutorial for MD postdoctoral fellows, (3) courses and seminars in Engineering, Neuroscience, Medicine and Statistics, (4) training in the proper conduct of research, (5) workshops on professional and career development, including scientific writing, oral presentations, and laboratory management, (6) new to the program will be a dedicated statistician and expert guest speakers leading intensive didactic seminars on quantitative tools and approaches, experimental design, and statistical methodology, and (7) all journal clubs, workshops and one-on-one mentoring will have time devoted to promoting quantitative literacy and thinking to address issues in research.  The program, unique at Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment, including a compact campus where robust centers for Engineering, Medicine, Neuroscience and Statistics all reside within two blocks of each other, united through Penn’s Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics. Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine Disorders of the nervous system represent one of the largest, fastest growing areas of medical need in the United States and the most promising therapies for these disorders are new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate activity in neural circuits. There is a great need for engineers educated in clinical neuroscience and physicians with technical backgrounds to train and work together, to effectively bring these critical technologies to patient care. The goal of this multidisciplinary program is to train pre-doctoral engineering students, and post-doctoral MD and MD-PhD fellows together in Neuroengineering research, to translate their work to clinical care, and ultimately improve the lives of individuals with brain and nervous system disorders.",Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine,9936906,T32NS091006,"['Medicine', 'Training Programs']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,T32,2020,437226,0.12055302249767488
"Training Program for Interactionist Cognitive Neuroscience (ICoN) Our training program for Interactionist Cognitive Neuroscience (ICoN) seeks to provide student-focused, interdisciplinary training in computational cognitive neuroscience that integrates data from multiple scales and levels of analysis. Transformative gains in understanding the human brain and mental health require integration across multiple levels of analysis. Recent historic advances in genetics and cellular biology are paving the way for understanding fundamentals of neural function. At the other end of the spectrum, methods for imaging and stimulating human brains non-invasively have led to revolutionary advances in discovering the macro-scale organization supporting perception, motivation, and cognition. Now, a major effort at the `systems' level between these two scales is beginning to uncover the activity, connectivity, and computations of neural circuits. The advent of this systems-level progress holds the promise of linking core circuit computations to emergent human behavior and leading to detailed, transdiagnostic models of mental illness. However, as we recently argued (Badre, Frank and Moore, 2015 Neuron), fulfilling this promise requires making direct links between circuit-level computation and the emergent function of the human system. We believe that integrating systems- and human neuroscience in this way demands a systematic approach built on two key strategies. First, formal computational models must be used to provide principled links between levels of analysis; and, second, complementary methods must be applied, and in the ideal case parallel human and non-human studies conducted in coordination. Achieving these aims requires a new generation of scientists that can take full advantage of multiple techniques and data sources, and who are deeply versed in computational theory. Traditional neuroscience training relies on an apprenticeship model that limits students to a single lab and level of inquiry. Thus, a specialized training program is required to specifically equip neuroscientists for this `Interactionist' approach. ICoN will provide this training emphasizing the two tenets: I. Computation is key to translating between levels. Students must be rigorously quantitatively trained in formal theory. A close corollary is that they must be fluent in the advanced analysis methods necessary for cross-level integration (e.g., machine learning). II. Next-generation scholars must have expertise at multiple levels. Students must be trained to use and integrate multiple methods and data sources. Further, they must have the skills (and courage) to pursue ideas to their next most logical step, to be question driven and not technique limited. Students will be trained to conduct integrative research projects across domains such as human cognitive neuroscience, systems neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Project Narrative This is an interdisciplinary predoctoral program in computational cognitive neuroscience. Funds from this program will support the training of advanced predoctoral candidates who are capable of applying a combination of empirical and theoretical approaches that decisively addresses their scientific questions about the mind and brain.

"Medical Imaging Informatics Training Grant ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) With the “digital era of biomedicine” upon us, exciting opportunities arise to revolutionize how we perform scien- tific research and deliver healthcare. Burgeoning areas like precision medicine foreshadow a transformation of how we understand disease and its individually-tailored treatment. In this context, the importance of imaging continues to grow, both as a driver of new knowledge and as a vital tool which uses these insights towards better detection, diagnosis, and treatment for patients. But achieving the full promise of this future still requires over- coming many barriers, and new imaging informaticians must be equipped with the cutting-edge skills that will create and support the necessary computational advances and methods. The UCLA Medical Imaging Informatics (MII) training program aims to be a leader in training this next generation of imaging informaticians who will develop the needed computational approaches and applications that enable this future. Bringing together leading experts from across our institution in imaging, engineering (computer and data science, electrical, bioengineering), (bio)statistics, and medicine, MII envisions an environment fostering interdisciplinary teaching and mentoring of students; and promoting innovative research throughout the spectrum of imaging informatics. MII's training program involves a comprehensive 1-year core curriculum introducing foun- dational principles of the discipline, forming a breadth of understanding while reinforcing the technical proficien- cies needed by any imaging informatician. Students complete coursework covering topics presented from the perspective of medical imaging and healthcare, including: information architectures; data and knowledge repre- sentation; data mining; machine learning; biostatistics; and information retrieval. Cross-cutting topics (e.g., radi- ogenomics, multimodal data integration and biomarker development) are presented throughout these courses. In parallel to the core curriculum, students are immediately engaged in research, completing rotations with faculty to gain an appreciation for contemporary imaging informatics projects. With this experience, PhD students sub- sequently specialize via more advanced elective coursework customized to their particular research interests. Students are challenged to propose, develop, and test new imaging informatics methods that will advance the discipline, as well as ultimately change and affect healthcare. Importantly, both training and research are inter- woven within a biomedical application domain and with appropriate PhD and MD mentorship to ensure compu- tational/informatics, clinical, and real-world translational insights and guidance. Recognizing the evolving land- scape of the biomedical workforce, our T32 includes a number of professional development activities, including internships, providing practical (research) experiences in different settings. Through the experiences gained dur- ing this T32 training program, MII students will become independent scientists, prepared to contribute to and lead imaging informatics as it continues to grow. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The UCLA Medical Imaging Informatics (MII) training program aims to train and inspire a new generation of imaging informaticians who will lead the development of innovative approaches that inform and enable precision medicine. MII establishes a cross-campus, interdisciplinary environment to teach and mentor future scientists in cutting-edge computational and data science methods towards imaging; and creates novel, team science re- search opportunities in which graduate students work and learn from leading experts in the field. MII trainees are exposed to the breadth of contemporary imaging informatics research, and are ultimately prepared to be productive, independent scientists that will participate in shaping the discipline as biomedical research and healthcare evolve.",Medical Imaging Informatics Training Grant,10006830,T32EB016640,"['Grant', 'Medical Imaging', 'informatics training']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,T32,2020,175095,0.12049962863819812
"Training in Child Health Services Research and Implementation Science This renewal application builds on the expertise of an experienced and dedicated faculty with a 23-year history of leading successful AHRQ-funded, post-doctoral NRSA training programs focused specifically on pediatric health services research. In an increasingly dynamic US health care system, meeting the needs of children will require health services researchers to be trained in novel and wide-ranging methods to study and improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of health care. Through expanding faculty and partnerships, our program stands ready to meet the needs of our trainees to tackle health services research that builds on advances in science, technology, and data analytics, including genomics; data mining and machine learning; novel diagnostics and therapeutics; and information technology. In this renewal, we will continue the core programmatic collaborations among Boston Children's Hospital, the MassGeneral Hospital for Children, and the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School as well as the successful engagement of our newest partner—the Institute for Healthcare Improvement—which has brought its recognized expertise in care improvement and implementation science to our trainees through curricular enhancements and research opportunities. As both the development of research and its implementation are increasingly informed by patients and the patient experience, our program will continue to engage patients and parents to provide substantive feedback on trainees' current and future research, as an integral aspect of our program's culture. For this renewal, we will also engage with new partners to address the expanding role of information technology in healthcare. Our program will focus on four pillars of training: 1) cutting edge observational methods to learn from health and health system data; 2) application of implementation science and related methods to improve the design, delivery, and evaluation of care for children across a variety of financing and delivery systems; 3) incorporating the perspective of patients and families into the process for designing and conducting research; and 4) framing research in children as a part of health over the life course, especially the pervasive, enduring impact of disparities in care and services. The program will support 6 stipends per year (3 first-year and 3 second-year continuing postdoctoral fellows) to create a critical mass of trainees across subspecialties, areas of research, and methodological domains. In addition to conducting closely mentored research, each trainee will complete the requirements of an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for core skills of biostatistics and epidemiology, and participate in advanced health services research methods training. Our well-developed program infrastructure and system for close monitoring of trainees' progress will ensure the continuation of our record of graduating individuals who will lead relevant, applied health services research that translates into both improved care and health outcomes for all children. The proposed renewal will continue our successful program to train child health researchers to conduct meaningful research leading to improvements in health care delivery for children.

"Training in Oncology Population Sciences (TOPS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Training in Oncology Population Sciences (TOPS) T32 program will train postdoctoral fellows to conduct research at the T3 and T4 interface to translate knowledge from the lab into practice and population health to reduce the burden of cancer. The need for translational research at the T3 and T4 interface stems from persistent disparities in cancer outcomes and implementation gaps between what is possible in the context of clinical trials and what happens in routine practice. The TOPS program will train 3 postdoctoral fellows each year in collaboration with 36 faculty from across the 7 institutions of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Training will provide fellows with the skills necessary to address the challenges and opportunities brought about by the tremendous growth in the complexity of cancer care, precision medicine, electronic health records, mobile health, machine learning and data sharing. The TOPS program has 3 specific strategies to achieve this overarching objective: 1) training in core methods and skills necessary for investigation through coursework and participation in regular seminars, workshops and reading; 2) intensive focus on a research project with close supervision from one or more mentors; and, 3) training in professional skills that are prerequisite for investigation including project development, grant writing, presentation, building and working with diverse teams, running a dry-laboratory and the responsible conduct of research. The TOPS T32 proposal is a renewal of the successful R25CA092203 Program in Cancer Outcomes Research Training (PCORT), which trained 41 pre- and post-doctoral fellows between 2002 and 2017. TOPS will be co- led by Dr. Nancy Keating, a primary care physician, and Dr. Deborah Schrag, a medical oncologist, both accomplished cancer-focused population scientists who served on the PCORT Steering Committee and trained numerous fellows who have become independent researchers. TOPS intends to train postdoctoral students with degrees in the fields of medicine, nursing, behavioral science, pharmacy, economics, clinical epidemiology, health policy, informatics, and engineering for careers dedicated to cancer-focused population science. The core of the program is a group of 36 faculty mentors and 13 emerging mentors with expertise in quality measurement, design of patient, clinician, community and health system-level interventions, conduct of pragmatic trials, comparative effectiveness research, analysis of survey, administrative and electronic health record data, and expertise in organizational and behavioral strategies that optimize implementation. At the end of the two-year training, TOPS program participants will be well-equipped with the skills necessary to launch independent research careers in cancer-focused population science and have access to the core resources of the DF/HCC and the Harvard Catalyst program for translational research training.

"iDISCOVER: Integrated Data Science Training in CardioVascular Medicine Abstract: This new T32 proposal will support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows pursuing integrated data science training in cardiovascular (CV) medicine at UCLA. Integrated data science training programs are very limited in today’s CV biomedical community. Data science challenges facing CV medicine are in many ways unique and have a long historic track record of information and data. CV diseases are chronic, heterogeneous disorders that exhibit distinct temporal profiles combined with multi-organ alterations, necessitating novel analysis platforms that integrate findings across expanded continuums of diverse information (e.g., text, imaging, omics). The complexity and size of CV datasets have pushed computational approaches to their limits, thus attenuating the rate for adding value in CV medicine. To this end, there is broad consensus that we must merge data science with CV medicine. The creation of a next-generation workforce having more advanced understanding of data science tactics for addressing real-world CV problems will ultimately realize precision CV medicine. Our T32 fills a unique niche in CV data science that is currently missing, both at UCLA and nationally. The UCLA Integrated Data Science Training in CV Medicine (iDISCOVER) Program draws upon faculty from the UCLA Schools of Medicine and Engineering, to establish a program for trainees committed to intensive data science applications in CV medicine. We have a substantiated track record in establishing training programs, as evidenced by our NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative, Heart BD2K Center at UCLA. Experience has enabled us to construct a T32 research program targeting the most pressing data science questions in CV medicine. Our two-year program will accept qualified students who have completed 1st year PhD training from Computer Science (CS), Bioinformatics (BI) or Bioengineering (BE); and eligible postdoc fellows from elite CV programs. We will train predoctoral students during their second and third year of PhD training, and postdoctoral fellows during their first and second year of their fellowship. Trainees will engage in advanced coursework within the specific focus areas: (i) omics phenotyping-supported outcome studies; (ii) machine learning-supported approaches in CV medicine; and (iii) information indexing and knowledgebase construction. Trainees will engage in CV clinical rotations to give them exposure to pressing CV data science questions. Trainees will be guided by a co-mentoring arrangement (1 CV mentor and 1 data science mentor). We have an outstanding group of 14 core faculty and 6 clinical supporting faculty members in the UCLA Schools of Medicine, Engineering and Life Sciences. Our faculty have established, vibrant and well-funded research programs with strong histories of guiding students to successful careers. Our program promotes the training of underrepresented minority groups, as demonstrated by training records of all faculty. Our iDISCOVER program has the institutional backing from Schools of Medicine, Engineering, Grad Division, Depts. of CS, BI, and BE, as well as Cardiology and Physiology. These elements ensure solid support for program implementation, advancement and success. PROGRAM NARRATIVE The UCLA iDISCOVER Program aims to train and inspire a new generation of cardiovascular informaticians who will lead the development of innovative approaches that inform and enable precision cardiovascular medicine. iDISCOVER establishes a cross-campus, interdisciplinary environment to teach and mentor future scientists in cutting-edge computational and data science methods; and encourages novel, team science research opportu- nities for engineering graduate students to work with and learn from leading experts in cardiovascular medicine. iDISCOVER trainees are exposed to the breadth of contemporary biomedical informatics research, and are ulti- mately prepared to be productive, independent scientists that will participate in shaping the discipline of modern data science-driven cardiovascular research and healthcare.",iDISCOVER: Integrated Data Science Training in CardioVascular Medicine,9986882,T32HL139450,"['Cardiovascular system', 'Data Science', 'Medicine', 'Training']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,T32,2020,270503,0.08010704907727857
"Physics and Biology in Medicine Research Training Abstract: The specific aim of this training grant's competitive renewal proposal is to continue the development of research scientists that are well versed in physics, biology, mathematics, chemistry, engineering and computer science, who also understand the application of these disciplines to the detection, diagnosis and assessment of treatment of disease. While the focus of this training program is the UCLA Physics and Biology in Medicine (formerly Biomedical Physics) Interdepartmental Graduate Program, the training program is not limited to the traditional practice of Medical Physics and is much broader in scope. This training program has four tracks. The Medical Imaging track investigates the physics of diagnostic radiology modalities (e.g. MRI, MR Spectroscopy, CT) and Computer Vision methods to investigate areas such as quantitative imaging, imaging biomarkers and Radiomics (as well as correlation with genomic factors – Imaging Genomics) all of which seek to extract additional information from image data and relate it to other key information about patients and disease. The Molecular Imaging track investigates a wide range of topics including the physics of PET, optical and combined imaging modalities, immuno-PET, the chemistry and biology of novel imaging tracers, microfluidics, nanotechnology and others all focused on providing investigations of basic biological mechanisms, both normal and pathological. This includes investigations with applications in oncology (including responses to immunotherapies), traumatic brain injury, neurodegeneration and other conditions. The Molecular and Cellular Oncology track investigates the molecular, cellular, and tissue-related effects of radiation. This also includes a wide range of topics from Radiation Genomics (Radiogenomics) which explores genetic components of both radiation sensitivity and radiation resistance, the role of the immune system in response to radiation, cancer stem cells and radiation response as well as signal transduction pathways and their influence on radiation response. The Therapeutic Medical Physics track investigates novel approaches to treatment delivery systems including methods to improve the accuracy of treatment delivery such as breathing motion models for real time MRI guided treatment delivery to 4π treatment methods and brachytherapy. This program has been training primarily Ph.D. students for more than 60 years (40 years with this training grant), and is unique in that it brings together researchers from basic sciences with investigators in the clinical translational sciences and physicians who are truly clinical researchers, all in a common environment dedicated to bringing basic research to clinical applications. This program has the faculty, students, infrastructure and backing of its supporting Departments (Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Radiological Sciences and Radiation Oncology) as well as the newly formed Graduate Programs in Biosciences to continue to achieve its goals of training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE This training grant aims to continue to develop research scientists that are well versed in physics, biology, mathematics, chemistry, engineering and computer science, who also understand the application of these disciplines to the instruments and techniques used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of disease as well as research fields that help us understand basic mechanisms of disease. These scientists will become actively involved in research into new methods that seek earlier diagnosis of disease as well as more specific (patient specific, disease specific) treatments of disease in many clinical applications.",Physics and Biology in Medicine Research Training,9973216,T32EB002101,"['Biology', 'Medicine', 'Physics', 'Research Training']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,T32,2020,266119,0.09251621091400014
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10006915,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,231500,0.05842598216071917

"Pipelines into Quantitative Aging Research Project Summary It is well documented that a diverse workforce has the potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities, which have strong effects in aging populations1-3. As the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. population increases, including among the aged population, the public health workforce should reflect this diversity1,4,5. With an increase in undergraduate public health majors across the country6,7, due in part to heightened excitement and opportunities in data science and quantitative big data analysis, and with breakthroughs in the science of aging on the horizon, this is an opportune moment to develop strong pipeline programs for underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates. We will target URM undergraduates who have quantitative and computational interests and expose them to opportunities for graduate study and research careers, and the possibilities and excitement of marrying their quantitative interests with substantive research in aging. Introducing undergraduates, who are more diverse in public health majors than other majors7, and than graduate students6, to careers in public health, holds much promise for increasing the diversity of graduate students and faculty in the field, which has increased very little in the past 20 years6. This holds for the MSTEM subfields of public health, such as Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Data Science, as well. Motivated by these factors, and in response to NIA Funding Opportunity (PAR-17-290), “MSTEM: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate Education (R25),” we propose an intensive, six-week summer program for 12 undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds with interests in Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Data Science and other quantitative methods to learn about the applications of these methods in aging research. The summer program includes formal instruction, a broad lecture series, mentored research projects, oral research presentation at an annual symposium, career and professional development sessions, site visits to labs and other research settings, group and informal mentoring, social activities and network building, and training in responsible conduct of research. To reinforce the intensive summer experience, we will continue to offer group and individual mentoring and research experiences into the following academic years. Additionally, we will offer a select group of summer program participants the opportunity to return to NYU during the January term for an extended research experience and a quantitative course. With the guidance of a professional evaluator and internal and external advisory committees, we will evaluate all aspects of our program and review results in real-time to enable constant adjustment and improvement. Our proposal addresses three critical needs to strengthen and galvanize the research enterprise in the field of aging: increased engagement of MSTEM experts, increased engagement of URM researchers, and increased attention to disparities. We believe that our intensive and long-term programmatic components will support the entry of talented URM students into successful careers in MSTEM research in aging. Project Narrative The goal of this R25 program is to increase the participation of underrepresented minority groups in the fields of Biostatistics and quantitative Public Health, with a collaborative focus on the diseases and processes of aging. The program includes an intensive six-week summer program for 12 students, with formal and informal instruction, mentored research, and extensive professional development activities, with a culminating symposium. For lasting impact, follow-up mentoring, continuing research and professional development will occur on a regular basis, both via webcast platforms and return, in-person visits.",Pipelines into Quantitative Aging Research,10024768,R25AG067931,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Attention', 'Autopsy', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Career Choice', 'Community Networks', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Diverse Workforce', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding Opportunities', 'GRE Preparation', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Program Reviews', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Site Visit', 'Statistical Computing', 'Students', 'Talents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Visit', 'aging population', 'biomarker selection', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'faculty mentor', 'follow-up', 'graduate student', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'minority undergraduate', 'posters', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'student mentoring', 'summer program', 'symposium', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R25,2020,367149,0.04708042196429678
"Patient Oriented Research and Mentorship and Training in Functional Neuroimaging of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ABSTRACT  This K24 Mid-Career Investigator Career Development Award seeks support for training and mentorship for Christopher Pittenger, MD, Ph.D., a well-established, tenured Associate Professor in Psychiatry at Yale University, Director of the Yale OCD Research Clinic, and Assistant Chair for Translational Research in the Department of Psychiatry. Dr. Pittenger leads a robust patient-oriented research (POR) research program, which is integrated with his basic/translational lab-based research and has produced important new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings and novel treatment avenues for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). Dr. Pittenger has a long-standing commitment to mentorship; most notably, he is Co-Director of the Neuroscience Research Training Program (NRTP), the research track within the Yale psychiatry residency.  The training plan supported by this grant will allow Dr. Pittenger to increase his skills in quantitative analysis, with a focus on advanced statistical methods and on the design and analysis of fMRI studies. These are areas in which he already has active research with expert collaborators; the aim of the proposed training plan is to enhance his own proficiency to make him a more effective collaborator and mentor in these important domains. Additional training is focused on his own abilities as a mentor and leader, with the goal of increasing his efficacy in the management of his own research groups and in effective and individualized mentorship. These training activities will take place in the context of two NIMH- funded research studies. The first, R01 MH116038, is a recently funded grant on which Dr. Pittenger is co-PI with his close collaborator Alan Anticevic and deploys cutting-edge imaging technology and data analysis approaches to examine brain network connectivity parallels and predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy in OCD. The second, R01 MH100068, is a grant with collaborator Michelle Hampson that is developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a probe and potential treatment for OCD, with promising early results. These two exciting projects provide a fruitful vehicle for the proposed training in statistics and neuroimaging.  Dr. Pittenger will devote substantial time to mentoring under this award. One major focus will be the NRTP; the plan is for him to take over as Director of this program over the next few years, and to take the lead in the next resubmission of our T32 grant in 2022. Support of this increased mentorship effort is a second major motivation for the current application. Dr. Pittenger will also provide mentorship to students, postdocs, and junior faculty in his own research program and throughout the Department of Psychiatry  Together, these integrated plans for training, research, and mentorship will support a well-established mid-career investigator whose robust research program is producing important insights into the neurobiology and treatment of OCD and TS, and whose dedicated mentorship efforts are helping to establish a new generation of translationally grounded patient-oriented researchers in psychiatric neuroscience.
