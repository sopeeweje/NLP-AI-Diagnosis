"Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi- ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in- complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem- ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be- tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad- vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech- anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules. Narrative: The computational methodologies we develop will be applicable to a broad set of metalloen- zymes and proteins of biomedical relevance. In particular, we target fundamental mechanistic problems in enzymes that catalyze nucleic acids synthesis/modiﬁcation and lipid metabolism, since mutations in these en- zymes are implicated in numerous human diseases such as cancer, insulin resistance and diabetes. Although our project does not focus on design of drugs, the mechanistic insights into enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation will broaden strategies that can be used to target various enzymes of biomedical signiﬁcance.",Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation,10206585,R35GM141930,"['Active Sites', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Water', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'human disease', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'method development', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,295591
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data. The Reactome database and web site enable scientists, clinicians, researchers, students, and educators to find, organize, and utilize biological information to support data visualization, integration and analysis.",Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways,10111538,U41HG003751,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Applications Grants', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Readability', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'clinically significant', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'tool', 'web site']",NHGRI,ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,U41,2021,1354555
"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards. Results from these studies will contribute to the goal of understanding diseases, and the tools and resources will be made publically available for biomedical researchers.",Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core,10213202,U2CES030170,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Attributes of Chemicals', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Phase', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical property', 'chemical standard', 'comparative', 'computational chemistry', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'dark matter', 'dietary', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'quantum chemistry', 'small molecule libraries', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIEHS,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U2C,2021,981634
"Non-target analysis of maternal and cord blood samples: Advancing computational tools and discovering novel chemicals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Non-targeted analysis (NTA) provides a comprehensive approach to analyze environmental and biological samples for nearly all chemicals present. Despite the recent advancements in NTA, the number of confirmed chemicals with analytical standards remains fairly small compared to the number of detected features. There is, thus, a need to further develop computational tools to derive more chemical structures and leverage the full potential of HRMS. Enhancing our ability to derive more chemical structures will enable the discovery of new industrial chemicals that humans are exposed to, especially in critical windows of development, such as pregnancy. It will also enable the discovery of endogenously produced metabolites that may be related to biological outcomes of importance, such as preterm birth. The objective of my proposal is to develop novel computational methods to significantly advance our ability to analyze and interpret non-targeted analysis data from high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and apply them to study prenatal exposures to industrial chemicals and endogenous metabolites in a large cohort of pregnant women from Northern California. My proposal builds on my expertise in analytical and environmental chemistry and my current postdoctoral experience in computational chemistry and applications in human exposure. I seek additional training to develop and apply innovative computational methods to better characterize the human exposome and in particular the exposome of preterm birth. The contribution of my proposal will be two-fold: (1) developing novel computational structure-prediction algorithms for HRMS datasets based on MS data and physicochemical properties (equilibrium partition ratios between organic solvents and water, e.g., octanol/water, chlorobenzene/water, diethyl ether/water etc.) (Aim 1) and apply them to derive potential structures for chemical features detected in a HRMS dataset from 340 maternal and 340 matched cord blood samples to complement the limited number of chemicals identified through MS/MS and analytical standards (Aim 2); and (2) study the interplay between the exposome and the metabolome in preterm birth using molecular interaction networks to visualize and compare how molecular interactions between industrial chemicals and endogenous metabolites differ between preterm and full-term birth (Aim 3). The K99 training will expand my prior research experience through coursework, research apprenticeship, and mentored reading, with specific training in: (1) advanced analytical skills including -omics data analysis, machine learning, and biostatistics; (2) epidemiology, risk assessment, human exposure to chemical stressors; and (3) human pregnancy and development. The skills acquired during this award are critical to my long-term goal to advance computational methods to better analyze and interpret non-targeted analysis data to support efforts to better characterize the human exposome. This work will produce new scientific knowledge to greatly advance the understanding of the influence of environmental exposures in the development of adverse health outcomes and in particular, preterm birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) offer unique opportunities to study the human exposome and the development of adverse health outcomes. Despite advances in non-targeted analysis, the number of confirmed chemicals remains fairly limited compared to the number of detected chemical features.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is to catalog all functional elements in the human genome through the integration and analysis of high-throughput data. We propose to continue the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, DAC) which will provide support and leadership in analyzing and integrating data from the ENCODE project as well as work closely with other ENCODE groups including the Data Coordination Center. Our proposed DAC team (Zhiping Weng, Mark Gerstein, Manolis Kellis, Roderic Guigo, Rafael Irizarry, X. Shirley Liu, Anshul Kundaje, and William Noble) has expertise across a wide range of fields including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, evolution, genomics and proteomics, regulatory RNA, biophysics, and computational biology, where they are the leaders in machine learning, statistical genetics, networks, and gene annotation. These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities. The proposed DAC will pursue the following four aims: Aim 1. Analyze and integrate data and metadata from a broad range of functional genomics projects; Aim 2. Serve as an informatics resource by supporting the activities of the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; Aim 3. Create high-quality Encyclopedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes; Aim 4. Assess quality and utility of the ENCODE data and provide feedback to NHGRI and the Consortium. RELEVANCE The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is a highly collaborative effort aiming to develop a comprehensive list of functional elements in the human genome. This proposal creates a data analysis center to provide support and computational prowess for this effort in collaboration with other ENCODE groups.

"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,10092924,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'rapid test', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2021,199831
"SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A  PROJECT SUMMARY  What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular, adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use. Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A PROJECT NARRATIVE  Beyond their traditionally known roles as carriers and regulators of genetic information, nucleic acids have auspiciously emerged as versatile therapies for taking advantage of cellular pathways to drive the sensing, targeting, and silencing of a variety of diseases. With MIRA support, we will explore additional nanotechnology- based therapeutic options that enlist a biocompatible nucleic acid-encoded platform (SMART NANPs) for the controlled immunostimulation and modulation of therapeutic responses. This research program aims to advance the envisioned technology towards personalized medicine and aid in addressing top public health challenges in the U.S. as they relate to cancer (through vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation), and drug overdose and safety (through the biodegradable nature of the platform and its functional regulation).",SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses,10086567,R35GM139587,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Biopolymers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncology', 'Overdose', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombin', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'clinical application', 'disability', 'genetic information', 'immunoregulation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'monocyte', 'nanoparticle', 'next generation', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE,R35,2021,141556
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,10167719,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,310328
"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we aim to bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This approach will bring statistical rigor to the ﬁeld of force ﬁeld construction and application by providing a means to make data-driven decisions, while enhancing reproducibility by enabling it to become a rigorous and reproducible science using a fully open infrastructure and datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life do their jobs. They also use simulations to help design new medications – compounds that can bind and inﬂuence the behavior of these molecules of life, and thereby block diseases at the molecular level. We aim to greatly increase the utility of all of these simulations by improving the accuracy of the formulas they use to compute the forces acting between atoms.",Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design,10105344,R01GM132386,"['Address', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Occupations', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biophysical model', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'data infrastructure', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'macromolecule', 'models and simulation', 'molecular mechanics', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleic acid-based therapeutics', 'open data', 'open source', 'physical model', 'physical property', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'small molecule', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,608856
"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. Using this novel integrative analytics approach, we propose to resolve the molecular basis for the development and recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus, a disease with significant public health importance, since it is a known precursor to a lethal esophageal cancer and the mechanisms underpinning this disease remain largely unknown. The findings from our proposed research will enable the development of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and will also inform preventive strategies in high-risk patient populations.",Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders,10086862,K25DK115904,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Columnar Epithelium', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Ephrins', 'Epithelial', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal Tissue', 'Esophagitis', 'Esophagus', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Squamous Epithelium', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'computer framework', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'in vivo Model', 'injury and repair', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'standard of care', 'stem cells', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational scientist', 'translational study']",NIDDK,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,171720
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,10144417,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dietary', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644301
"Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases The placenta is essential for fetal development and growth, maternal homeostasis, and broadly, pregnancy health. Yet, our ability to non-invasively probe placental health during human pregnancy is hampered by its deep intrauterine location and its highly vascular composition, rendering the placenta largely inaccessibly for safe and dynamic investigation. Whereas placental research has been advanced by cell culture, ex vivo systems, animal models, and postpartum analyses, these indirect approaches provide ex post facto information about placental health. Placental imaging has revolutionized the field of placental medicine, but resolution at the molecular, cellular, or metabolic level remains limited. To address these challenges, we and others have focused on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from placental trophoblasts, which, in humans, are directly bathed in maternal blood. We focused on exosomes (now termed small EVs or sEVs), microvesicles, and apoptotic blebs, which are continuously and abundantly released from trophoblasts into the maternal circulation and are accessible throughout pregnancy by peripheral blood tests. Among these EVs, we focus mainly on placental sEVs, which harbor messages that are seldom expressed by any other cell types and execute unique placental biological functions, such as an antiviral response. While informative, recent data indicate that sEVs are not a uniform population of vesicles, but comprise several subgroups, defined as large sEVs, small sEVs, and exomeres. In addition to their size, these sEV subtypes are characterized by distinctive cargo. Although the recent discovery of sEV subpopulations has excited researchers due to their potential to revolutionize the field of non-invasive diagnostics, sEV subpopulations have yet to be utilized in clinical settings. This is largely due to the difficulties associated with separation and isolation the nano-sized sEV subpopulations. Our group has now developed advanced acoustofluidic technologies designed to effectively, reproducibly, and rapidly isolate sEVs from blood. We show that we can separate placental sEVs into their specific subpopulations, which has not been previously accomplished. Our proposed investigation therefore focuses on the production of human placental sEV subpopulations, along with their RNA and proteome cargo. We posit that, by profiling these analytes from sEV subpopulations, we can illuminate a unique landscape of bioactive molecules that are relevant to placental health. To reduce data complexity, we propose a machine learning pipeline that will be used to probe the sub-sEV spectra during normal and pathological pregnancies. Further, we will improve our ability to purify sEV subpopulations from lipoproteins, and generate a single, integrated device that can reliably separate vesicles in real time across human gestation. We believe that our automated acoustofluidic approach to separating sEV subpopulations in a high-yield, biocompatible manner is critical to unlocking the clinical utility of sEVs. Insights gained from our investigation will improve non-invasive diagnostics during pregnancy and may uncover new targets for personalized placental therapeutics. Our proposal centers on the discovery and analysis of previously unrecognized nanovesicle subpopulations that are produced by placental cells and are released to the maternal-fetal circulation. By studying these nanovesicle subpopulations in health and diseases of human pregnancy and by innovating new technologies to efficiently, rapidly, and reproducibly purify these nanovesicles from the blood and other biological media, we enable pioneering tools to interrogate the placenta in real time and improve clinical care during pregnancy.",Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases,10099051,R01HD103727,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Response', 'Apoptotic', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bulla', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Field Flow Fractionation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Grant', 'Growth Factor', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Homeostasis', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lipoproteins', 'Location', 'MLLT2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuscripts', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Vesicle', 'Woman', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'first responder', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liquid biopsy', 'microvesicles', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanosized', 'nanovesicle', 'new technology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2021,542123
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community. Project Narrative – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) Understanding metabolism is relevant to find both markers and mechanisms of diseases and health phenotypes, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer.

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial.

We will then integrate this comprehensive phenotypic data into an ecosystem-based model to generate predictive biomarkers of pneumonia outcome for subsequent validation in a second cohort and tested for causality in a humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model.",Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center,10097970,U19AI135964,"['Acinetobacter', 'Address', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Alveolus', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bacterial Pneumonia', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'COVID-19', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Viruses', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fungal DNA', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte Subset', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection', 'RNA', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Study models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'Virulence', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data management', 'data pipeline', 'deep sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'hazard', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neural network', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'pneumonia model', 'pneumonia treatment', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'viral DNA', 'whole genome']",NIAID,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U19,2021,2280000
"Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to build mathematical models of human innate immune responses to the global pathogen influenza virus A (IAV). To ensure successful replication, viral pathogens must simultaneously hijack several components of the host cell machinery while either evading or disabling innate cellular defenses. The host genetic background and subsequent viral and host signaling interactions dictate disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to mortality. Recent studies of IAV in genetically diverse murine models confirm the critical role of genotype in host response and outcome. Both molecular targets as well as key proteins involved in IAV pathogenesis could be therapeutically exploited to attenuate or prevent disease. Thus, we construct models of the molecular networks driving early innate IAV response that can be used to model genetic effects. Our experimental system is human lung epithelium, the first-line of defense against and target of IAV.  Aim 1. Genetic predictions from the gene regulatory network (GRN) governing human epithelial IAV response. GRNs describe the control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). We showed that integrating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq improves GRN accuracy. To construct a dynamic GRN in our heterogeneous lung tissue model, we propose scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements of IAV infection and IFNβ stimulation time courses. Our group recently discovered new mechanisms by which the IAV protein Ns1 drives promoter-independent transcriptional “read-through” and alters 3D-chromatin architecture. Thus, for modeling, we also measure genomic transcription initiation and promoter-capture Hi-C. Following experimental testing and GRN refinement, we will use a deep-learning model trained on DNA sequence and epigenetic data to provide inputs that enable dynamic GRN simulations for thousands of human genotypes. We will identify genetic risk loci and molecular mechanisms driving difference in gene expression responses across individuals.  Aim 2. Model the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and cellular signaling networks driving the innate immune response to IAV. We developed mutant influenza viruses, each encoding a FLAG-tagged viral protein, while maintaining virulence in vivo. We will use the mutant IAV to map host-virus PPIs in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung in vivo. Integrating with diverse ‘omics datasets, we will construct a molecular network model connecting virus-host PPIs through cellular signaling pathways to IAV-dependent TFs. We will test pathway reconstruction with epistasis mapping.  Completion of both aims will lead to a GRN spanning virus-host PPIs and cellular signaling to TF control of gene expression in an innate-immune cell type. Our experimental-computational design is widely applicable. This model, and its future adaptation to other cells, will help identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving diverse human IAV responses and the network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human response to Influenza virus infection varies dramatically between individuals, from mildly symptomatic to death. We will systematically measure and model the innate immune response to IAV at the molecular network level: from host-virus protein-protein interactions through cellular signal transduction to changes in gene expression in human cells. The resulting mathematical model will help identify network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy and help predict differences in IAV response in the human population.",Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus,10240457,U01AI150748,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hi-C', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza A virus', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon-beta', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Population', 'Prize', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Training', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'adaptive immune response', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu', 'forest', 'global health', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenzavirus', 'mathematical model', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk variant', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF', 'transcription termination', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2021,1221095
"Meta-analysis in human brain mapping This is the competing renewal of the R01 (MH074457-14) which sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). BrainMap is a neuroimaging research resource facilitating cognitive neuroscience and disease-biomarker discovery via coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA). BrainMap provides its end-user community with: curated 3-D coordinate data and experimental metadata from peer-reviewed publications; extensively validated computational tools for CBMA; CBMA-derived tools for data interpretation (e.g., functional property and disease loadings by location) and data analysis (e.g., via CBMA-derived disease models); instructional materials and on-site and on-line venues for learning CBMA methods; and, on-going end-user support. At present, BrainMap.org hosts two coordinate-based databases: task-activation (TA DB) and voxel- based morphometry (VBM DB). A voxel-based physiology database (VBP DB) is in the planning and piloting phase. BrainMap maintains an integrated pipeline of cross-platform (Java) tools for data coding (Scribe), filtered retrieval (Sleuth), activation-likelihood estimation (ALE) CBMA (GingerALE), data visualization (Mango), and data interpretation (CBMA-derived Mango plugins). Multiple network-modeling approaches have been successfully applied to BrainMap data – independent components analysis (ICA), author-topic modeling (ATM), graph-theory modeling (GTM), structural equation modeling (SEM), connectivity-based parcellation (CBP), and meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) – but none are yet optimized and “pipelined” for general use. Utilization of BrainMap resources is substantial: our software, data and meta-data have been used in >1,000 peer-reviewed articles. Of these, > 500 were published in the current funding cycle (2015- 2020). Four aims are proposed, to maintain and extend this high-impact research resource.  Aim 1. Voxel-based Physiology DataBase (VBP DB) with Analysis Exemplars. Aim 2. BrainMap Community Portal for Multivariate Modeling with Applications & Exemplars. Aim 3. Large-scale Parameter Estimations. Aim 4. BrainMap Pipeline Enhancements and Community Support. The overall goal of the BrainMap Project is to provide the human neuroimaging community with curated data sets, metadata, computational tools, and related resources that enable coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), meta-data informed interpretation (“decoding”) of imaging results, and meta-analytic priors for mining (including machine learning) primary (per-subject) neuroimaging data.",Meta-analysis in human brain mapping,10157292,R01MH074457,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Brain Mapping', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Educational workshop', 'Equation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Java', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mango - dietary', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Site', 'Software Framework', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Texas', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'case control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'data submission', 'data tools', 'data visualization', 'design', 'experimental study', 'graph theory', 'hemodynamics', 'independent component analysis', 'learning materials', 'lectures', 'morphometry', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'simulation', 'webinar']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2021,637306
"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance.

"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This U24 application is written in response to RFA-AT-20-003 to establish a high-priority research network on emotional well-being (EWB). While psychological research on well-being has dramatically increased over the past 15 years, virtually all of this work has been descriptive and has not emphasized the “how” of well-being: How might well-being be cultivated? In addition, virtually all of the extant work on the correlates of individual differences in well-being has used responses on retrospective questionnaires as the primary tool to assess well-being. While there have been exciting findings, particularly relating individual differences in well-being to various indices of physical health, many questions remain and methodological limitations plague the validity of this work. This U24 network will assemble a highly multi-disciplinary group of 10 investigators across 3 (or more in the future) institutions to significantly advance our understanding of the “how” of EWB, identify the core plastic constituents of EWB, specify and/or develop robust measures of these constituents at biological, behavioral and experiential levels of analysis and characterize the plasticity of these constituents. The measurement strategy will ultimately focus on the development of technology-based passive measures of EWB that require no explicit user input and are highly scalable. The network will also focus its efforts on the development and evaluation of programs to train EWB and will assess whether such programs might serve as prevention strategies. The network will consist of scientists and scholars from a broad range of fields including psychology, neuroscience, electrical and computer engineering, population health and biology, computer science and the humanities. These scientists and scholars will focus on the following major aims: Aim 1: To arrive at a core consensus of the minimal set of constituents that can be described and measured at biological, behavioral and experiential levels that constitute the plastic elements of EWB and to specify already existing measures and /or develop novel measures of each of these constructs at each level of analysis. Aim 2: Using the active measures described in Aim 1, to develop passive measures using digital technologies of at least two of the core constituents of well-being. Aim 3: To develop pilot projects specifically focusing on prevention strategies for learning well-being in various samples. The network will train new investigators and bring established investigators into this new field, disseminate a framework for understanding the plasticity of well- being, a toolbox of measures for assessing the plasticity of components of well-being, and several pilot datasets that showcase the novel passive and field-friendly biological measures. In these ways, the network will dramatically accelerate progress in the nascent field of EWB. PROJECT NARRATIVE This U24 network on emotional well-being (EWB) will catalyze the emerging field of the plasticity of well-being and will showcase how well-being can be learned and the consequences of such skill development on physical and emotional health and on prevention of disease. A framework for understanding how well-being can be learned along with measures of the core components of well-being that can be learned will be developed and disseminated. The network will also train new investigators in this area and will engage established investigators to contribute to this field.","The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing",10151850,U24AT011289,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cellular Phone', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Drug abuse', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Humanities', 'Individual Differences', 'Institution', 'Interruption', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Population Biology', 'Prevention strategy', 'Program Evaluation', 'Psychology', 'Publications', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Well in self', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mindfulness meditation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'skill acquisition', 'social', 'standard measure', 'technology development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web site']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U24,2021,30000
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us.

"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,10146388,R21ES031740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemically Induced Toxicity', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Wildfire', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'biomass smoke', 'computational toxicology', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data repository', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'male', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoke inhalation', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,190241
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biologicalpathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified  targeted for further analyses in placental growth and maturity and future prospective clinical studies.        PROJECT NARRATIVE    The normal development of the placental is essential for optimal pregnancy outcomes, and understanding normal  and  pathological  placental  development  will  allow  new  opportunities  to  prevent  major  public  health  concerns  such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. This work will seek to develop new, non-­ invasive  strategies  to  monitor  human  placental  maturation,  reflecting  normal  development,  against  which  deviations can be determined earlier in pregnancy for more effective interventions.   ","Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems

"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,10107666,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,585186
"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering. Project Narrative The research objective of this proposal is to measure, model and predict the mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi at the molecular and continuum length scales.

"Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals ABSTRACT While multidrug-resistance transporters including P-gp and MRP2 are generally studied for their role in exporting drugs and foreign compounds from the cell, our studies indicate that these efflux pumps expressed at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells provide a critical link in communication between sentinel functions of mucosal barriers and the immune system. Understanding how this P-gp/eCB anti-inflammatory arm is regulated will provide crucial insight into how dysfunction may promote intestinal inflammation and help identify potential new therapeutic targets. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the central hypothesis we aim to test is whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to prevent unnecessary inflammation. Our pilot studies indicate that the microbiota does influence P-gp expression and function, providing a unique foundation for further cause-effect studies. No data have previously demonstrated a link between the microbiota and eCBs or any other epithelial lipid signals, and may well provide great insight into a novel system. Bridging this gap could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To begin addressing these questions, in Aim 1 of this application will combine in vitro (including human colonoids) and in vivo murine model systems, as well as use healthy and UC patient stool, to more deeply understand the microbial consortia that collectively maximize P-gp expression and function. Aim 2 is designed to identify the microbial metabolites that drive activation of P-gp expression and eCB secretion to maintain an anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses will be performed to provide new information regarding microbial genes, gene clusters, and their metabolic products implicated in maintaining an anti- inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium through regulation of the P-gp/eCB axis. In Aim 3 we will employ novel computational methods will to uncover the inter-microbial network responses and the ecological structure of a stable community that is able to induce P-gp expression. Collectively, knowledge of the pathways that coordinate the maintenance of the P-gp/eCB axis will require a comprehensive understanding of distinct signals regulating intestinal homeostasis, how multiple signals are integrated in the complex intestinal environment, and pathways that modulate host-microbe interactions. Consequently, this proposal will directly advance novel biological principles with guidance of new therapeutic intervention strategies. Public Health Narrative Regulated recruitment and migration of acute inflammatory cells termed neutrophils (PMN) into the intestine and across the specialized epithelium that lines it is critical for host defense, yet dysregulation of this process is associated with disease. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the goal of this proposal will examine whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to maintain a homeostatic anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Understanding this process could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals,10212384,R01DK125407,"['ABCB1 gene', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Apical', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Colitis', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethanolamines', 'Eubacterium', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Knowledge', 'Lactobacillus', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Submucosa', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Work', 'Xenobiotic Metabolism', 'arm', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'commensal bacteria', 'design', 'efflux pump', 'first responder', 'healing', 'host colonization', 'host-microbe interactions', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innate immune mechanisms', 'insight', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal homeostasis', 'mathematical model', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'normal microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'nuclear factor 1', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'theories', 'transcriptomics']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,560048
"Metabolic Basis of Bacterial Community Function in the Cystic Fibrosis Airway Abstract. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease characterized by overproduction of mucus in the lungs followed by chronic lung infections. Conventional wisdom has been that most CF lung infections involve a single dominant organism, most commonly the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Advances in culture-independent techniques have revealed that CF lung infections are rarely mono-microbial and instead usually involve complex microbial communities, yet the interspecies interactions that drive these communities are poorly understood. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that polymicrobial infections are more difficult than mono-microbial infections to eradicate with antibiotics, leading to the concept of recalcitrant communities. The mechanisms underlying recalcitrance are thought to involve synergistic interactions between community members, but very little data are available to understand this phenomenon. Combined with the realization that many CF patients respond poorly to available antibiotic regimens compels a more detailed understanding of interspecies interactions and their impacts on antibiotic recalcitrance to improve the treatment of CF infections, as well as other polymicrobial diseases. Here, we combine big-data bioinformatics, in silico computational modeling and in vitro culture experiments to gain insights into the metabolic interactions that drive CF disease outcomes and antibiotic recalcitrance. The research will leverage an available data set of hundreds of CF patient samples that provide both bacterial composition data and clinical metadata, including measures of lung function. These samples will be clustered according to their measured compositions and metabolic capabilities predicted through computational metabolic modeling to test the hypothesis that the vast complexity of these many bacterial communities can be collapsed into a small number of model communities that capture most of the observed metabolic variability. These computational predictions will be tested by developing in vitro cell culture models that recapitulate the most important metabolic features of the in vivo polymicrobial communities (Aim 1). By applying bioinformatics and modeling to the same clinical data, we will test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive disease outcomes and the virulence potential of these communities (Aim 2). Finally, we will interrogate the clinical data and in vitro communities to test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive antibiotic recalcitrance and differentiate community responsiveness to antibiotics according to these metabolic features (Aim 3). Our research will yield novel insights into how complex polymicrobial communities are compositionally structured, interact metabolically, contribute to disease and respond to antibiotics. Moreover, the research will validate in vitro models that offer the potential for development of novel antimicrobial strategies to better treat chronic, polymicrobial infections in CF and other diseases. Our transdisciplinary team offers the necessary expertise in bioinformatics, computational modeling, microbial physiology and CF polymicrobial infections to tackle this complex problem. Project Narrative: Infections associated with cystic fibrosis, and other polymicrobial infections, are still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,10224845,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2021,388750
"Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals PROJECT SUMMARY The transmission or ‘spillover’ of wildlife viruses to humans is a critical threat to global health, with outbreaks of viral pathogens like filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses all originating in wild mammals. A key outstanding question is whether specific taxonomic groups, such as bats, warrant extra surveillance as ‘special reservoirs’ of viruses that are potentially pathogenic to humans. However, existing host-virus datasets are not sufficiently resolved to predict fine-grain risk for species or genera. An effective response must therefore address two core aims: (i) synthesizing knowledge regarding virus-to-mammal interactions; and (ii) using that knowledgebase to robustly predict future spillover events (i.e., zoonotic risk). To enable robust analysis and reusability of public datasets of NIAID’s Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC; especially NCBI Virus and Virus Pathogen Resources, ViPR), the project will develop Host-Virus Data Intelligence to address three main problems for data reuse: confidence of the taxonomic assignments of mammals and viruses in observations; confidence in the evidence for proposed mammal-virus interactions; and connecting all the relevant data in published texts that are hidden from existing databases. The project team will construct a novel bioinformatic pipeline that will digitally connect taxonomic knowledge, use it to search dark data to find evidence of potential host-virus interactions, and then link it together using metadata layers (‘data about the data’) to form a more expansive host-virus knowledge graph than previously feasible. The project’s computational approach leverages information extraction methods in natural language processing as well as novel applications of artificial intelligence methods such as probabilistic inductive logic programming. A key anticipated outcome is to expand the dataset of host-virus interactions by 3-fold compared to comprehensive existing datasets. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a new generation of work reusing host-virus interaction data to test previously inaccessible hypotheses about how species’ traits impact viral spillover to humans. Shifting the paradigm to graph-based analyses, compared to purely taxonomic representations of host-virus interactions, will allow researchers to directly investigate the impact of ecosystem structure and human encroachment upon viral loads. Determining whether all mammals have equal risk of viral spillover, or whether some groups have higher taxon-specific zoonotic risk (e.g., horseshoe bats, murid rodents), is critical information for public health workers and epidemiologists. More definitive risk quantification will also help researchers identify which ecophysiological adaptations predispose certain groups to tolerating more viruses, which may in turn lead to clinical treatments by modeling the immune responses of wild mammals. Filling the identified gaps in host-virus knowledge is therefore essential to aid the progress of zoonotic disease research in the wake of COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synthesizing scientific data about mammal-to-virus interactions is essential to predicting the risk of future events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The project overcomes major obstacles to full and accurate reuse of existing mammal-virus data by applying computational methods for unifying relevant but disconnected data from published sources. Anticipated results will triple available knowledge, opening the door for asking whether some mammals carry more viruses than others and why with unprecedented levels of precision.",Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals,10289637,R21AI164268,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Epidemiologist', 'Event', 'FAIR principles', 'Feces', 'Filovirus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immune response', 'Immunological Models', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Mammals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muridae', 'Names', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paramyxovirus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Services', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral reservoir', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'bioinformatics resource', 'data reuse', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge graph', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'prevent', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'surveillance study', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'virus host interaction']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2021,244519
"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,10159277,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,276700
"Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10405294,F32DC019030,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Food', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Palate', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Programmed Learning', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality Control', 'Recipe', 'Research', 'Research Technics', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'food science', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'skills', 'sound']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2021,2500
"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users, enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are reprogrammed in disease.  NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data, and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.  During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols. OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We are all familiar with some of the components of biological systems – DNA, proteins, cells, organs, individuals – but understanding biological systems involves more than just cataloging its component parts. It is critical to understand the many interactions of these parts within systems, and how these systems give rise to biological functions and responses and determine states of health and disease.

"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,10017215,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Restriction-Modification Enzymes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,638466
"A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning SUMMARY Adaptive evolution (AE) is both a “force of good” as it can help to optimize biological processes in industry, but it is also a “force of frustration” when infectious diseases exploit AE to escape the host immune system or become resistant to drugs. It has long been assumed close to impossible to make predictions on AE due to the presumed predominating influences of random forces and events. However, the observation that evolutionary repeatability across traits and species is far more common than previously thought, suggests that AE, with the right data and approach, may become (partially) predictable. Indeed, we found through experiments with the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae on its response to antibiotics and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, that in order to make AE predictable a detailed understanding of at least two aspects of the bacterial system are required: 1.) the genetic constraints of the system (i.e. the architecture of the organismal network); and 2.) where and how in the system stress is experienced and processed. We showed that by mapping out ~25% of the bacterium's network, determining phenotypic and transcriptional antibiotic responses, applying network analyses to capture and quantify the responses in a network context, and exploiting experimental evolution to pin-point adaptive mutations in the genome it becomes possible, by means of machine learning, to uncover hidden patterns in the data that make AE predictions feasible. This means that the network in interaction with the environment shapes the adaptive landscape, it limits available solutions and makes some solutions more likely than others, thereby driving repeatability and enabling predictability. In this proposal we build on these exciting developments with the goal to map out the constraints of S. pneumoniae's entire network and develop a machine learning model that can forecast adaptive evolution a priori, and on a genome-wide scale. To accomplish this, we combine in aim 1 parts of Tn-Seq, dTn-Seq and Drop-Seq to finalize a new tool Tn-Seq^2 (Tn-Seq squared) that is able to map genetic-interactions in high-throughput and genome-wide. We use Tn-Seq^2 to reconstruct the first genome-wide genetic interaction network for S. pneumoniae in the presence of 20 antibiotics. In aim 2 we create 85 HA-tagged Transcription factor induction (TFI) strains and: a) Determine with ChIP-Seq the DNA-binding sites for all 85 TFs in S. pneumoniae; b) By overexpressing each TFI strain followed by RNA- Seq we determine each TFs regulatory signature; c) Use a Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype screen in the presence of 20 antibiotics to untangle environment specific links between genetic and transcriptional perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes. Lastly, in aim 3, we train and test a variety of machine learning approaches to design an optimal model that predicts which genes in the genome are most likely to adapt in the presence of a specific antibiotic. The development of this predictive AE model, will not only be useful in predicting the emergence of antibiotic resistance, but the strategy should be valuable for most any biological field for which adaptive changes are important, ranging from biological engineering to cancer. NARRATIVE Adaptive evolution (AE) is the driving force behind the emergence of antibiotic resistance and if it were possible to predict AE before it happens, it could help in preventing resistance. Here we use cutting-edge existing and newly designed genomics tools and analytical approaches to develop a machine learning model that can predict AE a priori, and on a genome-wide scale.",A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning,10155396,R01AI148470,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomass', 'ChIP-seq', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Fermentation', 'Frustration', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Industry', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photosynthesis', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Shapes', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Yeasts', 'design', 'driving force', 'droplet sequencing', 'emerging antibiotic resistance', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIAID,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2021,391250
"Unified Computation Tools for Natural Products Research Summary The overarching goal for this proposed renewal application will be to further advance tools that are in development and to effectively integrate several types of analytical data with biological assay data and genomic information. This will create a powerful set of tools for faster and even more accurate identification of new molecules, dereplication of known ones, and to directly infer biological activities from spectroscopic information. In the current period of support, we have made substantial progress in developing highly useful tools for automatic annotations and identifications of organic molecules, specifically focused on natural products. The Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking analysis and knowledge dissemination ecosystem has processed almost 160,000 jobs in nearly 160 countries worldwide, has 4-6,000 new job submissions per month and is accessed over 200,000 times a month (majority accessions are for reference library access, inspection of public data and previous jobs that the community shares as hyperlinks in papers), and has become a mainstream tool for the annotation of organic molecules deriving from diverse sources, especially in metabolomics workflows. The public website for Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART), a deep learning model for providing candidate structures based on 1H-13C HSQC NMR data, went live in December 2019 and already has over 3000 jobs in 50 countries. All tools developed in this proposal will become part of this analysis ecosystem. The four laboratories contributing to this proposed research activity have created an open and integrated team that is continuing to creatively innovate new informatic tools to enhance small molecule structure annotations and inference of their chemical and biological properties. We have four specific aims: 1) To complete the development and evaluation of a set of new and innovative tools for natural products analysis, and deploy these as freely available resources for the worldwide community. 2) To refine the structural characterization of molecules through leveraging repository scale mass spectral information along with NMR data and genomic inputs. 3) To create a new SMART-based tool that integrates mass spectrometry and HSQC NMR data as the input for a new deep learning system with the goal of achieving more accurate predictions of structure. 4) To use deep learning to enhance SMART with bioactivity data so as to enable SMART to predict activities of molecules based on spectroscopic features. The data will also augment the GNPS database with biological assay binding data. An additional consequence of these goals will be the further digitization of natural products analytical data so that they can be used in the computational tools planned herein, as well as other tools in the future. Completion of these four specific aims will create new integrated tools for the precise identification of new natural product structures, and enable inference of their structural relatedness to other classes of organic molecules and their biological properties. Thus, these new informatic tools will have the potential to greatly enhance the small molecule drug discovery process.         Unified Computational Tools for Natural Products Research Approximately 50% of all FDA approved drugs trace their origins to natural products, either directly or through indirect routes of development.

"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,10063532,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effectiveness testing', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,360227
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10264175,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutically effective', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2021,521758
"Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function Project Summary mRNA degradation is an essential process in post-translational gene regulation, and influences protein expression levels in cells. In S. cerevisea the lifetime of mRNA ranges from 43 sec to 39 min, with a median half-life of 3.6 min. The molecular factors governing these differential degradation rates has long been an area of active research. Recently though, clear evidence has emerged that the codon optimality correlates with half- lives. At a mechanistic level, the emerging perspective is that some transcripts are translated quickly, and some slowly, and that transcripts in which ribosomes end up forming queues, much like a traffic jam of cars on a highway, are recognized by ubiquitin ligases such as Hel2 that trigger the RQC pathway to promote mRNA degradation. There are two major gaps in this field. The first is the capability to predict mRNA half-lives accurately from mRNA sequence features. The second is understanding at the molecular level how the distribution of codon translation speeds along a transcript’s coding sequence promote ribosome queues and hence degradation. In this proposal, a graduate student will combine the PI’s labs expertise in modeling the kinetics of translation and ribosome traffic with interpretable machine learning techniques to address these two gaps. In achieving this, the field will be advanced by having both predictive and explanatory models for how translation speed and codon usage differentially impacts the degradation rates of different mRNAs. Specifically, our first aim is to build an interpretable machine learning model to identify robust and predictive features governing mRNA degradation. Our second aim is to explain at the molecular level why these features influence degradation rates. We will do this in two ways. First, we will use the essential and predictive features resulting from the interpretable machine learning model to identify potential underlying mechanisms contributing to degradation. Second, we will simulate the movement of ribosomes on each transcript based on reported initiation and elongation rates to detect ribosome queues and provide an explanation for differential degradation rates. Finally, our third aim is to test the predictions coming from the models. For example, do the models from Aim 1 accurately predict mRNA half-lives when synonymous mutations are introduced? There is sufficient published data on transcriptome-wide mRNA half-lives on S. cerevisiae to train and test the machine learning models in Aim 1. Further, we have arranged for a machine learning expert to co-advise the graduate student on the second aim. This co-advisor is already a collaborator of the PI on other machine learning projects. Finally, a collaborator who has measured mRNA half-lives will further advise the student on the third aim. In summary, this training supplement will address cutting edge questions in the molecular biology and biophysics of mRNA lifetimes and provide the student the opportunity to get advanced training and expertise in machine learning, molecular modeling, and experimental techniques. Project Narrative Messenger RNA (mRNA) half-lives are influenced by the rate of protein synthesis and the ribosome traffic jams that can form on transcripts when slow-translating codons are encountered by ribosomes. The complex distribution of codon usage across transcripts, and the interplay of initiation and elongation rates that can create ribosome queues make it difficult to predict an mRNA's half-life based on its sequence. Here, we will apply machine learning to accurately predict mRNA half-lives from sequence, and combine it with biophysical modeling to understand the molecular events regulating mRNA degradation.",Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function,10307359,R35GM124818,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Half-Life', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Speed', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'graduate student', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'models and simulation', 'molecular modeling', 'protein expression', 'protein structure function', 'ribosome profiling', 'simulation', 'transcriptome', 'ubiquitin ligase']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R35,2021,31246
"Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this proposal is to conduct the first multi-omics translational study of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), thereby identifying the systems-level networks driving pathological processes in this rare, autoimmune liver disease. Improved understanding of PBC pathogenesis is urgently needed to inform tailored care and the development of new effective therapies. Comprehensive assessments of immunity and the role of environmental influence in PBC are currently lacking. Such evaluations would provide critical knowledge to leverage recent advances in the field’s ability to pharmacologically alter the immune system, thereby providing new hope to PBC patients. Having made significant contributions to the understanding of the genomic architecture underlying development of autoimmunity in PBC, we propose a novel, patient-oriented, multi- omics approach. In this new application, we will decipher how peripheral cellular immunity and non-cellular circulating factors contribute to PBC pathogenesis. We hypothesize that multi-omic analyses integrating cellular and non-cellular factors will identify systems-level pathways driving PBC pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we develop an innovative platform that combines aspects of machine learning and quantum statistical mechanics to identify omics-based signatures of PBC that when integrated with clinical features will unveil biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis.  To perform this multi-omic study of PBC, we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team synergizing expertise in PBC biology and omics-scale analytics as well as resources across Mayo Clinic and Columbia University. With a new, in-hand collection of diverse biological specimens from 300 deeply- phenotyped PBC patients and 300 well-matched controls, our studies are already underway with preliminary data demonstrating measureable immunome, methylome, inflammatory protein, exposome, and metabolome differences between PBC patients and controls. In Aim 1, we thoroughly evaluate peripheral immune composition (the immunome) and activation state (methylome, transcriptome, inflammatory proteins) using mass-cytometry (CyTOF), sequencing- and proximity extension-based methods. In Aim 2, we perform a cutting-edge study of exogenous chemicals “the exposome” and endogenous metabolites “the metabolome” using ultrahigh resolution mass spectroscopy to discover pathogenic alterations in metabolism in PBC. We also develop an assay to quantify liver-specific cell-free DNA in blood as a measure of disease severity. In Aim 3, we integrate omic-specific signatures (Aims 1 and 2) using a novel approach to identify and prioritize PBC- associated features for further biological investigation. We then infer clinically-relevant subgroups of PBC patients by performing similarity network fusion analysis. In summary, using state-of-the-art, multi-omic analyses, we will discover systems-level networks driving PBC pathogenesis, spurring development of new hypotheses and studies designed to elucidate PBC pathobiology and identify novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will conduct the first multi-omics translational study of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), to improve understanding of the culprits driving this rare, autoimmune liver disease. By integrating multiple layers of omics data, we will better define the architecture of cellular networks driving PBC. In so doing, we will identify molecular signatures including immune alterations, environmental toxins, and metabolism-related chemicals unique to PBC patients, thereby spurring improved understanding of PBC pathobiology and identification of novel druggable targets.",Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis,10095117,R01DK126691,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Heel', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary biliary cirrhosis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell free DNA', 'clinically relevant', 'combinatorial', 'effective therapy', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'quantum', 'response', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,628683
"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data. The primary deliverable of this project will be a publically-accessible, web-based search engine to evaluate new chemicals for risk of hepatotoxicity.",Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity,10166848,R01ES031080,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Antioxidants', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cryopreservation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Costs', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nutraceutical', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'PubChem', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'cell injury', 'combat', 'computational toxicology', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'hepatocellular injury', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'liver injury', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'reproductive toxicity', 'research clinical testing', 'safety assessment', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'search engine', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIEHS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ CAMDEN,R01,2021,457521
"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10165490,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,528873
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems.

"CSHL Network Biology Conference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks support for the conference on Network Biology, to take place March/April 2021 to 2025, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). This meeting, held in biannual rotation on the CSHL campus in New York, brings together senior and junior scientists from both experimental and computational laboratories with common interests in network biology. The meeting will emphasize new discoveries and provide an open forum for the presentation of the latest research and results on molecular networks and their relevance to normal and abnormal cellular physiology. It will be essential for advancing knowledge in all aspects of the network modeling process, from data generation in experimental cell biology to data analysis and computer simulation and from the development and validation of network models describing these data to biological inferences made from the models. The conference will include platform sessions on interaction networks, signaling and network dynamics, regulatory networks, computational tools, artificial intelligence and big data, multi-scale networks, networks and disease, networks in differentiation, microbiome networks, network evolution, synthetic networks, network engineering and networks beyond biology though the exact program for the meeting will be assembled after the abstract submission deadline in February 2021 and adapted to ongoing developments in the field in subsequent years. This conference will include significant components designed to facilitate the active participation of younger scientists such as selection of platform speakers on the basis of the scientific merit of their submitted abstracts as well as poster presentations, round tables, lightning talks and poster prizes. Distinguished speakers will also be invited to give platform talks and interact with more junior scientists. The intimate environment at CSHL fosters social interactions and active participation by all. The majority of participants to the previous CSHL Network Biology meeting expressed that they were “very satisfied”. Speakers' panels have consisted of at least 50% women; the gender balance will be maintained in future meetings. In the 2019 iteration of the meeting, a panel discussion was established to address the challenges of Women in Network Science. We will continue to address big community challenges though panel discussions in this meeting. In 2021, we will discuss Applicability and Translatability of Network Biology with panelists including network biologists whose work is deeply influential throughout the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biological systems are functionally and structurally formed by complex networks of interacting molecular components, many of which are encoded in the genome. Elucidating the structure and function of these networks and understanding how their dysregulation causes disease are critical steps toward improving human health. This application seeks support for the conference on Network Biology to be held every two years in March/April 2021-25 at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, to bring together experimental and computational biologists and discuss emerging trends and latest results in the field.",CSHL Network Biology Conference,10137390,R13HG011550,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular biology', 'Chalk', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Human', 'Industrialization', 'Influentials', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Lightning', 'Methodology', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nationalities', 'New York', 'Normal Cell', 'Organism', 'Participant', 'Plants', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prize', 'Process', 'Property', 'Published Comment', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rotation', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'career', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data exchange', 'data reuse', 'design', 'graduate student', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'meetings', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'posters', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'senior faculty', 'social', 'symposium', 'trend', 'unpublished works']",NHGRI,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R13,2021,3000
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,10109124,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'data analysis pipeline', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,314000
"Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome PROJECT SUMMARY Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome Hippocrates said ~2,400 years ago: “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”. It is now well known that this is largely due to the “diet-microbiota-host” interactions that happen in the human gut. In particular, microbial degradation of carbohydrates can produce a variety of metabolites, which have a profound impact on human health. As a bioinformatics researcher in the Nebraska Food for Health Center, the long-term interests of the PI include: (i) develop specialized computational tools for better functional annotation of food-digesting microbial genomes and metagenomes, and (ii) characterize enzymes and other genetic elements that connect microbes, diets, and human health. The objective of this R01 project is to develop a suite of bioinformatics tools for functional annotation of carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) and CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) in human gut microbiome. The PI has over 10 years of experience in CAZyme bioinformatics tool development, and maintains a well-recognized CAZyme annotation database and web server called dbCAN (http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2). This project aims to further dbCAN development to address fundamental personalized nutrition questions: (i) is a gut microbe able to utilize a specific type of glycan? (ii) can a person carrying certain gut microbes respond to an individualized diet (e.g., prebiotics: dietary compounds that are beneficial to human health)? To address these questions, new CAZyme annotation tools must have the ability to predict the carbohydrate substrates of CAZymes. Recent research has found that different CAZyme encoding genes are often co-localized with each other and with other genes (e.g., those encoding sugar transporters, regulators, and signaling proteins) in bacterial genomes to form CGCs (also known as polysaccharide utilization loci or PULs). Thus, the foundation of the new tool development is that the gene membership (or functional domain composition) of a CGC can be used to predict its carbohydrate substrates (e.g., xylans, pectins, glucans, etc.). The innovation is that machine learning approaches will be used to analyze a large number of experimentally characterized PULs curated from literature, and the extracted sequence features will be used to build effective classifiers to predict and classify CGCs in new genomes/metagenomes. The expected outcome will be novel and user-friendly open source computer programs, databases, and web servers that allow automated CGCs identification and substrate predictions. The significance is that the new tools will facilitate the experimental characterization of more PULs and their carbohydrate substrates in human gut microbiome (also in other carbohydrate rich environments). Therefore, this project will contribute computational solutions to the research of personalized nutrition, e.g., analyze a person's gut microbiome to predict if this person can respond to diets containing certain prebiotic glycans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human gut microbes primarily feed on carbohydrate substrates derived from diet and host, and produce important metabolites that significantly influence host physiology and health. The functional annotation of the carbohydrate metabolic enzyme repertoire of gut microbes is poorly defined for most bacterial phyla, resulting in gaps in understanding of how microbial communities utilize these carbohydrates to influence human health. Creating new bioinformatics tools for predicting carbohydrate utilization will contribute to the arising microbiome-based personalized nutrition practice and aid in the development of therapeutic options to prevent/treat human metabolic disorders.",Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome,10099567,R01GM140370,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteroidetes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Carbohydrates', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Family', 'Firmicutes', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucans', 'Glycosides', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mannans', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Microbe', 'Nebraska', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Pectins', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Polysaccharides', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Signaling Protein', 'Starch', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'Xylans', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dietary', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'host microbiota', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'metagenome', 'metatranscriptome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'microbiome sequencing', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'open source', 'prebiotics', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'web server']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,R01,2021,302120
"Integrating Biology into In Silico Methodologies: Modern approaches for incorporating biological reasoning and understanding into computational methods. 1 This proposal is for PA-18-648, NIH Support for Conferences and Scientific Meetings –  2 funding intended to help finance a two-day standalone “SOT CCT” workshop titled Integrating  3 Biology into In Silico Methodologies: Modern Approaches for incorporating biological  4 reasoning and understanding into computational methods. As a “Contemporary Concepts  5 in Toxicology” meeting, this workshop has the full backing, including being financially  6 underwritten, by the Society of Toxicology.  7 Computational modeling is an important tool for assessing the safety and use of  8 chemicals across many industries, including chemical, pharmaceutical, and consumer products.  9 Moreover, in silico methodologies offer academia and regulatory a fast and cheap method of 10 prioritizing its efforts to maintain compliance and safety in the market and environment. 11 This conference is designed to promote the development of actionable insights and 12 methodologies for increasing the biological relevance of in silico solutions. Specifically, this 13 conference will focus on solving the “black box effect”. There are many ways to validate a 14 model’s accuracy and domain – however if the model cannot explain what is happening 15 biologically, its use is severely diminished. This workshop will bring together regulatory, 16 academia, industry, and service providers to discuss current solutions and efforts, as well as 17 ongoing and future research. One goal of this conference will be to develop a roadmap for the 18 incorporation of AOPs (and similar biological reasonings) for computational tools. 19 This workshop has great appeal for multiple stakeholders within toxicology, namely 20 industry, academia, regulators, as well as service providers. The use of machine-learning to 21 replace laboratory toxicological tests is paramount to the future of the industry (3Rs). The use 22 of in silico models are explicitly referenced by NICEATM’s U.S. Strategic Roadmap, as well as 23 TSCA. Moreover, many industries and regulatory entities are taking significant steps away from 24 animal testing. Most recently, the US EPA stated that it will eliminate animal testing by 2035. 25 This workshop will bring together different stakeholders to discuss the current state of 26 AOPs and in silico methodologies, and to work towards a unified approach for their 27 incorporation. The final outcome of the workshop will be a white-paper that not only reviews the 28 current landscape but discusses concretes steps, as outlined in the breakout session, needed 29 for the regulatory acceptance of machine learning technologies – specifically a roadmap for the 30 inclusion of AOPs into computational tools and explanations.

"Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises Project summary: Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems. This leads to at least 16 million cases of acute gastroenteritis directly linked to pollution at community water systems, with tens of millions more directly impacted by chemical and organic pollutants. Impacts are further exacerbated in locations dealing with water scarcity, in under-served populations, and within other vulnerable populations already suffering from health disparities. Many of these water problems are the direct result of managerial negligence, inconsistent monitoring, and a lack of the ability to anticipate where problems may arise next. While the reasons for drinking water problems are complex, if we could anticipate where health-based drinking water problems were to occur in the future, it could have an immediate and positive impact on tens of millions of Americans annually. Interestingly, extensive data about water quality and the performance of municipal water systems already exists in large, disparate databases. These databases are largely ignored and, when used, are typically used only anecdotally and retroactively. Preliminary evidence suggests that these existing databases, which contain histories of administrative violations and sub-threshold water-quality results, can be mined to accurately predict future drinking water crises. The Superior Statistical Research R&D team is an internationally recognized group of water experts with cross-cutting expertise in statistics/data analysis/modelling/computing, water-quality monitoring of biological and chemical contaminants, and the ability to clearly and compellingly translate water-quality and health information to actionable steps for individuals, organizations and communities. In this Phase I project, we will show that it is possible to predict water-related, health-based problem areas utilizing already collected, historical data on water quality and municipal water system performance. We will begin by harmonizing the disparate water quality and municipal water system performance in two different states (Michigan and Iowa). We will then utilize machine-learning techniques to predict health-based violation histories and will evaluate our methods by comparing predicted violations to actual health-based violations in the previous 5 years. Finally, we will identify at least 10 municipalities determined by our algorithm to be at the highest risk for future health- based water problems and will do systematic sampling to confirm our model-based predictions. We will then demonstrate how making these predictions can be leveraged to profitability by exploring how our model-based predictions can be presented to customers in an economical, usable form. Proof of our concept and profitability models in two states (Phase I) will set us up for widespread (multi-state) database harmonization and improvement of the proposed machine-learning/modelling effort in Phase II. With multi-state harmonized datasets, identification of key data gaps in particular states/areas, and proven financial models, our technology will ultimately lead to dramatic reductions in the number of health-based drinking water problems annually. Project Narrative Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems, but predicting where and when these health-based drinking water problems will occur remains a large and complex obstacle. Current approaches focus on a reactive approach to health-based water-quality violations in community water systems, rather than a proactive one that seeks to anticipate where problems will occur in the future. The overall goal of this project is to leverage large and disparate historical datasets of water quality to accurately predict locations of future health-based water-quality violations, validate the predictions, and commercialize our proprietary predictions as a practical and cost-saving approach to anticipating and heading off future health-based water problems.",Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises,10253600,R43ES033134,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Chemicals', 'Cities', 'Coal', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complex', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Filtration', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Lead', 'Lead levels', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Negligence', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pollution', 'Price', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Serinus', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Water', 'advocacy organizations', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'drinking water', 'economic impact', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'member', 'pollutant', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'rural area', 'statistics', 'water quality', 'water sampling', 'water testing', 'willingness to pay']",NIEHS,"SUPERIOR STATISTICAL RESEARCH, LLC",R43,2021,256579
