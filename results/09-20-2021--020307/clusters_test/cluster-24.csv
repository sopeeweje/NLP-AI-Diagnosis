"Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Su H. Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of all findings (aim 3). As Dr. Chu completes these aims, her career development program will facilitate the achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although a rich epidemiological literature has demonstrated a high comorbidity between asthma, the most common respiratory disease worldwide, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common behavioral disorder among children, with reports of significant increases in diagnoses in recent years, no studies have interrogated the potential molecular pathobiology underlying the mutual excess risk between asthma and ADHD. This proposal aims to use integrative techniques by combining genetic and metabolomic data to characterize common and distinct mechanisms and pathways of dysregulated metabolism in the presence of comorbid asthma and ADHD and to develop multiomic profiles which can assist in predicting higher risk of ADHD among asthmatic children. The findings from this study will be instrumental in understanding the molecular underpinnings of two highly prevalent public health concerns, and this study will be the first of its kind to interrogate the molecular intersections between asthma and ADHD.",Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity,10224338,K01HL153941,"['Achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Communication Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Formulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sphingolipids', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tryptophan', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'antenatal', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'biological systems', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'method development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychogenetics', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,178200
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in pediatric obese asthma.",Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility.,10063930,K08AI135091,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allergens', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Response', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interleukin-13', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'PD-1 pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Activation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Th2 Cells', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Weights and Measures', 'Work', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'antiviral immunity', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'dimensional analysis', 'drinking water', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pediatric patients', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational approach']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K08,2021,186948
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,10078271,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular emergency', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'detection limit', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,513804
"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden. This pilot is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self-management among adolescents with persistent asthma. Knowledge gained from this pilot study will be used to design and conduct a future efficacy trial of the app. This project addresses the mission of NHLBI by developing a novel intervention to treat asthma. This study leverages our formative and pilot work to continue making strides towards enhancing asthma control among adolescents with persistent asthma in order to reduce asthma-related morbidity.",Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents,10224318,R34HL145442,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Information System', 'Hispanics', 'Incentives', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Social Change', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age group', 'aged', 'arm', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient-clinician communication', 'peak flow measurement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R34,2021,256469
"IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  Asthma is a common disease, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Though well controlled in most, some experience disease that is refractory to standard treatments such as corticosteroids. Recent efforts focused on understanding these severe asthma (SA) patients suggests ontological heterogeneity. Previous work from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort linked epithelial gene signature to clinical phenotype. We revisited this data set and identified 3 novel groups of asthmatics, one of which housing the majority of SA cases and having the worst lung function and greatest exacerbation history. Using principal drivers of variance in the data set, we found that expression of the interleukin 18 receptor (IL18R1) along with 18 other genes was able identify at-risk asthmatics. IL18R1 has been previously linked to asthma in genome-wide association studies. Its ligand, interleukin-18 (IL-18), may be a cofactor for both Th1 and Th2 inflammation. High IL-18 levels have been detected in serum and sputum of asthmatics including in those with fatal asthma. Importantly, IL-18 and IL18R1 regulate epithelial barrier function in other inflammatory conditions. We have confirmed an increase in IL18R1 at the protein level in SA patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using lung biopsies from very severe asthma cases. These SA patients also harbor increased numbers IL-18+ cells, the cognate ligand for IL18R1. Downstream targets of IL18 stimulation, including the active phosphorylated forms of JNK1 and c-Jun, show increase in SA airway epithelium. SA patients also show disorganization of adherens junctions, suggesting breakdown in epithelial barrier integrity.  Based on this background and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that IL-18 pathway activation, via elevated IL18R1 expression in bronchial epithelium, promotes dysregulated barrier function that contributes to SA pathobiology by increasing immune cell access to foreign antigens. We propose 2 aims to address this: Aim 1. We will interrogate pre-existing tissue banks for quantitative analysis of IL18R1 and compare that with levels of its ligand in tissue and fluids from these patients. These data will be corroborated with activity of associated signaling pathways and tight/adherens junction integrity. Aim 2. We will us primary human airway epithelial cells, obtained bronchoscopically from HCs and asthmatic patients to mechanistically confirm and expand upon the results from Aim 1. This will include validation of ex vivo results as well as quantification of barrier function.  These data will identify a novel role for IL18 in severe asthma pathogenesis and open up new avenues for treatment of this difficult and costly disease. The activities of the project will provide the PI with valuable experience in obtaining, culturing and manipulating primary human airway epithelial cells and lay the foundation for future in vivo work by integrating study in computational biology and immunology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Severe asthma is disease with tremendous impact on patient quality of life and significant cost of treatment. We have used machine learning to identify the IL-18 pathway as a potential driver of this disease which may one day be targeted for novel treatments. Thus, we propose confirmation of these findings using an extensive ex vivo tissue collection as well as mechanistic validation using primary human airway epithelial cells to lay groundwork for future in vivo study.",IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma,10116175,F32HL147415,"['Address', 'Adherens Junction', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergens', 'Antigens', 'Asthma', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Computational Biology', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'E-Cadherin', 'Electrical Resistance', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'IL18 gene', 'Immune', 'Immunofluorescence Microscopy', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-18', 'JUN gene', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MAPK8 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sputum', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tight Junctions', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Transcription Factor AP-1', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'airway epithelium', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic airway', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'clinical phenotype', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genome wide association study', 'in vivo', 'interleukin-18 receptor', 'novel', 'occludin', 'p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'standard care', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2021,52121
"Clinical prediction and epigenetic regulation of asthma and rhinitis Asthma and rhinitis share a strong genetic component and are the most common chronic respiratory diseases worldwide affecting 339 million and 500 million people, respectively. Both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis are well-studied risk factors for the development of asthma, independent of atopy and IgE sensitization, and up to 80% of asthmatics have concomitant rhinitis. Conversely, asthma is also a risk factor for the development of rhinitis suggesting a common pathophysiological link between the upper and lower airways. Individuals with comorbid asthma and rhinitis are more likely to experience frequent and severe asthma exacerbations. Currently, an unmet need exists in the understanding of the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis, including which patients are at risk and why patients with comorbid disease have increased disease severity. microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important predictive biomarkers and regulators of the pathogenesis of asthma and rhinitis. However, the role of miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) regulatory networks in asthma with comorbid rhinitis is not known. The overall hypothesis of this K23 award proposal is that the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis can be predicted by clinical factors and is regulated by miRNA-mRNA networks. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the early childhood clinical prediction of the development of comorbid disease in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiology (BAMSE) cohorts and create a validated clinical prognostic tool to identify high-risk children who may benefit from early monitoring and interventions. Specific Aim 2 will identify the unique miRNA-mRNA pathways and regulatory networks in the peripheral blood that regulate asthma with comorbid rhinitis in children from the VDAART, BAMSE, and Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) cohorts to identify candidate miRNAs and biological pathways that may serve as future targets of miRNA-based therapies and biomarkers. Specific Aim 3 will prospectively validate the miRNA-mRNA signature of asthma with comorbid rhinitis across the peripheral whole blood and local nasal epithelium in subjects recruited from Brigham and Women’s Hospital to identify the shared and tissue-specific pathogenic pathways in the peripheral blood and local primary airway tissue. Through this K23 award proposal, the candidate will complete an integrated plan of mentorship, coursework, conferences, patient-oriented research, statistical and computational analyses, manuscript submissions, and R01 grant preparation. She will develop new knowledge and skills in clinical, translational, and computational research and generate new hypotheses and data that will provide the basis for future independent lines of investigation. With the support of her division, mentors, and scientific advisory committee and the resources available at her institution, the candidate is ideally positioned to achieve her goal of becoming a successful independent investigator in the epidemiology and epigenetics of asthma and allergic diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma and rhinitis frequently coexist and are the most common respiratory diseases globally, yet it remains unknown why these two diseases often develop concomitantly and why patients with comorbid disease have worse control of asthma symptoms and more frequent and severe asthma exacerbations.

"Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room Visits (SPACER) PROJECT ABSTRACT Asthma impacts more than 25 million adults and children in the U.S. with high associated morbidity and socioeconomic disparities in outcomes. Because effective medications are available to treat and prevent exacerbations of asthma and evidence-based interventions exist to mitigate the impact of harmful socioeconomic factors, early identification of those at highest risk is crucial. However, efforts to predict future exacerbations of asthma have yielded modest results with infrequent inclusion of comprehensive information on social hardships, such as food insecurity and housing instability, or financial hardships, such as difficulty affording the costs of controller medications which is particularly relevant for those with private health insurance. Identifying social and financial hardships requires broad-based screenings which are resource intensive, difficult to implement in clinical settings and often incomplete or limited to care seeking populations. Further, few asthma risk prediction modalities incorporate time-variable (temporal) data on important social, clinical, and environmental factors. Machine learning, an advanced computational approach to risk prediction, has great potential to improve upon conventional approaches to risk prediction of asthma exacerbations through indirect estimation of social hardships and inclusion of temporal risk factors. Implementation of enhanced asthma risk-prediction models in a health plan setting offers distinct advantages due to existing investments in asthma care management and access to timely claims data across the full care continuum. Accordingly, the aims of the SPACER study (Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room visits) are 1) To describe social and financial hardships in privately insured adults and children with asthma, and association with medication adherence and exacerbations, 2) To indirectly estimate self-reported social and financial hardships using routinely collected health plan and spatial data, and 3) To develop and validate a machine learning network model, incorporating temporal sociomarker, clinical, and environmental data, to predict asthma exacerbations in a health plan setting. The research leverages the unique research environment of the Department of Population Medicine, an academic research department of Harvard Medical School, situated in a regional non-profit health plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The mentored career development award will support Dr. Alon Peltz, a physician and health services researcher, in developing expertise in machine learning modeling and use of social data to improve prediction of adverse clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new methods for asthma risk prediction in a health plan setting by incorporating social and financial hardship data, temporal features, and machine learning. Applications of this research will directly enable U.S. health plans to better identify adults and children for enrollment in asthma care management programs in order to moderate their combined clinical and social risks for poor asthma quality. This career development award will support Dr. Alon Peltz, a physician health services researcher, in developing expertise in machine learning risk prediction incorporating expanded social data.",Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room Visits (SPACER),10099714,K23HL155425,"['Adult', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Early identification', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Face', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Public Policy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'care seeking', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'disparities in morbidity', 'experience', 'food insecurity', 'health plan', 'health record', 'high risk', 'housing instability', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'medication compliance', 'network models', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'relative cost', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'socioeconomic disparity']",NHLBI,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",K23,2021,169332
"Identification and characterization of children with asthma-associated comorbidities through computational and immune phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma, the most common chronic disease among children, is one of the five most burdensome diseases in the US. While current care and research efforts focus on symptom control and exacerbation risk, children with asthma may suffer from infectious and inflammatory diseases, ie, asthma-associated infectious and inflammatory disease comorbidities (AIICs) (eg, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, appendicitis, and celiac disease). Although AIICs pose serious threats to children with asthma, they are largely under-recognized, as evidenced by diabetes mellitus being widely recognized but a less common chronic illness with a magnitude similar to that for asthma. Presently, the mechanisms underlying AIICs are unknown. We postulate immunosenescence might be related, as AIICs coincide with cardinal immunosenescence features. AIICs are not clinically defined and a suitable tool has not been developed to identify children with AIICs. Thus, no strategies mitigating AIICs risks and outcomes exist. Addressing these knowledge gaps depends upon two key questions: (1) “How can asthmatic children subgroups with increased AIICs risk be identified at a population level using electronic medical records?” and (2) “What immune parameters characterize such children?” Answering these is this proposal's primary goal. To this end, our current R01 study successfully developed, validated, and implemented natural language processing (NLP)- empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for two existing criteria for childhood asthma (Predetermined Asthma Criteria, PAC and Asthma Predictive Index, API). NLP-empowered algorithm application to the 1997-2007 Olmsted County Birth Cohort (OCBC) enabled us to profile a subgroup of children with asthma at increased AIICs risk, disproportionately represented by children who met both NLP-PAC and NLP-API. Our new pilot data suggest asthma potentially accelerates immunosenescence leading to AIICs in a subgroup of asthmatic children. In this renewal proposal, we target this subgroup who meet both NLP-PAC and NLP-API. We will develop and apply NLP-empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for AIICs to identify such children at a population level, then characterize their immune parameters measuring immunosenescence. In Aim 1, we will develop new NLP-empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for recognized and unrecognized AIICs (NLP-AIIC) for children enrolled in Mayo Clinic `s 1997-2016 OCBC, then assess portability of NLP-AIIC at Sanford Children's Hospital, Sioux Falls, SD . In Aim 2, we will identify and characterize children with AIICs through new NLP-AIIC and NLP algorithms for asthma status, by utilizing clinical and immune parameters to measure immunosenescence. In Aim 3, we will assess changes (eg, waning adaptive immunity) over time in immune parameters measuring immunosenescence for 300 children in our R01 study, re-enrolling them for further characterization. This proposed study is indispensable to understanding why some children with asthma develop AIICs, while others do not. This knowledge will allow us to identify, manage, mitigate, and improve outcomes for AIICs among children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although asthma is the most common chronic disease among children in the United States, its impact on the risk of serious infections and inflammatory diseases is under-recognized. Presently, it is unknown 1) how to use electronic medical records to identify asthmatic children at increased risks of asthma-associated infectious and inflammatory disease comorbidities (AIICs) and 2) which immune parameters characterize such children. Addressing these two questions is this proposal's primary goal since this knowledge will help us strategize early identification of asthmatic children susceptible to AIICs, eventually mitigate risk of AIICs in children with asthma, and improve patient outcomes.",Identification and characterization of children with asthma-associated comorbidities through computational and immune phenotyping,10106650,R01HL126667,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appendicitis', 'Asthma', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Birth', 'CD3 Antigens', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cell Cycle', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sioux Falls', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'United States', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'empowered', 'immunosenescence', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'meetings', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'portability', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'response', 'senescence', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,793451
