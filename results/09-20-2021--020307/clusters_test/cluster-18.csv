"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",10203751,K01AI141616,"['Affect', 'Anti-malarial drug resistance', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomass', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticides', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Onchocerciasis', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'World Health Organization', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'infectious disease model', 'low income country', 'malaria transmission', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,146767
"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10223435,R01HL153543,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Education', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'brief intervention', 'clinically significant', 'dietary', 'dietary adherence', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'patient engagement', 'pilot trial', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'skills training', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2021,607792
"Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes Project Summary Excess weight is associated with 13 types of cancer. These cancers disproportionately affect Black and Latinx individuals, as well as those with lower socioeconomic status, because overweight and obesity incidence is higher in these groups. Behavioral weight loss interventions are effective, but in-person interventions tend to have low reach. As mobile phone ownership is increasing in the United States, mHealth technology holds promise for reaching a larger population than in-person behavioral interventions. Furthermore, because they travel with individuals and can collect digital information in real-time, mHealth tools make it possible to intervene with individuals at the precise point when the interventions are needed with just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). As currently implemented, mHealth JITAIs are adaptive in the sense that interventionists can specify decision rules a priori that result in intervention messages that are triggered or tailored by certain events. These experimenter-specified decision rules are generally based upon results of prior studies, specifically micro-randomized trials that provide sequential tests of mHealth intervention messages in order to determine causal effects of messages conditional on user context. However, JITAIs that are developed in this manner cannot be truly individually tailored because the same decision rules are equally applied to everybody without regard to information about how individuals actually respond to intervention messages. Rapidly evolving machine learning methods, specifically reinforcement learning (RL), makes it possible to improve upon the current approach to JITAIs by learning each person's unique response patterns and integrating this information into subsequent, person-specific, adaptive decision rules. However, the few behavioral interventionists who have created mHealth JITAIs for weight loss using RL have noted high practical barriers to doing so because implementation of RL requires specialized expertise and can be labor intensive. The field needs a user-friendly tool to reduce these barriers in order for RL methodology to become widely adopted. Aim 1 is to develop Adapt, a tool that iteratively integrates real-time data, applies RL algorithms, and performs micro-randomized trials to optimize JITAI decision rules for weight loss. Adapt will pull in digital health data in real-time and conduct micro-randomized trials using behavioral patterns and outcomes to arrive at the most efficacious intervention message, delivered at the right time, for promoting weight loss in each participant. Aim 2 is to conduct a 12-week pilot feasibility study testing usability of Adapt in a weight loss intervention (NudgeRL). NudgeRL will build upon the team's existing JITAI, Nudge, which did not incorporate RL. The sample will consist of 20 adults with overweight or obesity, at least 50% of whom are Black or Latinx. Although Adapt will be developed to improve weight loss interventions, its widespread use will result in more efficient and efficacious JITAIs across a broad range of health outcomes, resulting in a lower burden of cancer and other disease due to a wide spectrum of improved health behaviors. Project Narrative The objective of this project is to develop a tool that will make it easier for behavioral interventionists to implement reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, into adaptive mobile (mHealth) interventions, specifically those intended to promote weight control. Widespread use of this tool will result in more efficient and effective adaptive mHealth interventions, ultimately leading to a lower burden of obesity-linked disease, including cancer.",Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes,10195835,R21CA260092,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positive Reinforcements', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'digital', 'digital health', 'effective intervention', 'efficacious intervention', 'fitbit', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'obesity risk', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web-based tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,410893
"Compensation Training and Lifestyle Modifications to promote healthy aging in persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease: a digital application supported intervention The prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease and other disorders (ADRDs) is now a public health crisis. In the absence of effective medical treatment, there is a critical need for behavioral interventions to prevent or delay symptom onset. Multidomain interventions simultaneously targeting multiple modifiable risks for ADRD have shown promise, but additional innovative approaches that could be highly accessible by capitalizing on user- friendly digital applications to support and strengthen behavior modification are needed. Training in the use of compensatory aids (e.g., calendars and note taking systems) can improve daily independence. These same compensatory tools can be employed to facilitate the adoption of lifestyle changes that support brain health (e.g., exercise, cognitive engagement, stress management) through management of goal-setting, behavioral monitoring, tracking and feedback. The current project will test a 6-month intervention that provides training in both compensatory aids and lifestyle modification. A comprehensive suite of digital tools encapsulated in the Digital Memory Notebook (DMN), an easy to use, interactive application, will be used to facilitate behavioral change and enhance participant motivation. Further, the DMN allows collection of real-time data to track intervention adherence. The DMN has been successfully applied to improving compensation among individuals with mild cognitive impairment. The proposed work capitalizes on a critical window for building resilience by targeting individuals at risk for ADRD due to a subjective cognitive concern (SCC) but who remain cognitively normal. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among ethnoracially diverse older adults with SCC to compare our digital app supported compensation training and lifestyle modification intervention to an education only control group that will not use the DMN or be provided with guidance on how to implement the educational material into their daily lives. Specific aims of the project include: 1) evaluate intervention efficacy on primary outcomes (global cognition and everyday function); secondary outcomes focus on well-being, cognitive domains (memory and executive function), activities of daily living (IADLs), physical function, compensation, and health behaviors; 2) evaluate characteristics of treatment responders; 3) evaluate adherence and identify the effective components of the target intervention using a mixed-method approach; and 4) design machine learning algorithms that use patterns of change in real-time DMN data metrics to identify incipient declines in treatment adherence and changes in health status. The intervention under study is novel because it applies training in compensation to support lifestyle modifications and everyday functioning using a digital app that also monitors adherence to each component of the intervention in real-time. The project is expected to expand understanding of factors that may impact adherence to and outcomes of a preventative intervention leading to optimization of a scalable intervention to reduce dementia risk applicable to diverse populations. There is an urgent need to develop interventions that will delay functional disability and improve the quality of life of our growing aging population. This work is expected to lead to a scalable compensation and lifestyle intervention to improve well-being and delay disability in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease and other disorders. This research is relevant to public health and NIH's mission as the results are expected to have an important positive impact on caregiver burden, health care costs and the functional independence of our aging population.",Compensation Training and Lifestyle Modifications to promote healthy aging in persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease: a digital application supported intervention,10119873,R01AG066748,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calendar', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Encapsulated', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Financial compensation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Life Style Modification', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Self Determination', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain health', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'functional independence', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'healthy aging', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'resilience', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'stress management', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment responders', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,692048
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,10204099,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,378686
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,10129873,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app', 'web-based intervention']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,924106
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10187539,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detection platform', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2021,399000
"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,10200136,UH3HL144163,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adherence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Libraries', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Self Management', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'chatbot', 'copayment', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'four-arm study', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation process', 'improved', 'individual response', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety net', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'text messaging intervention', 'theories', 'treatment as usual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,UH3,2021,1417404
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10303076,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'efficacy evaluation', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,774997

"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and  technological advances to optimize intervention effects. Results of this study will further the overall strategic  aims of the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD), which are to inform and develop effective interventions  for FASD. This project will also benefit from resources and collaborations within CIFASD to carry out the  proposed work, including recruitment of a diverse sample, diagnostic support, and outreach and dissemination.  This is one of the first studies to empirically test an mHealth intervention delivered by parents with peer-­ moderated support. It has the potential to reach many families raising children with FASD in need and could  reduce significant barriers to care, resulting in a greater public health impact.

"Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement ABSTRACT Post-treatment substance use disorder (SUD) relapse rates are high (40-60% at one year), with relapse occurring early (median time to relapse 1-3 months), indicating that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Telehealth and VR technologies have the ability to greatly increase the accessibility of highly engaging recovery support. Combining these two approaches provides a unique opportunity to create a highly engaging, cost-effective take home recovery support solution targeting the critical transition from inpatient care. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its existing highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app, to develop a convenient and cost-effective integrated take-home combined VR and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) that begins in the inpatient clinic. RecoVRi is designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from inpatient to home, thereby reducing the risk of relapse and associated health and monetary costs. Sober Grid is collaborating with TRIPP, Inc. to utilize TRIPP’s immersive wellness platform. The design of the TRIPP experience leverages a large body of existing research on the use of VR technology in the mental wellness arena and utilizes proven mindfulness structures, targeted sound frequencies, visuals and interactions that have a multiplicative effect when administered through immersion. The Sober Grid Network will create a support wrapper to the VR experience that facilitates access to crisis management experts and community for the person in early recovery. The unique combination of a personalized and targeted self-regulation toolkit and community and professional support is a key differentiator for this service. In phase I of the project, we will develop and pilot test a proof-of-concept RecoVRi VR-mindfulness protocol and intervention to ascertain feasibility and acceptability (Aim 1). In phase II of the project, a production-quality intervention will be developed with new VR content created by the TRIPP development team specifically targeting themes supporting recovery from alcohol, stimulant and opioid SUD separately (Aim 2). We will then test post-treatment recovery support engagement in the RecoVRi intervention in comparison to treatment as usual in a randomized comparison trial involving 80 patients receiving inpatient treatment and transitioning to the home setting (Aim 3). Over the span of both phases, we will seek regulatory guidance from the FDA in order to attain clearance for use of the RecoVRi intervention as a therapeutic medical device (Aim 4). NARRATIVE Substance use treatment research findings indicate that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app to develop and test a convenient and cost-effective, integrated, take-home combined, virtual reality and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from the inpatient clinic to home.",Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement,10209530,R44DA050222,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Android', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Well in self', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'social', 'sound frequency', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment program', 'treatment research', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2021,840913
"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Project Narrative Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will develop a new version of existing software so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",10271571,U24EB028990,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Budgets', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health behavior', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SMART health', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoking', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief intervention', 'burden of illness', 'comparison intervention', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'good diet', 'handheld mobile device', 'healthy weight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'open data', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reduced substance use', 'repository', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'software development', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,377490
"Summer Research Experience Programs (R25) PROJECT SUMMARY This is a competitive renewal application for continued support of the Rutgers Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program. The SURF program provides undergraduates with 10-week basic science and translational hands-on research experiences in environmental health sciences, along with weekly networking and career activities. In this renewal application, funds are requested to support fellowships for 12 students. Students are admitted to the SURF program after review of scholastic achievement, letters of recommendation, and personal statements. Recruitment strategies are in place to continue to attract students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds. Under the mentorship of NIH-funded Rutgers faculty, SURF students conduct hands-on research projects focused on environmental health sciences, and participate in an innovative team-based field study that involves sampling and analysis of an environmental site with potential contamination. Students meet with mentors weekly to receive one-on-one training, ensure continued development of research skills, and evaluate progress of scientific projects. The SURF program draws upon the resources, infrastructure, and expertise of faculty who are members of the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, and part of our NIEHS T32 Toxicology predoctoral and postdoctoral training grant and NIEHS P30 Center for Environmental Exposures and Disease at Rutgers University Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and School of Public Health. Students also participate in weekly seminars and workshops on topics of career development, responsible conduct of research training, laboratory safety training, and environmental research. They also tour core facilities established as part of our NIEHS Center and are instructed in state-of-the-art technology for biomedical research. The summer program culminates in the preparation of oral presentations and abstracts (written and graphical) that describe key research findings. The SURF Program Directors have an extensive evaluation plan to ensure the continued development of the fellowship program and dissemination of innovative training approaches and successful metrics. During the prior funding period, R25-funded trainees have had outstanding outcomes including numerous national awards, co-authorship on peer-reviewed publications, and matriculation into professional and graduate programs in toxicology. Renewal of this R25 application will provide an opportunity for Rutgers faculty to continue to train the next generation of toxicologists and environmental health scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rutgers SURF is a structured hands-on research and career development summer program designed to enhance scientific literacy and prepare undergraduate students for graduate and professional education and careers in toxicology and environmental health sciences.

"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals Project Summary/Abstract This Administrative Supplement proposes the participation of a 3-member team from the Center for Progressive Recovery, LLC (CPR) in the Innovation Corps (I-Corps™), an intensive, 8-week program focused on developing a successful commercialization plan and business model for technology-driven start-ups funded by NIH’s SBIR Phase I mechanism. The program would entail training, as well as structure and accountability around conducting 100 interviews with key stakeholders and others whose expertise would inform the company’s plans. The SBIR Phase I award to CPR (the small business concern, SBC) that this application is predicated on addresses the problem that the people at the greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice- involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for this population are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. We will disrupt system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot. This will be the only tool needed to receive a referral to a bup provider. We will also address low individual motivation with the chatbot by programming it to deliver the efficacious Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) without the need for a trained human. Our aims are: Aim 1: Design and develop a prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (HCD) interviews with key stakeholders; and (b) creation of a chatbot using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) that is integrated with a mobile application; Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to the BNI Chatbot or Digital Resources (i.e., Digitally-delivered OUD and buprenorphine education and referral resources). The following 3-member team has deep expertise in developing and bringing to market digital health solutions and was formed to pursue the unique benefits of the I-Corps program. All 3 are able to meet the time-intensive requirements of the training program: 1) Michael V. Pantalon, Ph.D., CEO; 2) Marianne S. Pantalon, Ph.D., PI, and 3) Thomas Wheeler, Industry Expert and CTO. With this sophisticated program, CPR would be in a much better position to secure SBIR Phase II funding.

"Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention. Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence. Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments, have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec- tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup- port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul- sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro- cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con- tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur- suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda- tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study. The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect students at elevated risk of school violence, and provide risk characteristics to assist prevention. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing an ARIA system will help establish a nationwide solution for detecting and preventing school violence. The objectives of this proposal are consistent with NICHD's high-priority research areas that aim to develop new knowledge about the identification, etiology, early intervention, and mechanisms of violence from childhood through early adulthood.",Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention,10096109,R01HD103630,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Legal Guardians', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Process Assessment', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'school violence', 'school violence prevention', 'screening', 'study population', 'youth violence']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,457950
"Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment Abstract Seventy percent of American adults are overweight or obese, presenting an unprecedented challenge to the nation’s health systems. Effective behavioral programs exist, but these programs are intensive, long-term and require highly-trained clinicians, making them prohibitively expensive and thus limiting disseminability. Approaches to decreasing costs include replacing highly-trained clinicians with paraprofessionals, reducing contact frequency, and/or automating intervention. However, although these alternative interventions result in considerably lower average weight losses, variability of weight loss is high. Specifically, and consistent with a Supportive Accountability Model, a substantial minority of participants in high-intensity interventions receive no benefit, while a subset of those receiving low-intensity interventions achieve clinically significant weight loss. An ideal weight loss treatment system would enhance outcomes and reduce costs by matching each participant to the intervention he/she needs, thus adapting to participants’ needs and conserving resources where they are not needed. Stepped care represents one such system, but has had mixed success and suffers from a number of shortcomings. The innovative artificial intelligence (AI) strategy of reinforcement learning (RL) provides rapidly and repeatedly-varying features of intervention, continuously ""learning"" which features provide optimal responses for which participants. Our team recently completed a pilot of an AI weight loss system in which overweight adults received a brief in-person weight loss intervention and then were randomly assigned to receive 3 months of non-optimized interventions (i.e., 12-minute phone calls) or an optimized combination of phone calls, text exchanges, and automated messages, selected based on each participants’ response to each intervention as determined by weight and behavioral data. As hypothesized, we achieved equivalent weight losses at a fraction of the time cost. The proposed study would recruit 320 overweight adults, provide 1 month of group-based behavioral weight loss treatment and then randomize participants to either continue to receive group-based behavioral weight loss in a remote format for 11 months (BWL-S) or to reinforcement learning-based treatment (BWL-AI). In line with our Supportive Accountability model, BWL-AI would vary modality, intensity and counselor skill based on continuously-monitored participant digital data. The proposed study--the first of its kind--would expand on our pilot in several ways including sample size, duration, and features of intervention selected by the AI system. Aims of this project are to test the hypotheses that weight loss outcomes in BWL-AI will be equivalent to or better than BWL-S, and that the cost per participant and per kg of lost weight will be less in BWL-AI than in BWL-S. Other include characterizing the AI system (in terms of interventions selected), assessing feasibility and acceptability of the refined AI system, evaluating psychological and demographic predictors of AI intervention selection and investigating differences between responders and non-responders in how the AI system allocates resources. Project Narrative The obesity epidemic presents an unprecedented challenge to the nation’s health systems, and existing gold standard behavioral weight loss treatments are highly expensive to implement due to their intensive, long-term nature and the highly trained clinicians required to deliver treatment. Approaches to decreasing costs (e.g., low intensity treatments, coaching by paraprofessionals rather than experts) have been implemented with moderate success, but weight losses are not consistent across different cost-saving approaches, suggesting that individuals may be best served when they are matched to the type of treatment they need, and when the resources matched to individuals are continuously adapted as their needs change. The primary goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that continuously adjusts features of weight loss coaching including modality and coach skill level.",Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment,10210830,R01DK125641,"['Accelerometer', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Binge Eating', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cost Savings', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insurance', 'Intake', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Minority', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'care systems', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'cost effective treatment', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning progression', 'medication compliance', 'overweight adults', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'remote delivery', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment responders', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,634165
"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10259878,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical outcome measures', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'digital health', 'digital intervention', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,714718
"Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers ABSTRACT Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (PwADRD). Fall costs are expected to reach $67.7 billion this year and add to family caregiver (CG) burden. Injurious falls are a frequent reason people are unable to remain at home, resulting in significantly increased care costs to the family and society.  Most FP efforts fail to address understanding fall risks or changing behavior. In response to NIA requests for ‘Care technology to sustain in-home living, preserve function and promote effective communication’, an innovative falls prevention intervention for use by CGs of PwADRD living at home who are classified as at moderate to high fall risk for falls will be developed and tested. Goal: Develop FallScape for Dementia (FS-D), an innovative CG-provided daily treatment utilizing proprietary multimedia and behavioral intervention methods to facilitate communication and encourage FP behaviors that will reduce PwADRD falls.  The rigorous Phase 1 research plan will: a) develop a FS-D prototype that includes CG training software, multimedia and support tools to customize, conduct and review progress in daily CG-provided Mm sessions; b) Perform pilot testing and c) conduct a mixed methods preliminary clinical trial. Specific Aims and milestones/deliverables are: a) Develop prototype; i. Produce multimedia assets; ii. Craft Customization; iii. Artificial Intelligence algorithms; iv. Create CG training/daily administration tools. b) Pilot test prototype. i. Recruit 12 Dyads representing PwD diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy- body and Parkinson’s disease dementias. ii. Test CG ease of use and acceptability; iii. Examine customization for CG and dementia sub-types; iv. Evaluate relevance and dyad engagement. c) Conduct Preliminary Clinical Trial. 1. Recruit and enroll 25 Dyads; 2. Provide study components: initial; one-month FS-D intervention and a Follow-up; 3. Follow Dyads for 6 months; 4. Analyze outcomes and disseminate results.  FS-D will offer a rare opportunity to empower both CG and PwADRD by breaking the frustrating cycle of failure to recognize fall threats or change behavior and may mitigate CG burden. FS-D is an urgently needed falls prevention intervention for family CG use. The economic and quality of life benefits of sustaining in-home living for PwADRD by preventing falls will accrue to all stakeholders for this large, high-risk population. Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related Dementias (PwADRD) and the family caregiver (CG) is uniquely positioned to provide a positive daily interaction with the PwADRD in order to improve recognition of personal fall risks, encourage falls prevention behaviors and reduce falls. The proposed product FallScape- Dementia will develop and test a system for daily CG use in which Artificial Intelligence algorithms will guide the CG and customize the daily sessions. Reduction of falls will help the PwADRD to remain at home, reducing family and public health costs.",Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers,10260652,R43AG071360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Balance training', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Blood Vessels', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Failure', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family health status', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Long-Term Care', 'Los Angeles', 'Methods', 'Multimedia', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Administration', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'behavior change', 'care costs', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'fall injury', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'response', 'strength training', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIA,BROOKSIDE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT COMPANY,R43,2021,246663
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. Given elevated rates of violence among socio- disadvantaged adolescents with disparities in access to services, the proposed intervention, if efficacious, has the potential for significant public health impact, especially in low-resource urban communities.",Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement,10128481,R01HD097107,"['20 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Systems', 'Criminal Justice', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homicide', 'Hospitals', 'Imprisonment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Urban Community', 'Variant', 'Victimization', 'Videoconferencing', 'Violence', 'Violent injury', 'Work', 'Youth', 'arm', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'efficacious intervention', 'experience', 'gun violence', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning algorithm', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'recidivism', 'remote intervention', 'secondary outcome', 'societal costs', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'violence prevention', 'youth violence']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,628820
