"Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  Within the last decade, we have made great strides in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying multiple sclerosis (MS) risk and progression, however much of the variation remains unexplained. We have achieved significant reductions in the time to diagnosis and we have improved diagnostic sensitivity, however specificity is not ideal. Further, most of the FDA-approved MS-specific immunomodulatory therapies (IMTs) focus on the inflammatory disease component in the relapsing phase and have little effect on improving outcomes once a patient enters the progressive phase. The challenge for drug trials is the lack biomarkers to detect and monitor MS progression. The objectives of the current application are: 1. To identify and characterize biomarkers that discriminate MS and from other central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases (CNSIDDs) and non-CNSIDD controls, and 2. To identify biomarkers of disease activity and biomarkers that distinguish relapsing from progressive forms of MS. We propose a multi-stage analysis of pre-existing and well- defined biological samples from two resources.  Aim 1. Identify biochemical traits that discriminate MS from other CNSIDDs and healthy controls. Supervised machine learning and classification models will identify a metabolic signature discriminating MS from other CNSIDDs and healthy controls (HCs) in two cohorts. In the 1st cohort, MS patients who are early in their diagnosis (≤ 2 years) and IMT naïve/free will be compared to HCs and other CNSIDD cases. Discriminating metabolites will be tested for replication in a 2nd cohort comparing similarly defined MS patients to HCs and other CNSIDDs, and other autoimmune disease patients. We will determine the direction of the replicating MS- metabolite associations using bidirectional genetic instrumental variable analyses. Aim 2. Identify biochemical features of MS disease activity. We will identify metabolic variation corresponding to disease activity by comparing IMT naïve/free patients within 2 years of diagnosis and with a recent relapse to those who have been in remission for ≥3 months and to HCs using supervised classification in a discovery cohort followed by replication analyses in a 2nd cohort. Aim 3. Identify biochemical traits that discriminate progressive from relapsing MS. Supervised machine learning and classification models will identify metabolic patterns associated with MS progression by comparing IMT naïve/free patients with relapsing forms of MS to progressive MS from at a single academic specialty clinic. Aim 4. Identify metabolites that interact with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to increase MS risk. In this exploratory aim we will identify gene-metabolite (GxM) interactions involving the primary MS risk factor, HLA-DRB1*15:01. The encoded peptide is involved in antigen presentation and effectively binds to many endogenous metabolites, suggesting a mechanism through which autoreactive T cells may be activated. We will conduct GxM analyses in MS-HC matched pairs to identify metabolites associated with MS risk in the context of HLA-DRB1.  At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are to have identified and characterized a serum-derived metabolomic signature that discriminates MS from other CNSIDDs and non- CNSIDD controls. We also expect to have identified novel serum markers of MS disease activity and progression, as well as putative metabolites that interact with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to modify risk. These results will have an important positive impact by identifying serum-derived biochemical traits that could be used to improve diagnostic specificity in MS. There is also the promise of discerning novel molecular processes underlying MS, which will provide new opportunities for the development and evaluation of novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is possible that in the U.S. near 20% of the 900,00 persons with an established multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis may have been misdiagnosed, with 60-70% having been on FDA-approved MS immunomodulatory therapies. Misdiagnosis represents an unacceptable burden, thus there is a critical need for accurate discrimination of MS from non-MS conditions, and there is a need for biomarkers that can monitor disease activity and progression. We hypothesize that the serum metabolome is an attractive non-invasive target for identifying such biomarkers. In this proposal we seek to: 1. Identify and characterize biomarkers that discriminate MS and from non-MS conditions and unaffected controls, and 2. Identify biomarkers of relapse activity and biomarkers that distinguishes relapsing from progressive forms of MS.",Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis,10197636,R01NS121928,"['Antibodies', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complement', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Financial cost', 'Free Will', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Health', 'Inflammatory', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neuromyelitis Optica', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'autoreactive T cell', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'medical specialties', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein', 'side effect', 'supervised learning', 'targeted therapy trials', 'trait']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,518973

"MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library PROJECT SUMMARY Infectious diseases have a substantial global health impact. Clinicians need rapid and accurate diagnoses of infections to direct patient treatment and improve antibiotic stewardship, but current methodologies face severe limitations in this regard. In the first funding cycle of our MPI grant “GM111066 - MS diagnostic bacterial identification library,” we produced a novel diagnostic platform in which microbial membrane glycolipids analyzed by mass spectrometry represent chemical “fingerprints” that were then used to differentiate Gram- negative and –positive and fungal isolates after mono- or poly-microbial growth in standard laboratory medias or complex biological (urine, blood bottles, and would effluent). In the second funding cycle, we aim to improve the diagnostic as discussed below.  At the start this project, it had not been previously shown that bacterial or fungal membrane lipids could provide a unique chemical signature or barcode that could be used for reliable pathogen identification. The fact that these lipids (Gram-: LPS/lipid A, Gram+: Lipoteichoic acid/cardiolipin, Fungi: glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols) are present in high abundance (~106 copies per cell) makes them easily extractable with a single rapid LPS-based protocol (less than 60 minutes from sample to MS identification). Importantly, for clinical use, we successfully used our platform to solve these four major unmet needs from the protein-based phenotyping approach: 1) removed the need for growth prior to MS analysis, 2) identification of bacterial and fungal isolates with a single extraction protocol, 3) identification directly from complex biological fluids, including urine, BAL fluid, wound effluent, and blood bottles, and 4) antimicrobial resistant strains could be distinguished from the related susceptible strain. Finally, based on our thirteen peer-reviewed publications from the first funding period and extensive preliminary data, we believe we have proven our highly innovative original hypothesis and even advanced it past the original aims by using a design of experiment (DOE) process to allow identification in under an hour direct from specimen.  In the second funding cycle, we propose to further innovate by i) using DOE to improve limit of detection (LOD) from 106 to 103 which is the threshold for urinary tract infections; ii) extend the assay to direct analysis of urine and stool samples without culture; iii) develop machine learning approaches to improve identification of individual bacteria from polymicrobial infections; iv) expand detection of antimicrobial resistance beyond colistin; v) develop a method for identification and structure analysis of lipids isolated from 100-1000 cells; and vi) vastly expand our ability to identify pathogenic fungi, which are a growing healthcare issue, and Gram- positive organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Failure to identify bacterial and fungal infections rapidly places an enormous financial burden on the U.S. health system totaling billions annually with complications from minor events extending hospital stays to death from sepsis. We have developed a lipid-based MS method for bacterial and fungal identification that can be carried out in under an hour direct from specimen. Here, we will further develop this method for use in the study of complex biological fluids, including stool, urine, and blood bottles without culture. Specifically, we will improve the limit of detection in order to distinguish microbial load at or below 103 CFU/ml ! !",MS Diagnostic Bacterial Identification Library,10116273,R01AI147314,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cardiolipins', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Colistin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Feces', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Glycerophospholipids', 'Glycolipids', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length of Stay', 'Libraries', 'Lipid A', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycoses', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sphingolipids', 'Sterols', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'cost', 'design', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic platform', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'fungus', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lipoteichoic acid', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'point of care', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistant strain', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'ward', 'wound']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,463500
"Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that destroys the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, and its cause is unknown. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, leading to the hypothesis that sun exposure, and consequently vitamin D exposure, has a protective effect on MS risk. Recent studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis have demonstrated strong evidence for a causal role of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in MS pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association are unknown. It is well established that 25(OH)D signaling operates through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. VDRs recognize specific binding sites in DNA, leading to activation or suppression of a target gene. Previous research has found that genetic variation of tagging SNPs (VDR-BVs) within these VDR binding sites, can alter binding affinity. These VDR-BVs are enriched in genomic regions associated with MS, as well as with several other autoimmune diseases, which suggests regulation of specific genes mediated by vitamin D could affect MS risk and severity. No formal investigation of genetic variation of individual VDR-BVs in MS cases and controls has been reported and VDR-BVs are strong candidates to investigate for genetic variation relevant to MS. The overall objective of this F31 application is to estimate the effect of VDR-BVs on MS risk and severity. We hypothesize that genetic variation in VDR-BVs is associated with MS susceptibility and severity, and further, that the effect of this genetic variation on MS is modulated by bioavailability of vitamin D. Our approach will use a dataset of approximately 10,000 clinically definite MS cases and 35,000 controls frequency matched on age and race/ethnicity with whole genome genotypes, demographic, clinical, and environmental exposure data and will: 1) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs near established MS risk loci and MS risk and severity; 2) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs across the human genome and MS risk and severity; and 3) Replicate findings in independent datasets of MS cases and controls and combine replicated associations across all datasets via meta-analysis. VDR-BVs were previously identified through ChIP-seq analysis in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines and we will use machine learning to prioritize candidate VDR-BVs for Aim 2. Analyses will incorporate a genetic instrumental variable as measure of 25(OH)D bioavailability to test for interaction between VDR-BVs and 25(OH)D bioavailability. Results from the proposed aims will determine whether MS GWAS findings are partially explained by genetic variation in VDR binding affinity, identify genetic risk factors for MS related to vitamin D, and identify new genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of MS. Ultimately, the goal of this work understand the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects this immune- mediated neurological disorder. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that results in significant disability and decreased quality of life with both genetic and environmental risk factors. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, and recent research has demonstrated evidence supporting a causal role for low vitamin D in MS risk and disease severity. The objective of this F31 fellowship application is to identify and characterize vitamin D binding sites that are associated with susceptibility to MS and disease severity.",Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity,10145491,F31NS113537,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'California', 'ChIP-seq', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Study Subject', 'Sun Exposure', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vitamin D3 Receptor', 'Work', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'multiple datasets', 'nervous system disorder', 'pediatric multiple sclerosis', 'programs', 'protective effect', 'receptor binding', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,42076
"Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies ABSTRACT: Endometriosis is a chronic pathologic condition that affects approximately 176 million worldwide, and can cause severe abdominal pain and subfertility. Despite its prevalence, there is currently no widely accepted theory of pathogenesis for endometriosis. Further, there are currently no clinical biomarkers for non- invasive diagnosis as most patients are only diagnosed at the time of exploratory laparoscopy. Thus, application of new molecular technologies to advance the understanding, diagnosis, and intraoperative detection of endometriosis is critically needed to improve patient care and management. Ambient mass spectrometry (MS) techniques offer the chemical specificity and sensitivity to perform rapid and in-depth molecular analysis of unprocessed tissue samples. We propose to conduct a rigorous study applying MS techniques in conjunction with statistical methods to identify, characterize, and validate metabolic and protein markers of endometrial and endometriosis tissues correlated to patient symptoms and disease presentation. Further, we propose to evaluate the performance of ambient MS techniques as tools for rapid diagnosis of endometrial tissues, and in vivo intraoperative disease detection. Combining our team’s expertise in MS, statistics, gynecological surgery, pathology and endometriosis, we are unique poised to successfully carry out the following proposed aims: Aim 1. Characterize metabolic and proteomic markers of endometriosis tissues from endometriosis patients using MS imaging. Characterization of molecular markers that are specific to endometriosis lesions within tissue microenvironment can lead to new understanding of the biological mechanisms governing endometriosis development and pinpoint potential targets for treatment. Using a large cohort of tissues prospectively collected from surgeries, we will use MS imaging and statistical analysis to identify molecular signatures of endometriosis tissues and uncover significant molecular alterations correlated to patient phenotypes and disease presentation within controlled patient subgroups. Aim 2. Define diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissues from endometriosis and unaffected patients. New methods for accurate and rapid diagnosis endometriosis are critically needed to advance patient care. We propose to use MS imaging and statistical analyses to identify diagnostic markers of endometriosis using endometrial tissue samples obtained from eutopic endometrium of endometriosis patients, and endometrium tissues from unaffected patients undergoing other benign gynecological procedures, with the goal of identifying molecular markers that could use for diagnosis of endometriosis from tissue biopsies. Aim 3. Test the MasSpec Pen as an intraoperative tool for in vivo endometriosis detection. Complete excision of endometriosis lesions and preservation of healthy adjacent tissues is of utmost importance in the surgical treatment of patients. We propose to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the performance of MasSpec Pen technology for in vivo detection of endometriosis lesions and surgical guidance in laparoscopic procedures. Narrative  We propose to develop and use mass spectrometry technologies in conjunction with statistical methods to better understand, detect, and diagnose endometriosis. By leveraging the advantages of the chemical sensitivity and specificity of mass spectrometry with the simplicity, speed, and spatial correlation offered by ambient mass spectrometry techniques, we aim to develop new methods that can improve the diagnosis and management of endometriosis at multiple stages of patient treatment using a large cohort of patient samples. The experiments proposed will explore the molecular differences between eutopic and ectopic endometrium tissues, correlate molecular data with patient phenotypes and disease presentation, advance development of a diagnostic method for endometriosis, and improve the surgical resection of endometriosis lesions in vivo during surgical procedures, leading to new understanding of this disease and offering improved treatment options for patients.",Molecular Imaging and Diagnosis of Endometriosis using Mass Spectrometry Technologies,10219741,R01HD101560,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Endometrial', 'Endometrium', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic Surgical Procedures', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Laparoscopy', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'endometriosis', 'eutopic endometrium', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in situ imaging', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'ionization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'new technology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient subsets', 'predictive signature', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'rapid diagnosis', 'rapid technique', 'reproductive', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'subfertility', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,205035
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment, physical disability and progressive disease are common but understudied clinical outcomes that substantially impact employment and overall quality of life for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). We have recently developed and validated an assisted, web-based tool (ICLIC-MS) for systematic and longitudinal clinical outcomes data collection of MS-validated cognitive function measures, physical disability and progressive disease measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR). In response to FOA# PA-17-010, Use of Technology to Enhance Patient Outcomes and Prevent Illness, our team proposes the study of MS outcomes in a large, multi-ethnic population representative sample of more than 3,000 female and male MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan Membership. We will integrate other EHR data such as important comorbid conditions, use of disease modifying therapy, MRI reports, as well as quality of life measures and employment histories. Our goals include: 1) comprehensively characterizing clinical outcomes in a large MS patient cohort; 2) developing and utilizing an integrated MS health report to enhance patient care; and 3) establishing a resource for clinical outcomes research in MS that also includes whole genomic and environmental exposure data. Findings from our proposed study represent an extraordinary opportunity to facilitate effective long-term management of MS, accelerate progress in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, predict patient trajectories and inform prevention strategies. We have assembled a team with strong expertise in clinical neurology/MS neurology, advanced epidemiologic methods, EHR structure and clinical care within a health maintenance organization, human genomics, biostatistics, and big data approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our team has developed and validated an assisted web-based interface for longitudinal clinical data collection of cognitive function measures, physical disability and depression measures that are not reliably captured in the electronic health record (EHR) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We will integrate several sources of patient data including genomic, clinical and EHR for 3,000 individuals to facilitate research and improve clinical care.",ICLIC-MS for Enhancing Outcomes Research and Clinical Care in Multiple Sclerosis,10160965,R01NR017431,"['Address', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employment', 'Employment Status', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preparation', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Progressive Disease', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical outcome measures', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'disability', 'electronic data', 'health plan', 'human genomics', 'improved', 'male', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'new technology', 'physically handicapped', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'web based interface', 'web-based tool']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,587963

We have discovered that higher saturated fat and lower vegetable dietary intake may independently increase the risk of relapse in those with the disease. Our preliminary findings, consistent with the association of high fat diet with higher risk of MS relapse, suggest that higher plasma levels of three acyl-ethanolamides (endocannabinoids) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may be associated with higher relapse risk in children. Lipids mediators such as oxylipins and endocannabinoids have immunomodulatory properties and some are neuroprotective. Their plasma levels are influenced among others by dietary intake, obesity status and genetic profile. Furthermore, our findings that the tryptophan pathway is associated with the risk of relapse and disease progression links plausibly to expected changes in short chain fatty acids that we plan to investigate. Although MS is less common in children, studies in this age group have several important advantages including less irrelevant exposures and comorbidities that result from aging. With previous NIH and National MS Society support, we have established a highly collaborative national research group and a unique resource that will be leveraged in this proposal to test new hypotheses. We propose state-of-the-art untargeted and targeted metabolomics and lipidomics analyses to determine the association of various plasma and stool lipids and their mediators with the risk of subsequent relapse, new MRI lesions, and neurologic and cognitive impairment. Each individual has extensive demographic, clinical, MRI, genetic, food frequency and environmental exposure data. Analyses will be adjusted for possible confounders such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic profile, use of disease-modifying therapy, body mass index and serum 25(OH) vitamin D. We will also model the contribution of various metabolites in the context of adipokines, food frequency, gut microbiome profile and genetic variants that modulate plasma lipid and mediator levels. This sophisticated modelling including pathway analyses will establish which of the variables are independent predictors. Our group of collaborators with expertise in metabolomics, lipidomics, genetics, and environmental risk factors is in a unique position to significantly advance the understanding of MS pathogenesis. The findings in the proposed study will unravel biological links between diet, gut microbiome, obesity and MS course. Although longitudinal association studies do not confirm causality, they are critical to identify putative biological pathways that may contribute to disease activity and progression. Intervention studies cannot be designed if associations are unknown. Our proposed investigation has strong potential for clinical translation as we will identify biological targets that can then be tested for causality in proof-of-concept MS trials with interventions such as supplementation with live biotherapeutic products influencing metabolic pathways of interest. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our pediatric MS Network has recently discovered that diet may influence MS course: higher fat and lower vegetable intake correlate with higher risk of relapse. Our preliminary findings suggest that three degradation products from fats measured in the blood and known to increase inflammation increase the risk of MS relapses. In the proposed study, we will identify which blood and stool fats, alone or in combination, correlate with MS relapse and disability progression.",Metabolic correlates of disease activity and disability progression in pediatric MS,10210165,R01NS117541,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Blood', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Dietary intake', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fermentation', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'High Fat Diet', 'Immune response', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipoxygenase', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Obesity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Propionates', 'Race', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Societies', 'Supplementation', 'Testing', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan Metabolism Pathway', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vegetables', 'Vitamin D', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'adipokines', 'age group', 'biobank', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive disability', 'comorbidity', 'data reduction', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'forest', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'lipid mediator', 'lipidomics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'pediatric multiple sclerosis', 'pediatric patients', 'physically handicapped', 'relapse risk', 'saturated fat', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'stool sample', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,422773
"Multimodal Machine-Learning and High Performance Computing Strategies for Big MS Proteomics Data Project Abstract/Summary Mass spectrometry (MS) data is high-dimensional data that is used for large-scale system biology proteomics. The current state of the art mass spectrometers can generate thousands of spectra from a single organism and experiment. This high-dimensional data is processed using database searches and denovo algorithms with varying degrees of success. The overarching objective of this study is to develop, test, integrate and evaluate novel image-processing and deep-learning algorithms that will allow us to deduce and identify reliable peptide sequences in a definitive and quantitative fashion. Our long-term goal is to improve on identification of MS based proteomics data using novel and scalable algorithms. The objective of this proposal is to investigate, design and implement machine-learning deep-learning algorithms for identification of peptides from MS data. Since deep-learning is very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data it will be ideal solution for discovering dark proteomics data and more accurate deduction of peptides. We predict that the integration of these methods, along with traditional numerical algorithms, will lead to a multimodal fusion-based approach for an optimized and accurate peptide deduction system for large-scale MS data. Further, we will design and implement data augmentation, memory-efficient indexing, and high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve these outcomes more efficiently with a shorter computational time. Therefore, this new line of investigation is significant since it has the potential to improve on long-stalled effort to increase accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of MS data analysis and search tools. The proximate expected outcome of this work is a novel set of deep-learning and image-processing tools which will allow much better insight in MS based proteomics data.

"Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most widespread non-traumatic, demyelinating disorder in young adults. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aids in both diagnosing MS and assisting clinical management of patients. In addition to focal MS lesions, diffusely abnormal white matter (DAWM) is also seen on brain MRI in MS patients. While not understood completely, DAWM is thought to be a predictor of disease burden, possibly appears early on in the disease, and may be a marker of neurodegeneration in MS. However, longitudinal studies of DAWM are lacking, and segmentation of DAWM is manual, making it difficult to study the evolution of DAWM. The main objective of this proposal is to longitudinally study the development of DAWM in MS. This objective will be realized by analyzing preexisting longitudinal MRI data acquired on 1008 MS patients who participated in phase 3, blinded, multi-center clinical trial, referred to as CombiRx that was supported by NIH. The CombiRx data includes multi-contrast MRI and various clinical measures. Automatic identification of DAWM is a critical component of this proposal. Based on our preliminary studies, deep Learning (a class of machine learning algorithms) has the potential to automatically identify DAWM and estimate its volume. We will use the large CombiRx MRI data for training, validation, and testing of the deep learning models, and to study DAWM evolution in this MS cohort. The proposal has two major aims. In the first aim we will develop a deep learning model based on fully-convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of DAWM, gray matter, normal appearing white matter, and T2-hyperintense lesions guided by manual segmentation of two neuroimaging experts. In the second aim we will segment DAWM and all brain tissues, including focal lesions, at baseline and all available follow-up scans in the CombiRx cohort (up to 6.5 years). The temporal changes in volume, location, and MRI parameters of DAWM and focal T2 lesions will be computed. We will finally test whether DAWM is precursor to focal T2 lesions, associated with T2 lesion resolution, or a separate disease process altogether. If DAWM is shown to occur early on in the disease, it is possible to intervene sooner for improved outcome. Similarly, if DAWM is shown to be related to disease activity, it can serve as an objective and quantitative measure of the disease. Such an objective measurement would be highly valuable in developing targeted therapies and also in evaluating the treatment effect in MS patients. The main objective of this proposal is to study the evolution of diffusely appearing white matter (DAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) using a novel deep learning approach. The results of this study are expected to be highly valuable in evaluating the treatment effect in individual MS patients. These results can also help reduce time and money in conducting clinical trials substantially, which would lead to early introduction of promising drugs into the market. Finally, if DAWM occurs early on in the disease, as suggested by some of the publications, it is possible to therapeutically intervene sooner for improved outcome.",Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach,10217627,R21NS118320,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Demyelinations', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protons', 'Publications', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated segmentation', 'axonopathy', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment effect', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,234000
"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10251254,R01HD102537,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Compound Q', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Work', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening panel', 'screening program', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'web-based tool']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,505339
"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"OCT and OCTA image processing for retinal assessment of people with MS Project Summary/Abstract (Max 30 lines of text) Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS), it has been challenging to acquire consistent MRI measurements of MS disease burden. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retina has emerged as a complementary source of imaging biomarkers, wherein retinal thickness measurements have been shown to correlate well with MS disease burden. As well, OCT angiography (OCTA)—a new imaging modality acquired with the same OCT scanner—yields multiple new biomarkers among which macular vessel density has been shown to correlate with MS disability. There is strong evidence that OCT and OCTA may provide much needed imaging biomarkers for MS, but there are remaining technical challenges to overcome. Many algorithms for computation of retinal layer thicknesses from OCT images have been developed, but measurement of longitudinal changes in individual MS subjects remains highly challenging, especially in MS where yearly changes are small relative to intrinsic measurement variations. We propose a novel iterative registration and deep learning segmentation algorithm for longitudinal OCT retinal image segmentation. Development of automatic algorithms for analysis of OCTA images is in an early stage and there are opportunities for significant improvements. We will develop a deep network for OCTA vessel segmentation and biomarker computation that both suppresses artifacts that are common in OCTA and provides consistent results across different scanners. As both OCT and OCTA become more widely used in the characterization and management of MS, it is becoming increasingly important to jointly characterize these biomarkers and relate them to disease status, which is currently characterized largely by clinical evaluations. We will address the central question of whether OCT and OCTA can be used to predict disease progression by developing a new disease progression score for MS based on multiple OCT and OCTA measurements as well as clinical and MRI biomarkers, acquired in both single and multiple imaging visits. The proposed research will: 1) Develop a fast, topologically-correct longitudinal segmentation method for the macula; 2) Develop a method for artifact-suppressed and consistent computation of OCTA features in the macula; 3) Develop a disease progression score to jointly characterize longitudinal retinal OCT and OCTA measurements in MS; and 4) Carry out longitudinal studies of healthy controls and people with MS using OCT and OCTA measurements. We will assess whether average features within the macula or features averaged over smaller segments yield better estimates of progression. We will also assess whether OCT alone or OCT together with OCTA provide better estimates of progression. Image processing and disease progression algorithms will be made freely available to the research community. The proposed research will greatly advance the use of OCT and OCTA in characterizing longitudinal changes in the retina, potentially leading to standard eye measurements for monitoring and managing MS and other neurological and eye diseases. Project Narrative Monitoring the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been challenging due to the inconsistency and variability of both clinical and magnetic resonance imaging assessments. This project will develop methods and software for analysis of both optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) scans of the retina, both of which show correlation to disability in MS. At the conclusion of the grant, software implementing the methods will be made available to the research community in a highly portable computer language.",OCT and OCTA image processing for retinal assessment of people with MS,10127738,R01EY032284,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Four-dimensional', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Play', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord Lesions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'advanced disease', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'ganglion cell', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning progression', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'portability', 'random forest', 'recursive neural network', 'research clinical testing', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retinal imaging', 'segmentation algorithm', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'white matter']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,441023
"Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract:  The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging due to its clinical heterogeneity and lengthy differential diagnosis. The incorrect assignment of a diagnosis of MS occurs in approximately 9% of newly evaluated patients and is associated with considerable clinically important, and avoidable, medical risk, morbidity, and healthcare costs. At the same time studies have demonstrated that many patients encounter a significant diagnostic delay prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of MS. In such patients early and accurate diagnosis of MS can result in prompt initiation of disease modifying therapy and consequent preventable disability. MS remains a clinical diagnosis and diagnostic criteria for MS are revised periodically, including most recently in 2017. Since implementation of the 2017 criteria, like all prior revisions, will continue to rely on subjective clinical and radiological assessments for its fulfillment, misdiagnosis will remain a risk.  New objective, automated, and clinically applicable approaches to MS diagnosis are needed. Recent preliminary data from cross-sectional pilot studies in patients with established diagnoses have shown promise for three new radiographic and three new laboratory methods to differentiate MS from other disorders. The present study will evaluate these six methods for the first time in a prospective cohort of 125 patients undergoing an initial evaluation for MS at an academic MS subspecialty center. The specificity and sensitivity of each method will be compared to fulfillment of 2017 MS diagnostic criteria at the time of initial clinical evaluation. Using diagnostic thresholds developed from this analysis, a two year post-enrollment analysis will also be performed in participants who did not meet 2017 criteria initially but did so during the subsequent two year interval to determine if the study methods could have predicted a diagnosis of MS earlier in such patients. The use of a multimodal and machine-learning approach to evaluate the integration of each of these six new methods which represent different aspects of MS neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes will also be performed during each analysis, and such a combination of radiographic and laboratory methodology may provide superior diagnostic accuracy compared to any given method alone.  Planned collaborative career development, mentoring, and advising activities will facilitate acquisition of specific advanced quantitative and qualitative research skills necessary to develop and coordinate collection of data for this large prospective cohort study to rigorously evaluate new diagnostic methods for MS and incorporate machine learning analyses. Successful completion of this study will provide experience and skills necessary to move the field of MS diagnosis forward through a planned prospective multicenter NIH R01 funded study. Project Narrative: A highly specific, sensitive, objective and automated novel diagnostic approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) is needed maximize early benefits of disease modifying therapy in patients with MS and to prevent the frequent problem of MS misdiagnosis. This project assesses three novel MRI techniques and three novel blood tests for the diagnosis of MS in a large prospective cohort undergoing a new clinical evaluation for suspect MS. While each method may show promise alone, utilization of machine learning methodology combining these approaches that represent different aspects of MS pathophysiology may demonstrate a highly accurate and clinically applicable methodology for MS diagnosis.",Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers,10070136,K02NS109340,"['Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atrophic', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'C-Peptide', 'Central Vein', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Qualitative Research', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Whole Blood', 'accurate diagnosis', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neurofilament', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel imaging technique', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'specific biomarkers', 'support vector machine', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K02,2021,192792
"Virtual Histology for Assessing MS Pathologies PROJECT SUMMARY Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease with, ultimately, irreversible axonal injury leading to permanent neurological disabilities. Preventing disease progression or treating progressive MS remains a major unmet clinical need. We have previously developed a novel data-driven model-selection diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) to accurately image inflammation, demyelination, and axonal injury, as well as quantifying axonal loss in the presence of vasogenic edema in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and spinal cord injury mice, and brain WM pathologies in MS. MRI does not distinguish inter- from intra-axonal water signals, reflecting a weighted-average of signals between the two compartments. However, our recent observation that DBSI derived axial diffusivity (DBSI-λǁ) was slightly elevated in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in people with MS (pwMS). This elevated DBSI-λǁ added uncertainty in assessing whether axonal injury (against the notion that ↓DBSI-λǁ ≈ axonal injury) is present in NAWM of these pwMS. In this proposed study, we will refine DBSI to further improve its sensitivity and specificity to axonal injury/loss, demyelination, and inflammation for accurately assessing disease progression and therapeutic efficacy in pwMS. Since MRI does not distinguish inter- from intra-axonal water signals, it reflects a weighted-average between inter- and intra-axonal signals. In the presence of inflammation-associated edema or minor axonal loss in pwMS, the longer diffusion time for human scanners coupled with the increased inter-axonal space will lead to increased DBSI-λǁ masking the detectability of axonal injury. Thus, through separating inter- and intra-axonal water compartment signals, the sensitivity and specificity to axonal injury of DBSI-derived intra-axonal λ|| (DBSI-IA-λ||) may be improved. This new model will still preserve the isotropic diffusion specificity to inflammation and tissue loss. We propose three specific aims to prove or disprove this hypothesis: Aim 1. To perform DBSI and DBSI-IA analyses on autopsy specimens from pwMS followed by conventional histology and immunohistochemical staining. Aim 2. To perform DBSI and DBSI-IA modeling on perfused frog sciatic nerve with and without contrast agent to separate inter-/intra-axonal space water signal. Aim 3a. To develop a Diffusion Histology Imaging (DHI) approach combining DBSI/DBSI-IA metrics and machine/deep learning algorithms to recapitulate histology specificity to MS pathology. Aim 3b. To translate DBSI-IA model to analyze existing DWI data from the cohort of pwMS previously imaged in an expired program project. PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is common, affecting over 700,000 people in the US. It is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with pronounced axon damage inflicting long-term neurological disability. Accurate assessment of axonal injury early especially in normal appearing white matter is crucially important in therapeutic intervention. For example, we cannot expect remyelination to work on absent or critically injured axons. Thus, the proposed diffusion basis spectrum imaging to model intra-axonal diffusion for improving the sensitivity of detecting axonal injury is of great importance in treating and curing MS.",Virtual Histology for Assessing MS Pathologies,10121338,R01NS116091,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fast Blue', 'Fiber', 'Gadolinium DTPA', 'Gadopentetate Dimeglumine', 'Germany', 'Glucose', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Myelin', 'Nerve', 'Neurologic', 'Optic Nerve', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Periodic acid Schiff stain method', 'Rana', 'Reporting', 'Ringer&apos', 's solution', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tolonium chloride', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'central nervous system demyelinating disorder', 'central nervous system injury', 'cohort', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'disability', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'manganese chloride', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'remyelination', 'sciatic nerve', 'severe injury', 'spectrograph', 'support vector machine', 'vasogenic edema', 'virtual', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,473791
"Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI Project Summary/Abstract Background: Although current MRI performs well as a tool to measure white matter (WM) inflammation in MS, its ability to quantify gray matter (GM) pathology, meningeal inflammation, and chronic inflammatory changes are limited. For this reason, researchers have looked to 7-tesla (7T) MRI for more robust in vivo measures of pathology. Although the increased sensitivity of 7T MRI for these aspects of MS have stimulated much interest, the impact of previous studies have been limited due to small sample sizes, varying methodologies, cumbersome analysis methods, and conflicting results – all of which have limited the generalizability of findings and more widespread dissemination of the use of this tool. Objective: In this study, we aim to advance the use of 7T MRI as a tool for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment effect monitoring by performing multi-site, large sample size evaluation of imaging correlates of cortical and deep GM lesions, chronic active WM lesions (WM lesions with paramagnetic rims on MRI), and meningeal inflammation (leptomeningeal inflammation (LME) on MRI) and validation of their clinical relevance. We also will look develop automated tools for identification and quantification of these findings on 7T MRI. Study Design: Imaging and clinical data will be derived from previous and ongoing studies of the use of 7T MRI in MS performed at multiple collaborative sites under the umbrella of the North American Imaging in MS (NAIMS) Collaborative, including the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Harvard-Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University. This includes data on up to 814 individual persons with MS, 1232 individual study visits, and a follow up period of up to 5 years. GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME will be identified on 7T, with critical evaluation of methods and their relationship to clinical data. Further, the manual analysis results will be used as training sets for deep learning algorithms for identification of these abnormalities on future 7T MRI scans. Impact: This study would provide the data on measurement variability and generalizable clinical importance of the imaging findings being investigated, along with providing automated tools for future, high-throughput studies. In advancing these precise measures of aspects of MS pathology only poorly measured on lower field MRI, this study will lead to more accurate MS diagnoses, improvements in the ability to monitor changes in MS pathology over time, and perhaps lead to the screening of new pharmaceutical interventions to target GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME. Project Narrative In this study, multiple institutions performing research using 7-tesla (7T) MRI research on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will combine data for a large scale, pooled analysis project. The investigators will refine methods for visualizing cortical and deep gray matter lesions, chronically inflamed white matter lesions, and meningeal inflammation on 7T MRI in MS and will evaluate their clinical relevance on a large scale and develop machine learning algorithms for future identification. It is expected that validating findings on 7T and their clinical relevance along with providing automated tools for analysis will lead to the use of 7T MRI as a more widespread clinical tool, resulting in earlier diagnoses, better prognostication, and more effective treatment monitoring in MS.",Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI,10278178,R01NS122980,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Baltimore', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maryland', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meningeal', 'Meninges', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Predisposition', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive disability', 'comparative', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'outcome forecast', 'physically handicapped', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,535821
