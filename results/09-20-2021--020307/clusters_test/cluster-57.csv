"Transforming Patient Safety Event Data into Actionable Insights through Advanced Analytics Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to develop an innovative algorithms and a software tool to reduce the burden of safety event report classification and analysis so that report data can be transformed to actionable insights. Making safety event data more actionable will support the proactive identification of safety hazards before patients are harmed. We will achieve our research objective through (1) the development of natural language processing algorithms to classify safety event reports into actionable medication error categories; (2) the development of prototype software that will automatically categorize and visualize safety event reports to support trend identification; and (3) the pilot testing of prototype software with hospital and patient safety organization safety analysts. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, including computer science, specifically regarding information retrieval and data classification. Our research team includes patient safety organizations and collaboration with the computer science department at Georgetown University. The proposal is directly aligned with AHRQ’s priority area of making health care safer. Contributions from this research will include an expansion of our understanding of natural language processing and its application to categorizing clinical text, advances in visual analytics, and the development of a software tool to support patient safety analysts. The outputs of this research will serve both healthcare organizations and patient safety organizations allowing them to more efficiently and effectively analyze safety report data. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies human factors and computer science to develop software to improve the analysis of patient safety event report data to reduce safety hazards and prevent patient harm. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed using natural language processing algorithms to more efficiently classify events into error categories. Based on these algorithms, prototype software will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of automatic categorization and visualization of safety event reports to identify important safety hazards.",Transforming Patient Safety Event Data into Actionable Insights through Advanced Analytics,10249058,R01HS026481,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,395495
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10162467,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis', 'venous thromboembolism']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,561787
"Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy Project Summary The WHO approved 3 months weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) has been found non-inferior to 6H in preventing TB reactivation and achieves higher completion rates. The National TB program in Uganda is currently transitioning from 6HP to 3HP which will be scaled up starting in Jan 2021. Rifapentine has not been widely used in Uganda outside clinical trials and therefore its safety profile in programmatic setting in adults and children is still uncertain. Accurate profiling of patients likely to experience 3HP related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has the potential to improve TPT completion rates, and in turn improve TB control. Our proposal seeks to describe safety profiles of 3HP, completion rates and the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of 3HP-related ADRs for people receiving TPT at programmatic level. This study will take place in five health facilities in Uganda in collaboration with the National TB program and the National Drug Authority. We will conduct a cohort study where 614 adults and children >2 years, who have been initiated on 3HP for TPT by the facility clinician according to standard of care will be enrolled. Participants will be both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected. Participants will be followed up monthly for evaluation for ADRs using a standardized questionnaires, clinical evaluation and laboratory tests (liver function testing). For a subset of 300 patients (150 cases who develop grade 2 and above ADRs and 150 controls who do not experience ADRs), we will conduct pharmacokinetic sampling to measure rifapentine and isoniazid concentrations and selected genotyping (for examples N-Acetyl Transferase, Cytochrome 2E1) and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. We will use pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic-pharmacodynamic models and stochastic gradient boosted machine learning together with conventional statistical methods to determine factors associated with ADRs and simple prediction rules for the identification of patients at high risk for ADR. We will also determine the effect of the ADRs on TPT completion rates. Patients will subsequently be followed up for up to 3 years and assessed for TB reactivation according to standard of care to determine the incidence of TB reactivation in patients who have received 3HP and the risk factors for this. This study will provide data on the safety of 3HP during national roll-out and provide information on who is likely to develop ADRs which can affect treatment completion and therefore may benefit from alternative regimens. Study Narrative: This project will describe the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic determinants of adverse drug reactions among people receiving 3HP for TPT in Uganda. The results of this study will inform clinical decisions for identifying patients at high risk for adverse drug reactions related to 3HP in the African setting.",Clinical Predictors of weekly Rifapentine/isoniazid related adverse drug reactions during national roll-out of tuberculosis preventive therapy,10217331,R01AI160434,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Cytochromes', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health care facility', 'Hypotension', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Interruption', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Questionnaires', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transferase', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'Vision', 'World Health Organization', 'adverse drug reaction', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'authority', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'experience', 'flu', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'human leukocyte antigen testing', 'improved', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'pharmacodynamic model', 'prevent', 'programs', 'reactivation from latency', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'rifapentine', 'scale up', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'uptake']",NIAID,INFECTIOUS DISEASES INSTITUTE,R01,2021,138370
"Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign Project Summary/Abstract Written The objective of the proposed research is to reduce the patient safety hazards associated with electronic medication administration records (eMARs) by, (1) understanding current usability and safety gaps, and (2) creating design and development documents, wireframes, and prototypes to serve as the foundation for future eMARs that will eliminate these gaps. In particular, we focus on communication and information flow challenges between nurses, pharmacists, and physicians during medication administration and use of the eMAR. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-16-009). We will develop a broad understanding of usability and safety hazards associated with eMARs by analyzing a large dataset of 1.7 million patient safety event reports and detailed medication error related narratives. We will then conduct heuristic analyses of current eMARs, and interviews and observations of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. These data will serve to inform the development of eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes as the foundation for future development. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health information technology (health IT), informatics, and data science. Our research team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and human factors engineers, and experts in natural language processing. In addition, our partnerships include a patient safety organization and a health IT vendor. The proposal addresses fundamental aspects of the call for proposals by providing new insights on the safety of health IT and improves current practices by developing use cases and new prototypes for immediate use by healthIT vendors. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the role of health IT during medication administration with a focus on communication and information flow, design, development and testing documents for vendors and providers, and eMAR wireframes and prototypes to improve development. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with medication related test scenarios to assess current health IT systems. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the sciences of human factors and informatics to improve the usability and safety of the electronic medication administration records (eMARs), which will ultimately improve patient care. Patient safety event report data will be analyzed to identify usability and safety hazards in eMARs, and interviews and observations will be conducted to identify clinician needs. Based on this knowledge eMAR design documents, wireframes, and prototypes will be developed, tested, and disseminated with the goal of improving communication and information flow to reduce medication related errors.",Improving Patient Safety and Clinician Cognitive Support Through eMAR Redesign,10141229,R01HS025136,[' '],AHRQ,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,392540
"Clinical trial emulation to assess drug safety in pregnant patients ABSTRACT Pregnant people are a vulnerable population: healthcare professionals must exercise caution in prescribing many common pharmaceuticals to expectant patients, given potential risk of injury to a developing fetus. Arguably, teratogenicity is the most serious manifestation of fetal toxicity, as teratogens lead to fetal malformation and are implicated in physical and mental disabilities throughout the life course of an affected child. Consideration of teratogenicity, however, is a largely nonsystematic process. While regulatory agencies like the United States Food and Drug Administration have established discrete teratogenicity scores for evaluating drug safety, these classification criteria provide little concrete distinction among score classes, making it difficult for pharmaceutical scientists to systematically determine the teratogenic potential of a drug. This effect ripples to the bedside, as providers lack robust data on most drugs to inform their judgements of safety, efficacy, and risk in recommending therapies to expectant patients. Consequently, treatment of many diseases during pregnancy remains understudied and uncertain, for fear of causing harm. To address these shortcomings and improve quality of care for pregnant patients and their unborn children, we propose the development of a holistic, generalizable framework for the identification of teratogenic drug exposures via a new paradigm of clinical pharmacovigilance. Therefore, given our inability to evaluate drug safety in pregnant patients in real time, the objective of our investigation is to develop an observational platform to uncover new drug safety information through strategic, associative analysis of medication history within the electronic health record (EHR) of a pregnant patient and developmental diseases within the EHRs of their neonates. This approach will harness 48,434 linked maternal and neonatal EHRs within the Research Derivative, a databank of identified EHRs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, across which we plan to apply and appropriately validate a medication-wide association study to uncover new, data-driven associations between maternal medication exposures and teratogenic health outcomes. To date, we have employed this technique to discover 129 associations between maternal drug exposure and neurodevelopmental diseases from existing primary care data, which recapitulate teratogens well-known to clinical practice that also serve as positive controls for our model. Now, we hope to expand our platform to encompass more advanced techniques of clinical trial emulation; if successful, we anticipate that discovering new toxicants through retrospective data modeling will greatly enhance our goal of systematically clarifying cases of suspect drug safety in pregnancy. In the long run, we hope this approach will allow clinicians to embrace a more accurate knowledge base in their evaluation of the risks and benefits in prescribing drugs with unclear teratogenic risks to their pregnant patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE From the perspective of regulatory agencies for public health and safety, it is unethical to perform clinical trials on pregnant people to assess drug safety and efficacy for the treatment of diseases of pregnancy; paradoxically, while this policy recognizes the vulnerability of an expectant mother and her unborn child, it has created a public health emergency for millions of pregnant patients, as clinicians lack robust data on treatments for these conditions and still do not know whether many common drugs are safe to prescribe to their pregnant patients. To address these problems, this project aims to harness the burgeoning science of machine learning to create a surrogate for randomized, controlled drug trials in pregnant populations, via the development of a “target trial” platform to discover new drug safety and efficacy insights from medication and disease data in linked maternal and neonatal electronic health records that were originally collected during routine medical care. Upon completion of this project, pharmaceutical scientists may employ the resulting target trial framework to clarify drug safety concerns for pregnant patients, and clinicians may benefit more definitive data in their choice of safe and effective medications for expectant mothers.",Clinical trial emulation to assess drug safety in pregnant patients,10232840,R21HD105304,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Birth', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Fetal Development', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infant Care', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Orphan', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Thalidomide', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Upper Extremity', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data repository', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'human data', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'loss of function', 'malformation', 'medication safety', 'neonate', 'novel therapeutics', 'pharmacovigilance', 'phenome', 'point of care', 'preclinical study', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'simulation', 'toxicant', 'unborn child', 'unethical']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,259500
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project aims to make healthcare safer through collection of patient-centered outcomes as the input data to support a safety and improvement model of the Learning Health System (LHS). The project will accomplish these aims by leveraging existing machine learning methods to classify free text documents, such as clinician notes, for the presence or absence of specific events of interest. The project shares this focus with two long-term objectives. The first broad project goal is to collect important data to address knowledge gaps in the incidence and clinical epidemiology of 5 serious pediatric inpatient healthcare acquired conditions (HACs). These 5 HACs are: peripheral IV infiltrates, venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), pressure injuries, patient falls, and incidents involving harm to providers. The second goal is to evaluate a novel approach to routine patient safety event surveillance that is scalable, transferrable, adaptable to other conditions and settings, and with low cost of sustainable ongoing operation. The project has two specific aims to achieve these goals:  Aim 1: Implement enhanced surveillance for 5 pediatric HACs. Compare characteristics  of previously and newly identified cases. Describe high-risk populations.  Aim 2: Estimate completeness of existing systems. Evaluate effects of enhanced  surveillance on quality improvement activities; incidence of HACs; and cost to operate  system, including staff time and resources. The project team has developed a machine learning interface implemented in open license Windows software. The team has a lengthy track record making these methods accessible to clinicians and lay users in research, clinical operations, quality improvement, and injury prevention settings. The current project proposes an innovative application of these technologies, methods, and tools to the important problem of patient safety surveillance. An expected outcome of this project will be substantial advance in knowledge for each of the 5 pediatric HACs proposed for enhanced surveillance. Results will be reported in terms of existing data completeness and clinical epidemiology. Findings will directly address concerns over limitations of existing data sources and thereby drive patient safety improvement activities. An additional expected outcome will be the rigorous evaluation of a novel approach to patient safety surveillance. This will include analysis of the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance with machine learning versus current approaches, and the cost-effectiveness of the approach compared to reliance on existing data, and external validation at a partner community hospital. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project addresses important challenges to reduce common sources of harm in pediatric healthcare, namely the “Healthcare-Acquired Conditions (HACs)” monitored by the National Solutions for Patient Safety quality improvement initiative. It uses a new approach to identify previously unreported safety events that affect hospitalized pediatric patients. The findings from these studies will identify high-risk patient populations and new approaches for quality improvement to reduce the frequency of these events of harm among hospitalized children.",Patient Safety Event Surveillance Using Machine Learning and Free Text Clinical Notes,10202727,R01HS026246,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,396733
"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images African American and Latinx communities nationally and in California not only bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths but are also not taking part in COVID-19 testing for a wide range of understudied reasons. This can have profound implications in safety net health care settings where vulnerable patients, who are in need of clinical procedures to prevent significant morbidity, are refusing such potentially lifesaving procedures because of fear of COVID-19 testing and/or contracting COVID-19. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the second largest publicly operated county safety net health care system in the United States, serving more than 750,000 patients annually. Timely access to health care in this under-resourced, high-need setting has been an ongoing challenge for its majority Latinx and African American patients. With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why patients refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. To this end, we propose to explore the obstacles to COVID-19 pre- procedural testing and provide COVID-19 specific training to LACDHS Community Health Workers (CHWs) from these same communities to effectively address: a) the primary goal of increasing COVID-19 testing for individual patients, and the secondary goals of b) facilitating needed procedural care in a timely manner for the safety net health system, and c) developing a sustained public health presence in these communities to build trust and preparedness for critical COVID-19 related future needs. Trained CHWs can help to more effectively overcome obstacles to COVID-19 testing, including historical barriers of mistrust, provide COVID-19 health education, help address social determinants of health and help facilitate technological literacy to improve patient access to testing and care in a telehealth environment. The proposal uses a multidisciplinary, mixed- methods approach including unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to systematically explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing among vulnerable safety net patients. We will then train clinically based, ethnically/linguistically matched CHWs to implement a hypothesis-driven intervention consisting of six group classes and six personalized patient encounters with African American and Latinx safety net patients. This study has the following specific aims: Aim 1- Utilize machine learning methods to assess whether there are characteristics that define African American and Latinx safety-net patients who engage in or refuse COVID-19 testing; Aim 2 - Conduct in-depth interviews with African American and Latinx patients who either declined or accepted COVID testing to explore contextual, behavioral, and attitudinal factors shaping patient circumstances and concerns; Aim 3 - Develop, implement, and pre-test a CHW intervention with the information from Aims 1 and 2, utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients to assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing. Project Narrative With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why vulnerable patients in safety net health care settings refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. This grant is an innovative proposal that seeks to (1) bring together machine learning and behavioral methods to understand the reasons why Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) safety net patients who require COVID-19 testing for procedures refuse or accept COVID-19 testing, and (2) utilize the knowledge gleaned to implement a Community Health Worker (CHW)-based intervention, using LACDHS CHWs, that addresses the multilevel obstacles to COVID- 19 testing. Insights gained from this research may be of benefit to improve COVID-19 uptake in other similar safety net settings with CHWs and in planning the future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in such medically underserved settings.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,10258973,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavioral', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 testing', 'COVID-19 vaccine', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Health Services', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health education', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Housing', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'PhenX Toolkit', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Religion', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccines', 'Weighing patient', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'economic need', 'health care availability', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'literacy', 'machine learning method', 'medically underserved', 'multidisciplinary', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'skills', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'telehealth', 'testing access', 'testing uptake', 'unsupervised learning', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance', 'virtual intervention', 'virtual patient']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,10136717,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'rosiglitazone', 'safety outcomes', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,328000
"Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS Project Summary Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health interventions to date. They are, however, pharmaceutical products that carry risks. Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine- preventable illnesses. The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains up to 30,000 reports per year over the past 25 years. VAERS reports include both structured data (e.g., vaccination date, first onset date, age, and gender) and unstructured narratives that often provide detailed clinical information about the clinical events and the temporal relationship of the series of event occurrences post vaccination. The structured data only provide one onsite date whereas temporal information of the sequence of events post vaccination is contained in the unstructured narratives. Current status –While structured data in the VAERS are widely used, the narratives are generally ignored because of the challenges inherent in working with unstructured data. Without these narratives, potentially valuable information is lost. Goals - In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Specifically, built upon the state-of-art ontology and natural language processing technologies, we will develop and validate a Temporal Information Modeling, Extraction and Reasoning system for Vaccine data (TIMER-V), which will automatically extract post-vaccination events and their temporal relationships from VAERS reports, semantically infer temporal relations, and integrate the exacted unstructured data with the structured data. Furthermore, we will provide and maintain a publicly available data access interface to query the new integrated data repository, which will facilitate vaccine safety research, casual inference, and other temporal related discovery. We will also develop and validate models to predict severe AEs using the co-occurrence or temporal patterns of the series of AEs post vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make use of the unstructured narratives in the VAERS reports to facilitate the temporal related discovery to a broad community of investigators in pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, vaccine safety research, among others. Project Narrative Effective analyses of post-vaccination adverse events (AEs) is vital to assuring the safety of vaccines, a key public health intervention for reducing the frequency of vaccine-preventable illnesses. In response to the FOA, PA-15-312, this proposed project focuses on the specific objective on “creation/evaluation of statistical methodologies for analyzing data on vaccine safety, including data available from existing data sources such as passive reporting systems or healthcare databases”. Currently the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) only includes one onsite date in its database. The textual narratives in the reports are generally ignored primarily due to their unstructured nature. These narratives, however, contain more detailed information about the series of events that happened after vaccination, which could be valuable for more informed clinical studies. We propose to develop a novel framework to extract and accurately interpret the temporal information contained in the narratives through informatics approaches, and to develop prediction models for risk of severe AEs. Our new methods, their applications to VAERS database, and their dissemination will facilitate the entire research network for pursuing temporal related discovery with high methodological rigor.",Dynamic learning for post-vaccine event prediction using temporal information in VAERS,10097968,R01AI130460,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'base', 'data access', 'data repository', 'detection method', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'information model', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'unstructured data', 'vaccine safety']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,669017
"Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance Project Summary Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. It is only after a drug is marketed and used on a more widespread basis over longer periods of time that it is possible to identify other effects, such as rare but serious adverse effects, or those that are more common in the special subgroups excluded from the trial (such as pregnant women), or effects of long-term use of the drug, among others. Despite the increase in research in the past years exploring social media data for pharmacovigilance, and the evidence that it indeed can bring forward the patient perspective, there is no systematic approach to collect and annotate such data for research purposes. This renewal builds on our prior research and natural language processing (NLP) methods for social media mining in pharmacovigilance to make the collection of social media data about medication use precise and systematic enough to be useful to researchers and the public, alongside established sources such as the FDA's data and other public collections of drug adverse event data. It presents innovative methods to automatically collect and analyze longitudinal health data, piloting methods for interventions through the same media that can inform the public and help validate the automatic methods. As validation, we include a comparison to an existing reference standard for adverse effects that integrates FDA's data and HER data, as well as specific case studies focused on (Aim 3.1) the use of NSAIDs and anti-depressants in pregnancy and (Aim 3.2) factors for non-adherence.
