"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies. We propose to integrate computational modeling with functional genomics techniques to refine the immunotherapy response biomarkers, identify novel regulators of immunotherapy response, and elucidate their underlying mechanisms, with the potential to improve immunotherapy response.",Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response,9818071,R01CA234018,"['4T1', 'ATAC-seq', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'CT26', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cell-Mediated Cytolysis', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Exclusion', 'Expression Profiling', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Interferon Type II', 'Knock-out', 'Libraries', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Regulator Genes', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Statistical Models', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'anti-CTLA4', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'genomic profiles', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune checkpoint blockers', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'web server']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2019,497881,0.05051973914678464
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9613818,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,188952,0.00559642165118164
"Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  Knowledge from the recent clinical trials suggests that over 80% of head and neck cancer (HNC) are hypo-immunogenic cold tumors and non-responsive to immune checkpoint receptors (ICR) blockade. With the emerging combinatorial strategies for cold cancer, precise identification of this group of tumors is essential for the selection of optimal treatment protocols. However, there is no consistent algorithm available to assess the global immune profile of HNC. Most of the current immunoscore methods are based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a limited panel of biomarkers, which prevents a precise annotation of the landscape of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The IHC method is technically sensitive, and may present inter-institutional and inter-pathologists variations. Moreover, the current immunoscore only emphasizes on a few T-cell subsets, and does not integrate cancer genomic features that modulate tumor response to immune killing. In fact, strong evidence suggests that the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway plays a fundamental role in HNC response to effector immune cells. Thus, leveraging global TIL profiles and cancer genomic features offers an unprecedented opportunity to classify HNC based on its immunogenicity. The current robust methods for cellular deconvolution are sensitive to outliers, which are frequently observed in the whole tumor RNA-Seq datasets. Our recent studies show that a novel machine learning tool Fast And Robust DEconcolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), which adaptively detects and removes outliers, exhibits superior accuracy in immune cell deconvolution. In precise alignment with the FOA, the overarching hypothesis of this project is that a compound immunoscore integrating FARDEEP-assisted TIL deconvolution and cancer genomics can effectively identify cold HNC. To achieve this goal, our two immediate next steps are: **(1) We will develop a robust model-free approach to identify TIL-driving oncogenic pathways; **(2) We will construct a compound immunoscore integrating cancer genomic features and TIL profiles to identify cold HNC. These studies will develop a novel “statistical methodology appropriate for analyzing genome-wide data” and provide “statistical analysis of existing genome-wide data” for an NIDCR priority disease. This project will refine a robust and novel immune-cell deconvolution machine learning tool and characterize central oncogenic pathways that shift the TIL landscape. The new immunogenomics algorithms will streamline the immunoscoring method to effectively stratify HNC and contribute to the precision selection of combinatorial treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The immune microenvironment holds strong potential to complement the current head and neck cancer (HNC) staging system for more effective patient stratification. But the current immunoscores, which depict the infiltration of some subsets of T cells, are limited by the number of evaluated immune-cell subsets and exclusion of biomarkers for cancer sensitivity to immune killing. In this project, we will refine our unique robust methods to integrate global tumor-infiltrating immune cells with cancer genomics, constructing a compound immunoscore for the precise identification of hypo-immunogenic HNC.",Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer,9766266,R03DE027399,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infiltration', 'Institution', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte Subset', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'checkpoint receptors', 'chemoradiation', 'combinatorial', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'immune checkpoint', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inter-institutional', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic performance', 'public health relevance', 'receptor expression', 'recruit', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2019,161997,0.04751541939828377
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9788340,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'actionable mutation', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2019,228089,0.04808574631373678
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer. This mission will be realized through analysis, integration and visualization of multi-omic datasets including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data collected from patient samples to develop predictive models, and during drug treatment of patient derived xenografts and cell lines to validate mechanisms.",Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation,9768977,U24CA210972,"['Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Signal Pathway', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'assay development', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'candidate marker', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data pipeline', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'protein metabolite', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U24,2019,602582,0.04102029763828666
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"A Software Platform for the Identification of Cell Surface Antigens Using RNA-seq Data Human monoclonal antibodies are among the fastest growing therapeutic modalities, with over sixty compounds approved by FDA to treat infections, autoimmunity, chronic inflammation and cancer. In combination, these diseases are responsible for the deaths of 50 million people annually, according to the World Health Organization. However, the advent of therapeutic immunologics is expected to significantly reduce the associated morbidity and mortality, particularly for oncologic diseases. Currently, 15 immuno-oncologic (IO) treatments are commercially available and comprise a growing market that is expected to reach $100B by 2022. IO therapeutics effectively attack cancer by selectively binding tumor-specific protein domains on the cell surface, referred to as tumor-associated ectodomains (TAEs). However, many cancers remain insensitive to available IO as effective and safe TAEs are difficult to identify. Standard methods to detect TAEs are costly, time-consuming and limited in their ability to discover novel targets, necessitating the development of innovative technologies to circumvent this burden. RNAseq is currently the most effective method to discover novel splicing isoforms, is high-throughput, sensitive and inexpensive. Envisagenics has been at the forefront of RNAseq- based splicing characterization since the release of its SpliceCore® platform. Here, we propose to develop SpliceIO, a novel drug discovery platform that integrates the Envisagenics’ SpliceCore knowledge base with machine learning algorithms to enable rapid identification of aberrant splicing-derived TAEs using RNAseq data. In this Phase I SBIR proposal, we will develop and apply SpliceIO in the context of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, a cancer particularly resistant to IO but highly associated with splicing mis-regulation and mutations within key spliceosome components. We will identify and validate TAEs in vitro using established leukemia cell lines and patient-derived bone marrow aspirates in collaboration with Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Collectively, the aims outlined herein will allow us to both develop and validate a novel splicing-dependent TAE identification platform to provide new sources of drug targets while dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with their development. In addition, this will allow Envisagenics to create new partnership opportunities for IO co- development with pharmaceutical companies. If successful, this pipeline can be used to identify drug targets and/or biomarkers for patient stratification in cancer and inflammatory diseases in the context of an SBIR Phase II grant. Despite the recent success of immune-based treatments in melanoma, the majority of cancers remain insensitive and resistant to therapy, necessitating the development of approaches to rapidly identify novel drug targets. Here, we propose to build a target discovery platform that combines our proprietary database of RNA splicing mutations in cancers with machine learning to identify the most clinically-relevant targets for subsequent drug development.",A Software Platform for the Identification of Cell Surface Antigens Using RNA-seq Data,9909639,R43CA246950,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antibodies', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', 'Cell surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Grant', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense-Mediated Decay', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Databases', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Tumor-Derived', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'immunogenic', 'innovative technologies', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'response', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,"ENVISAGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,301502,0.01837491831477764
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology.

"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,9609431,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2019,317385,0.01665744587225797
"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. The functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist.",High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors,9647173,K22CA234406,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR screen', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Faculty', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guide RNA', 'Heterogeneity', 'K22 Award', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer cell line', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug development', 'druggable target', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'homologous recombination', 'individual patient', 'irinotecan', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'mouse model', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oxaliplatin', 'precision oncology', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'targeted agent', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K22,2019,192240,0.05854588434062345
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,9743114,K99CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K99,2019,134632,0.041515293249729884
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9747360,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,531751,0.04752969870502473
"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets. These data can also be applied to other types of immunotherapy as we will also test. Cancer is a disease of the aged, but therapies are generally modeled in the young. We study age effects on cancer immunotherapy in response to PQ2 to develop ways to optimize cancer immunotherapy in aged patients most at risk. We focus on the PD-L1/PD-1 axis that is the cornerstone of the most successful cancer immunotherapies to date.",(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy,9788318,R01CA231325,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Appearance', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Genes', 'Genetically Modified Animals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell dimension', 'cohort', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune function', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'nano-string', 'neoplasm immunotherapy', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'preclinical study', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'ultra high resolution']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2019,530090,0.03274245025256791
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism.

"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9663912,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'effector T cell', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2019,2067796,0.041586338824026986
"A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE While coding cancer driver mutations have been characterized in detail over the past decade, the contribution of noncoding mutations to tumor formation remains - apart from few examples (e.g. mutations in TERT promoters) - largely unknown. Recently, large-scale whole-genome sequencing datasets have been made available, but a major bottleneck for the biological and clinical interpretation of these cancer whole-genome cohorts is the lack of statistical models that identify driver mutations in noncoding regions. We developed a new statistical approach that characterizes driver mutations based on their surrounding nucleotide context in coding regions, and herein we propose a concrete plan to generalize our computational model to noncoding regions, apply our model to aggregated whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients (PCAWG, HMF datasets), and define the noncoding driver and passenger mutational landscape for biological discovery and focused clinical application.",A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions,9825986,R21CA242861,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Attention', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated RNA', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenicity', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predicting response', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'reference genome', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2019,232291,0.017048629884119225
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9765042,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,530736,0.07896774037790455
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community.

"Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology and to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory effects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across multiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and animal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of projects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT (HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and durvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the mechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining dendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of resistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in Projects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a state-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to drive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer. Overall Narrative Our goal is to demonstrate that the immune stimulatory effects of radiation therapy (RT) can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with CTLA-4 and PD-1 across multiple histologies. Our approach involves two immediate clinical trials, mechanistic studies in human samples, mechanistic and discovery studies in mouse models, and sharing of data and scientific insight between 3 Projects and 3 Cores. The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.  ",Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy,9773984,P01CA210944,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Discipline', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Dose', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Local Therapy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nivolumab', 'PD-1 blockade', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Pancreatic carcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Interaction', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiobiology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'immune activation', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'irradiation', 'lung Carcinoma', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'preclinical efficacy', 'programs', 'radiation effect', 'radiation response', 'randomized trial', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'success', 'synergism', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P01,2019,2286184,0.031436034860910775
"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong.

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9759874,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2019,399937,0.034723691078375626
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,9713119,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'oncology', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,341598,0.063447117103408
"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9840425,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'oncology', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,496626,-0.006150851898615752
"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,9737246,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stem cells', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2019,336177,0.014661952181483034
"Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, resulting in dramatic anti-tumor responses in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% show any survival benefit, and of these it is not clear what predicts response. ICIs have been thought to work primarily through reactivation of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CD8s) residing within the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Recent work, however, indicates that various CD4+ T cell populations outside the tumor microenvironment (peripheral immune system) likely play critical roles in carrying out anti-tumor immune responses. Given increasing evidence that immune cells other than CD8s are important for anti-tumor immunity, it is critical to identify and characterize these cells in order to understand their roles during HNSCC tumorigenesis and ICI therapy, which are currently unknown. This proposal by Dr. Kyle Jones, DDS, PhD seeks to significantly advance our understanding of cancer immunology in the context of HNSCC tumors, with the ultimate goal of improving existing ICI therapies and developing new treatment strategies. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, he will use a novel systems biology approach to accomplish the following Aims: (AIM 1) Quantify the effects that HNSCC tumors have on systemic immunity and determine if these changes are conserved across tumor, blood, and regional lymph nodes; (AIM 2) Determine how the ICI atezolizumab alters the intratumoral and peripheral immune states of HNSCC patients and if these changes are associated with tumor response to therapy. These Aims will define how HNSCC tumors alter the composition and function of patients' immune systems at single cell and systems levels as well as identify/characterize the specific immune cells that contribute to anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones will use high throughput single-cell methods such as mass cytometry, multiplexed ion beam imaging, and single-cell RNAseq along with established analytic pipelines on HNSCC patient specimens obtained before and after ICI therapy. The innovation of this approach, which permits simultaneous study of all immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, will reveal how changes in any individual immune cell population affects the overall immune state. It will also be important for the discovery of additional immune cell populations and biomarkers associated with HNSCC anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones's long-term career goal is to become an expert, leader, and independent translational scientist in the fields of head and neck cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Through this K23 award, he will obtain the additional training in experimental immunology, single cell analysis methods, computer programming, advanced statistical methods, and career development he needs to successfully achieve this goal.

"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments.

"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9743120,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2019,692707,0.04001800376014619
"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9671372,R37CA218570,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Canis familiaris', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dog family', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Silicones', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Veterinarians', 'actionable mutation', 'analysis pipeline', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'citizen science', 'classifier algorithm', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational cancer research', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2019,634586,0.012027890807111113
"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,9827695,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,392987,0.02260941331911733
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,9614864,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,394948,0.040207416560164466
"Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  Knowledge from the recent clinical trials suggests that over 80% of head and neck cancer (HNC) are hypo-immunogenic cold tumors and non-responsive to immune checkpoint receptors (ICR) blockade. With the emerging combinatorial strategies for cold cancer, precise identification of this group of tumors is essential for the selection of optimal treatment protocols. However, there is no consistent algorithm available to assess the global immune profile of HNC. Most of the current immunoscore methods are based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a limited panel of biomarkers, which prevents a precise annotation of the landscape of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The IHC method is technically sensitive, and may present inter-institutional and inter-pathologists variations. Moreover, the current immunoscore only emphasizes on a few T-cell subsets, and does not integrate cancer genomic features that modulate tumor response to immune killing. In fact, strong evidence suggests that the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway plays a fundamental role in HNC response to effector immune cells. Thus, leveraging global TIL profiles and cancer genomic features offers an unprecedented opportunity to classify HNC based on its immunogenicity. The current robust methods for cellular deconvolution are sensitive to outliers, which are frequently observed in the whole tumor RNA-Seq datasets. Our recent studies show that a novel machine learning tool Fast And Robust DEconcolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), which adaptively detects and removes outliers, exhibits superior accuracy in immune cell deconvolution. In precise alignment with the FOA, the overarching hypothesis of this project is that a compound immunoscore integrating FARDEEP-assisted TIL deconvolution and cancer genomics can effectively identify cold HNC. To achieve this goal, our two immediate next steps are: **(1) We will develop a robust model-free approach to identify TIL-driving oncogenic pathways; **(2) We will construct a compound immunoscore integrating cancer genomic features and TIL profiles to identify cold HNC. These studies will develop a novel “statistical methodology appropriate for analyzing genome-wide data” and provide “statistical analysis of existing genome-wide data” for an NIDCR priority disease. This project will refine a robust and novel immune-cell deconvolution machine learning tool and characterize central oncogenic pathways that shift the TIL landscape. The new immunogenomics algorithms will streamline the immunoscoring method to effectively stratify HNC and contribute to the precision selection of combinatorial treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The immune microenvironment holds strong potential to complement the current head and neck cancer (HNC) staging system for more effective patient stratification. But the current immunoscores, which depict the infiltration of some subsets of T cells, are limited by the number of evaluated immune-cell subsets and exclusion of biomarkers for cancer sensitivity to immune killing. In this project, we will refine our unique robust methods to integrate global tumor-infiltrating immune cells with cancer genomics, constructing a compound immunoscore for the precise identification of hypo-immunogenic HNC.",Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer,9598702,R03DE027399,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infiltration', 'Institution', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte Subset', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'checkpoint receptors', 'chemoradiation', 'combinatorial', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'immune checkpoint', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inter-institutional', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic performance', 'public health relevance', 'receptor expression', 'recruit', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2018,176339,0.04751541939828377
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9433637,K00CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2018,73814,0.03530279207478237
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9646469,K08CA234458,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'actionable mutation', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2018,68267,0.04808574631373678
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer.

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,9549013,U24CA210990,"['Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North Carolina', 'Oncogenic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Subtype', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'exceptional responders', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient response', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2018,449240,0.07642225475218806
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9428444,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'molecular imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,188952,0.00559642165118164
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9547124,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,552250,0.07896774037790455
"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,9472091,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2018,327546,0.01665744587225797
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The integration of a machine-learning algorithm will further provide precise and unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor ecosystem.",Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems,9568743,U01CA214411,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bioreactors', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cetuximab', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glucose', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Rest', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Derived', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'cytokine', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fluid flow', 'genetic profiling', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'protein B', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2018,754767,0.043545917853715504
"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,9787830,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immuno-Chemotherapy', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunology procedure', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon Alfa-2b', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Program Development', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic cell death', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2018,500000,0.04070031987065596
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,9582884,K99CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K99,2018,134632,0.041515293249729884
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9525436,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2018,541146,0.04752969870502473
"Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center) SUMMARY-ABSTRACT  The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre- malignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre- melanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to myeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as shaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the Center for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary technical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision prevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the molecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk individuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials. This will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex tissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.  Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination with HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with three subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists and a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological specimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository will provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in prospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an oncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high- plex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate reagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications. Aim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to manage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most technically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each in preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm development. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new scientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the incidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood. NARRATIVE Construction of Pre-Cancer Atlases comprising detailed spatial and molecular data on cell state and omic data in melanoma and clonal hematopoiesis will join together the two primary means of diagnosing human cancer: histology and genetics. The atlases we construct will help to identify patients with pre-cancer skin lesions and blood conditions at risk of progressing to malignancy at a sufficiently early stage that aggressive disease can be prevented.",Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center),9627416,U2CCA233262,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Histology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Oncologist', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention therapy', 'Prevention trial', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Skin Cancer', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Stromal Cells', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'crowdsourcing', 'data acquisition', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep neural network', 'dimensional analysis', 'genetic analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'image visualization', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'laser capture microdissection', 'learning strategy', 'melanoma', 'member', 'neoplastic', 'new technology', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'prospective', 'repository', 'skin lesion', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U2C,2018,6918530,0.004369696335253775
"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets. These data can also be applied to other types of immunotherapy as we will also test. Cancer is a disease of the aged, but therapies are generally modeled in the young. We study age effects on cancer immunotherapy in response to PQ2 to develop ways to optimize cancer immunotherapy in aged patients most at risk. We focus on the PD-L1/PD-1 axis that is the cornerstone of the most successful cancer immunotherapies to date.",(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy,9592156,R01CA231325,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Appearance', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Genes', 'Genetically Modified Animals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell dimension', 'cohort', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune function', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'nano-string', 'neoplasm immunotherapy', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'preclinical study', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'ultra high resolution']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2018,582917,0.03274245025256791
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community.

"Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology and to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory effects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across multiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and animal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of projects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT (HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and durvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the mechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining dendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of resistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in Projects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a state-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to drive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer. Overall Narrative Our goal is to demonstrate that the immune stimulatory effects of radiation therapy (RT) can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with CTLA-4 and PD-1 across multiple histologies. Our approach involves two immediate clinical trials, mechanistic studies in human samples, mechanistic and discovery studies in mouse models, and sharing of data and scientific insight between 3 Projects and 3 Cores. The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.  ",Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy,9531295,P01CA210944,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Discipline', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Dose', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Local Therapy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'PD-1 blockade', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Pancreatic carcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Interaction', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiobiology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'immune activation', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'irradiation', 'lung Carcinoma', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'preclinical efficacy', 'programs', 'radiation effect', 'radiation response', 'randomized trial', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'success', 'synergism', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P01,2018,2311469,0.031436034860910775
"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9571234,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,550445,0.034723691078375626
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9475020,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2018,2147606,0.041586338824026986
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9487202,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'early screening', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2018,347700,0.012874170604600433
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9577958,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2018,737882,0.04001800376014619
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments.

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9410769,K00CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2017,71064,0.03530279207478237
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer. This mission will be realized through analysis, integration and visualization of multi-omic datasets including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data collected from patient samples to develop predictive models, and during drug treatment of patient derived xenografts and cell lines to validate mechanisms.",Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation,9353354,U24CA210972,"['Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Signal Pathway', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'assay development', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'candidate marker', 'clinical development', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'protein metabolite', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U24,2017,624613,0.04102029763828666
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9147605,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'molecular imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'response biomarker', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,188952,0.00559642165118164
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9349466,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,542768,0.07896774037790455
"An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA PROJECT SUMMARY Recent studies revealed that the human genome encodes thousands of lncRNAs with little proteincoding capacity. LncRNAs were shown to play important roles in cancer and are potentially a new class of therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the function of the vast majority of lncRNAs in cancer remains unknown. LncRNA function often depends on its physical interactions with protein complexes. They can also influence the abundance of other mRNAs that are targeted by the same microRNAs by competing for microRNA binding, i.e., serving as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Advances in genomic technologies, especially those based on next generation sequencing (NGS), provide unparalleled opportunities to characterize the functional networks of lncRNA in cancer. However, analysis and integration of different types of genomic datasets to generate testable hypotheses is challenging, and systematic approaches to characterize lncRNA function in cancer are lacking. This application describes the development of computational methods and integrative genomic strategies for systematically dissecting the functional network of lncRNA in cancer, and a combination of computational and experimental approaches to unravel several important functional networks of lncRNA in prostate cancer. Specifically, it will (1) develop a computational method for repurposing the publically available array-based data to interrogate lncRNA expression in tumor samples and utilize an integrative genomic strategy to predict lncRNAs that may be important for tumorigenesis/tumor suppression in prostate cancer via analysis of lncRNA expression profiles, clinical information and somatic genomic alteration profiles of tumor samples, (2) identify the lncRNAs that are associated with EZH2 or direct transcriptional targets of EZH2 repression that are important for prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression, and (3) identify the ceRNAs of AR and PTEN that mediate prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression. In addition to its scientific proposal, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in the fields of computational genomics, noncoding RNA and cancer, who develops cutting-edge computational methods, and uses a combination of computational and experimental approaches to understand structure-function relationship of noncoding RNA and the function of noncoding RNA and RNA-protein interaction in cancer. While the candidate of this application has received extensive training in biophysics, statistics, machine learning and computational genomics, this career development award will allow him to develop his experimental skills, especially those next-generation sequencing-based techniques and molecular biology experiments in human cell lines. Dr. Liu, Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Dr. Brown, Professor of Medicine will mentor the candidate in the excellent training environment of Dana Farber Cancer Institute, a part of Harvard Medical School community. A committee of experienced computational and cancer biologists will also advise him on both scientific research and career development. The proposed study is to decipher lncRNA function in cancer using a combination of novel computational methods and high-throughput experimental technologies. The proposed research will result in publically available bioinformatic resources for studying lncRNA function in cancer, a greater understanding of IncRNA function in prostate cancer, and will help to discover novel therapeutic target of lncRNA for treating prostate cancer.",An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA,9207429,R00CA175290,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Biophysics', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exons', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTEN gene', 'Play', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'RNA', 'RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'career development', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'mRNA Expression', 'medical schools', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'professor', 'prostate carcinogenesis', 'protein complex', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R00,2017,221939,-0.02020390737025462
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance. The Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC) will develop quantitative approaches to understand, study and find potential novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of solid tumors.        Average Scores of the Components:    Overall:			2.7    Project 1:			2.7    Project 2:			2.3    Project 3:			4.3    Resource Core 1:		2.2    Education and Outreach:	2.9            ",Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity,9263901,U54CA193313,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug resistance', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Institution', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'New York', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bcr-abl Fusion Proteins', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genomic profiles', 'high dimensionality', 'imprint', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'leukemia', 'mathematical methods', 'metropolitan', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'physical science', 'pressure', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single cell sequencing', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2017,2087754,0.0510412413040887
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,9323323,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatologic', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunology procedure', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon Alfa-2b', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Program Development', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2017,2350000,0.04070031987065596
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9333447,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2017,544581,0.04752969870502473
"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale DCM: DA: ESCE: Discovering Molecular Processes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disease of the genome, caused by disruptions in a person's DNA. Orders of magnitude decreases in price and increases in sequencing throughput enabled sequencing of hundreds of genomes. This will launch a new phase bf ""Precision Medicine,"" where molecular markers can guide therapies tailored to patients. The genomics revolution is now systematically characterizing every somatic change in every tumor for large cohorts (>300 patients). Despite some successes, predicting cancer outcomes based on molecular signatures remains a major challenge. This proposal aims at obliterating several key roadblocks stymieing progress. First, the raw sequence data is not particularly well-suited for use in developing predictive models. Therefore, gene- and pathway-level evidence will be derived from CGHub to significantly increase the utility of the information for biomedical discovery. The information will be collected in a Social Graph technology framework like Facebook to scale to billions of interconnected objects called the Biomedical Evidence Graph (BMEG). Second, the datasets are so large they are impractical to move around on the internet. Thus, an environment will be created within which researchers can move their code to the vast amounts of data within the BMEG. Third, prediction challenges will be created based on cancer genomics datasets and patient outcomes. While there have been a few successes in predicting outcomes, current approaches suffer from reproducibility and robustness when applied to unseen data. This activity will reach a broad community of algorithm developers, promote transparency and sharing of bioinformatics code, and create a strong network effect to crowd-source the development of the best models for biological discovery. The system constructed will be focused around the investigation of cancer outcomes but the entire pipeline will be of general utility for any number of genome-based projects including investigating any number of disease, stem cell properties, model organisms, and genome-wide association studies. RELEVANCE (See instructions): While we are accumulating vast amounts of information on cancer cells, we are still searching in the dark for clues about predicting treatment strategies. It is of paramount importance to accelerate computational discovery. The creation of the BMEG will catalyze community participation to uncover novel relationships to elucidate new fundamental biology on oncogenesis and therapeutic directions for treating this disease. n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale DCM: DA: ESCE: Discovering Molecular Processes,9292292,R01CA180778,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Participation', 'DNA', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Level of Evidence', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Price', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'crowdsourcing', 'data management', 'e-science', 'genome wide association study', 'molecular marker', 'new technology', 'novel', 'online resource', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R01,2017,643668,0.0050035836066532864
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center.

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9388399,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,446226,0.034723691078375626
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9292041,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2017,347700,0.012874170604600433
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels, with the ultimate goal of informing the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.",The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC,9338202,U54CA209975,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Property', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'graduate student', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'live cell imaging', 'melanoma', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outreach program', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'undergraduate student']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U54,2017,2187373,0.08119565495593987
"Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology and to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory effects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across multiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and animal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of projects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT (HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and durvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the mechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining dendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of resistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in Projects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a state-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to drive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer. Overall Narrative Our goal is to demonstrate that the immune stimulatory effects of radiation therapy (RT) can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with CTLA-4 and PD-1 across multiple histologies. Our approach involves two immediate clinical trials, mechanistic studies in human samples, mechanistic and discovery studies in mouse models, and sharing of data and scientific insight between 3 Projects and 3 Cores. The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.  ",Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy,9208826,P01CA210944,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Discipline', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Dose', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Local Therapy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Pancreatic carcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Interaction', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiobiology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Viral', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical efficacy', 'data sharing', 'epigenomics', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'immune activation', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'irradiation', 'lung Carcinoma', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'radiation effect', 'radiation response', 'randomized trial', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'success', 'synergism', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P01,2017,2329233,0.031436034860910775
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9229841,F99CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor', 'tumor metabolism']",NCI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,F99,2016,32196,0.03530279207478237
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer. This mission will be realized through analysis, integration and visualization of multi-omic datasets including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data collected from patient samples to develop predictive models, and during drug treatment of patient derived xenografts and cell lines to validate mechanisms.",Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation,9210808,U24CA210972,"['Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Signal Pathway', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'assay development', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'protein metabolite', 'proteogenomics', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U24,2016,659453,0.04102029763828666
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9194067,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'genomic tools', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'precision medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,562825,0.07896774037790455
"An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA PROJECT SUMMARY Recent studies revealed that the human genome encodes thousands of lncRNAs with little proteincoding capacity. LncRNAs were shown to play important roles in cancer and are potentially a new class of therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the function of the vast majority of lncRNAs in cancer remains unknown. LncRNA function often depends on its physical interactions with protein complexes. They can also influence the abundance of other mRNAs that are targeted by the same microRNAs by competing for microRNA binding, i.e., serving as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Advances in genomic technologies, especially those based on next generation sequencing (NGS), provide unparalleled opportunities to characterize the functional networks of lncRNA in cancer. However, analysis and integration of different types of genomic datasets to generate testable hypotheses is challenging, and systematic approaches to characterize lncRNA function in cancer are lacking. This application describes the development of computational methods and integrative genomic strategies for systematically dissecting the functional network of lncRNA in cancer, and a combination of computational and experimental approaches to unravel several important functional networks of lncRNA in prostate cancer. Specifically, it will (1) develop a computational method for repurposing the publically available array-based data to interrogate lncRNA expression in tumor samples and utilize an integrative genomic strategy to predict lncRNAs that may be important for tumorigenesis/tumor suppression in prostate cancer via analysis of lncRNA expression profiles, clinical information and somatic genomic alteration profiles of tumor samples, (2) identify the lncRNAs that are associated with EZH2 or direct transcriptional targets of EZH2 repression that are important for prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression, and (3) identify the ceRNAs of AR and PTEN that mediate prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression. In addition to its scientific proposal, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in the fields of computational genomics, noncoding RNA and cancer, who develops cutting-edge computational methods, and uses a combination of computational and experimental approaches to understand structure-function relationship of noncoding RNA and the function of noncoding RNA and RNA-protein interaction in cancer. While the candidate of this application has received extensive training in biophysics, statistics, machine learning and computational genomics, this career development award will allow him to develop his experimental skills, especially those next-generation sequencing-based techniques and molecular biology experiments in human cell lines. Dr. Liu, Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Dr. Brown, Professor of Medicine will mentor the candidate in the excellent training environment of Dana Farber Cancer Institute, a part of Harvard Medical School community. A committee of experienced computational and cancer biologists will also advise him on both scientific research and career development. The proposed study is to decipher lncRNA function in cancer using a combination of novel computational methods and high-throughput experimental technologies. The proposed research will result in publically available bioinformatic resources for studying lncRNA function in cancer, a greater understanding of IncRNA function in prostate cancer, and will help to discover novel therapeutic target of lncRNA for treating prostate cancer.",An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA,9001952,R00CA175290,"['Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Biophysics', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exons', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTEN gene', 'Play', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'RNA', 'RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'career development', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experience', 'mRNA Expression', 'medical schools', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'professor', 'prostate carcinogenesis', 'protein complex', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R00,2016,201953,-0.02020390737025462
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,9091436,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon Alfa-2b', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Banking', 'Tissue Banks', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2016,2162000,0.04070031987065596
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9150339,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,547736,0.04752969870502473
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9067260,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2016,347700,0.012874170604600433
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.

"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field.

"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field.

"Identification, Characterization, and Prediction of Cancer Driver Mutations in Regulatory Regions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research training program is to provide me (Dr. Collin Melton) with additional training in areas that will accelerate my career development as I transition from a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Michael Snyder's lab to an independent tenure track professor. The key elements of this plan are: Candidate: I have extensive training in experimental and computational approaches to studying biomedicine. Areas of additional focus for career development during the K99 mentored post-doctoral research phase include the acquisition of additional experimental skills and supplemental training in cancer biology, human genetics, human genomics, applied statistics, and parallel computing. Additionally, I will receive training in laboratory management, mentorship, and responsible conduct of research. This well-rounded plan will provide me with a skill set that will enable a facile transition from postdoctoral fellow to tenure track faculty. Environment: I have a valuable advisory committee with experts in the areas of genomics, genetics, and cancer biology to ensure my success in this training program and to guide me through the successful acquisition of a faculty job. These include my mentor Dr. Michael Snyder, my co-mentor Dr. James Ford and two advisors, Dr. Hanlee Ji and Dr. Anshul Kundaje. The environment at Stanford University in the Snyder lab and department of Genetics fosters productivity and collaboration with word class facilities, resources, and researchers. Research: My proposed research plan in cancer genomics is timely, relevant, and innovative. The majority of current research in cancer genomics has made groundbreaking progress in understanding the relevant DNA variation that occurs in coding regions of the genome; however, 97-98% of the human genome does not code for protein. This proposal focuses specifically on studying the regulatory regions of the human genome to identify, characterize, and interpret the impact of point mutations in these regulatory regions. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that point mutations in regulatory regions of the human genome drive cancer formation and the functional consequences of these mutations can be predicted using machine learning algorithms. Aim 1 proposes the statistical identification of regulatory regions which are mutated across cancer samples, Aim 2 proposes functional characterization of the prevalent mutations identified in Aim 1, and Aim 3 extends the analysis of characterizing the effects of mutations genome-wide through use of genomics approaches and proposes the use of machine learning to classify novel mutations as either disrupting, activating, or having no effect on regulatory element activity. Through its use of experimental datasets combined with predictive models for functional consequences of individual cancer variation, this research will further the goal of personalized genome interpretation for cancer therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every cancer patient's disease is caused by unique set of abnormal variation in the human genome. Advancing our understanding this variation aids in the development of new treatments and the proper application of existing treatments. This proposal focuses on understanding a particular type of cancer variation that occurs in regulatory regions of the human genome.","Identification, Characterization, and Prediction of Cancer Driver Mutations in Regulatory Regions",8931936,K99CA191093,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hela Cells', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Occupations', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'career development', 'epigenomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'interest', 'migration', 'mutant', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'trend', 'tumor progression']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2015,116122,-0.0008707433785482868
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.                ",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9044512,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Family', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forging', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'model building', 'molecular imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,198952,0.00559642165118164
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA PROJECT SUMMARY Recent studies revealed that the human genome encodes thousands of lncRNAs with little proteincoding capacity. LncRNAs were shown to play important roles in cancer and are potentially a new class of therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the function of the vast majority of lncRNAs in cancer remains unknown. LncRNA function often depends on its physical interactions with protein complexes. They can also influence the abundance of other mRNAs that are targeted by the same microRNAs by competing for microRNA binding, i.e., serving as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Advances in genomic technologies, especially those based on next generation sequencing (NGS), provide unparalleled opportunities to characterize the functional networks of lncRNA in cancer. However, analysis and integration of different types of genomic datasets to generate testable hypotheses is challenging, and systematic approaches to characterize lncRNA function in cancer are lacking. This application describes the development of computational methods and integrative genomic strategies for systematically dissecting the functional network of lncRNA in cancer, and a combination of computational and experimental approaches to unravel several important functional networks of lncRNA in prostate cancer. Specifically, it will (1) develop a computational method for repurposing the publically available array-based data to interrogate lncRNA expression in tumor samples and utilize an integrative genomic strategy to predict lncRNAs that may be important for tumorigenesis/tumor suppression in prostate cancer via analysis of lncRNA expression profiles, clinical information and somatic genomic alteration profiles of tumor samples, (2) identify the lncRNAs that are associated with EZH2 or direct transcriptional targets of EZH2 repression that are important for prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression, and (3) identify the ceRNAs of AR and PTEN that mediate prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression. In addition to its scientific proposal, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in the fields of computational genomics, noncoding RNA and cancer, who develops cutting-edge computational methods, and uses a combination of computational and experimental approaches to understand structure-function relationship of noncoding RNA and the function of noncoding RNA and RNA-protein interaction in cancer. While the candidate of this application has received extensive training in biophysics, statistics, machine learning and computational genomics, this career development award will allow him to develop his experimental skills, especially those next-generation sequencing-based techniques and molecular biology experiments in human cell lines. Dr. Liu, Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Dr. Brown, Professor of Medicine will mentor the candidate in the excellent training environment of Dana Farber Cancer Institute, a part of Harvard Medical School community. A committee of experienced computational and cancer biologists will also advise him on both scientific research and career development. The proposed study is to decipher lncRNA function in cancer using a combination of novel computational methods and high-throughput experimental technologies. The proposed research will result in publically available bioinformatic resources for studying lncRNA function in cancer, a greater understanding of IncRNA function in prostate cancer, and will help to discover novel therapeutic target of lncRNA for treating prostate cancer.",An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA,8994367,R00CA175290,"['Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Biophysics', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Exons', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTEN gene', 'Play', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'RNA', 'RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'career development', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experience', 'human EZH2 protein', 'mRNA Expression', 'medical schools', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'professor', 'prostate carcinogenesis', 'protein complex', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R00,2015,249000,-0.02020390737025462
"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,8919260,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon Alfa-2b', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Banking', 'Tissue Banks', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2015,2185000,0.04070031987065596
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9037783,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,572285,0.04752969870502473
"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development. These studies have implications for generation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for colon cancer. n/a",Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci,8916038,U01CA151920,"['Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complementary DNA', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intestines', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Study', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'authority', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'candidate validation', 'clinical phenotype', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'forging', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'intestinal epithelium', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'segregation', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistics', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,538250,0.010620185219348398
"Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large tumor exome sequencing projects have identified a very large number of mutations whose cancer relevance is not yet understood. To begin to address this need, our team has produced two web applications for high-throughput computational analysis of cancer mutations: the Cancer-Related Analysis of VAriants Toolkit (CRAVAT) and the Mutation Position Imaging Toolbox (MuPIT). CRAVAT accepts millions of mutations in a single batch upload and maps mutations from genomic coordinates to annotated transcripts and proteins. MuPIT currently accepts batch uploads of up to 2500 SNVs and maps from genomic coordinates onto X-ray crystal structures of proteins from Protein Data Bank (PDB). We propose to combine and harden CRAVAT and MuPIT into a single web application, in which we will substantially improve the tools, user interface, software infrastructure, integration with external data resources and tools used by the community, and support for protected data. The scope of all tools in the web application will be broadened to handle analysis of the full range of small-scale mutation consequence types found in cancer exomes.  CRAVAT analysis identifies mutations most likely to have deleterious impact on protein function and those that are most likely to confer a selective advantage to cancer cells (drivers), using classifiers developed by our team. Classifier scores are supplemented with annotations, including population allele frequencies, previous occurrence in tumor tissue types, and gene functional categories, enabling filtering (e.g. removing polymorphisms) and prioritization. Gene-level annotation and scoring, by aggregation of classifier scores from mutations in a cohort is also provided.  MuPIT maps mutations from genomic positions onto to protein structures and provides interactive viewing of mutations in the context of protein structure, and in relation to a variety of annotations. To enable prioritization of interesting mutations and genes, the application provides a preview describing each structure and all available annotations (e.g., binding sites, experimental mutagenesis results, polymorphic and disease- associated variants that have been previously documented). After selecting a PDB of interest, the user is led to an interactive visualization page. An enhanced Jmol applet displays all SNVs mapped onto the structure. Frequently, many SNVs in the input list can be mapped onto a single structure, revealing clustering patterns around key functional sites.  Based only on word-of-mouth, since the debut of the two applications in August 2012, CRAVAT has been utilized by 129 unique users from 39 countries, and it has analyzed 1,136 submitted jobs, totaling 27.9 million mutations. MuPIT has been utilized by 242 unique users from 25 countries, with 720 submitted jobs. (Source: Google Analytics). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will harden and develop web applications for the cancer genomics community to interpret small-scale mutations in cancer exomes. They are designed to handle very large number of mutations and to provide analysis targeted at researchers who are not bioinformatics experts. The work will contribute to understanding of the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of tumors and assist in discovery of new approaches for cancer prognosis and treatments.",Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations,8910262,U01CA180956,"['Address', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Ensure', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Occupations', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer classification', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'data exchange', 'design', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel strategies', 'personalized diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'software development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web services']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,315948,0.02358293267302601
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,8876876,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2015,347700,0.012874170604600433
"Identification, Characterization, and Prediction of Cancer Driver Mutations in Regulatory Regions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research training program is to provide me (Dr. Collin Melton) with additional training in areas that will accelerate my career development as I transition from a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Michael Snyder's lab to an independent tenure track professor. The key elements of this plan are: Candidate: I have extensive training in experimental and computational approaches to studying biomedicine. Areas of additional focus for career development during the K99 mentored post-doctoral research phase include the acquisition of additional experimental skills and supplemental training in cancer biology, human genetics, human genomics, applied statistics, and parallel computing. Additionally, I will receive training in laboratory management, mentorship, and responsible conduct of research. This well-rounded plan will provide me with a skill set that will enable a facile transition from postdoctoral fellow to tenure track faculty. Environment: I have a valuable advisory committee with experts in the areas of genomics, genetics, and cancer biology to ensure my success in this training program and to guide me through the successful acquisition of a faculty job. These include my mentor Dr. Michael Snyder, my co-mentor Dr. James Ford and two advisors, Dr. Hanlee Ji and Dr. Anshul Kundaje. The environment at Stanford University in the Snyder lab and department of Genetics fosters productivity and collaboration with word class facilities, resources, and researchers. Research: My proposed research plan in cancer genomics is timely, relevant, and innovative. The majority of current research in cancer genomics has made groundbreaking progress in understanding the relevant DNA variation that occurs in coding regions of the genome; however, 97-98% of the human genome does not code for protein. This proposal focuses specifically on studying the regulatory regions of the human genome to identify, characterize, and interpret the impact of point mutations in these regulatory regions. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that point mutations in regulatory regions of the human genome drive cancer formation and the functional consequences of these mutations can be predicted using machine learning algorithms. Aim 1 proposes the statistical identification of regulatory regions which are mutated across cancer samples, Aim 2 proposes functional characterization of the prevalent mutations identified in Aim 1, and Aim 3 extends the analysis of characterizing the effects of mutations genome-wide through use of genomics approaches and proposes the use of machine learning to classify novel mutations as either disrupting, activating, or having no effect on regulatory element activity. Through its use of experimental datasets combined with predictive models for functional consequences of individual cancer variation, this research will further the goal of personalized genome interpretation for cancer therapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every cancer patient's disease is caused by unique set of abnormal variation in the human genome. Advancing our understanding this variation aids in the development of new treatments and the proper application of existing treatments. This proposal focuses on understanding a particular type of cancer variation that occurs in regulatory regions of the human genome.        The written critiques of individual reviewers are provided in essentially unedited form in this section.

Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.

"An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies revealed that the human genome encodes thousands of lncRNAs with little protein-coding capacity. LncRNAs were shown to play important roles in cancer and are potentially a new class of therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the function of the vast majority of lncRNAs in cancer remains unknown. LncRNA function often depends on its physical interactions with protein complexes. They can also influence the abundance of other mRNAs that are targeted by the same microRNAs by competing for microRNA binding, i.e., serving as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Advances in genomic technologies, especially those based on next generation sequencing (NGS), provide unparalleled opportunities to characterize the functional networks of lncRNA in cancer. However, analysis and integration of different types of genomic datasets to generate testable hypotheses is challenging, and systematic approaches to characterize lncRNA function in cancer are lacking. This application describes the development of computational methods and integrative genomic strategies for systematically dissecting the functional network of lncRNA in cancer, and a combination of computational and experimental approaches to unravel several important functional networks of lncRNA in prostate cancer. Specifically, it will (1) develop a computational method for repurposing the publically available array-based data to interrogate lncRNA expression in tumor samples and utilize an integrative genomic strategy to predict lncRNAs that may be important for tumorigenesis/tumor suppression in prostate cancer via analysis of lncRNA expression profiles, clinical information and somatic genomic alteration profiles of tumor samples, (2) identify the lncRNAs that are associated with EZH2 or direct transcriptional targets of EZH2 repression that are important for prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression, and (3) identify the ceRNAs of AR and PTEN that mediate prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression. In addition to its scientific proposal, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in the fields of computational genomics, non-coding RNA and cancer, who develops cutting-edge computational methods, and uses a combination of computational and experimental approaches to understand structure- function relationship of non-coding RNA and the function of non-coding RNA and RNA-protein interaction in cancer.

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,8735848,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Banking', 'Tissue Banks', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2014,2161838,0.04070031987065596
"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development. These studies have implications for generation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for colon cancer.           n/a",Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci,8727268,U01CA151920,"['Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complementary DNA', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intestines', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Study', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'authority', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'candidate validation', 'clinical phenotype', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'forging', 'gene discovery', 'intestinal epithelium', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'segregation', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistics', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,523201,0.010620185219348398
"Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large tumor exome sequencing projects have identified a very large number of mutations whose cancer relevance is not yet understood. To begin to address this need, our team has produced two web applications for high-throughput computational analysis of cancer mutations: the Cancer-Related Analysis of VAriants Toolkit (CRAVAT) and the Mutation Position Imaging Toolbox (MuPIT). CRAVAT accepts millions of mutations in a single batch upload and maps mutations from genomic coordinates to annotated transcripts and proteins. MuPIT currently accepts batch uploads of up to 2500 SNVs and maps from genomic coordinates onto X-ray crystal structures of proteins from Protein Data Bank (PDB). We propose to combine and harden CRAVAT and MuPIT into a single web application, in which we will substantially improve the tools, user interface, software infrastructure, integration with external data resources and tools used by the community, and support for protected data. The scope of all tools in the web application will be broadened to handle analysis of the full range of small-scale mutation consequence types found in cancer exomes.  CRAVAT analysis identifies mutations most likely to have deleterious impact on protein function and those that are most likely to confer a selective advantage to cancer cells (drivers), using classifiers developed by our team. Classifier scores are supplemented with annotations, including population allele frequencies, previous occurrence in tumor tissue types, and gene functional categories, enabling filtering (e.g. removing polymorphisms) and prioritization. Gene-level annotation and scoring, by aggregation of classifier scores from mutations in a cohort is also provided.  MuPIT maps mutations from genomic positions onto to protein structures and provides interactive viewing of mutations in the context of protein structure, and in relation to a variety of annotations. To enable prioritization of interesting mutations and genes, the application provides a preview describing each structure and all available annotations (e.g., binding sites, experimental mutagenesis results, polymorphic and disease- associated variants that have been previously documented). After selecting a PDB of interest, the user is led to an interactive visualization page. An enhanced Jmol applet displays all SNVs mapped onto the structure. Frequently, many SNVs in the input list can be mapped onto a single structure, revealing clustering patterns around key functional sites.  Based only on word-of-mouth, since the debut of the two applications in August 2012, CRAVAT has been utilized by 129 unique users from 39 countries, and it has analyzed 1,136 submitted jobs, totaling 27.9 million mutations. MuPIT has been utilized by 242 unique users from 25 countries, with 720 submitted jobs. (Source: Google Analytics).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will harden and develop web applications for the cancer genomics community to interpret small-scale mutations in cancer exomes. They are designed to handle very large number of mutations and to provide analysis targeted at researchers who are not bioinformatics experts. The work will contribute to understanding of the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of tumors and assist in discovery of new approaches for cancer prognosis and treatments.

"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,8548580,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Banking', 'Tissue Banks', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2013,2150500,0.04070031987065596
"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development. These studies have implications for generation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for colon cancer.           n/a",Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci,8534039,U01CA151920,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complementary DNA', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intestines', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Study', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'authority', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'candidate validation', 'clinical phenotype', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'design', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'forging', 'gene discovery', 'intestinal epithelium', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'segregation', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistics', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2013,507962,0.010620185219348398
"Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations  PROJECT SUMMARY  Large tumor exome sequencing projects have identified a very large number of mutations whose cancer relevance is not yet understood. To begin to address this need, our team has produced two web applications for high-throughput computational analysis of cancer mutations: the Cancer-Related Analysis of VAriants Toolkit (CRAVAT) and the Mutation Position Imaging Toolbox (MuPIT). CRAVAT accepts millions of mutations in a single batch upload and maps mutations from genomic coordinates to annotated transcripts and proteins. MuPIT currently accepts batch uploads of up to 2500 SNVs and maps from genomic coordinates onto X-ray crystal structures of proteins from Protein Data Bank (PDB). We propose to combine and harden CRAVAT and MuPIT into a single web application, in which we will substantially improve the tools, user interface, software infrastructure, integration with external data resources and tools used by the community, and support for protected data. The scope of all tools in the web application will be broadened to handle analysis of the full range of small-scale mutation consequence types found in cancer exomes.  CRAVAT analysis identifies mutations most likely to have deleterious impact on protein function and those that are most likely to confer a selective advantage to cancer cells (drivers), using classifiers developed by our team. Classifier scores are supplemented with annotations, including population allele frequencies, previous occurrence in tumor tissue types, and gene functional categories, enabling filtering (e.g. removing polymorphisms) and prioritization. Gene-level annotation and scoring, by aggregation of classifier scores from mutations in a cohort is also provided.  MuPIT maps mutations from genomic positions onto to protein structures and provides interactive viewing of mutations in the context of protein structure, and in relation to a variety of annotations. To enable prioritization of interesting mutations and genes, the application provides a preview describing each structure and all available annotations (e.g., binding sites, experimental mutagenesis results, polymorphic and disease- associated variants that have been previously documented). After selecting a PDB of interest, the user is led to an interactive visualization page. An enhanced Jmol applet displays all SNVs mapped onto the structure. Frequently, many SNVs in the input list can be mapped onto a single structure, revealing clustering patterns around key functional sites.  Based only on word-of-mouth, since the debut of the two applications in August 2012, CRAVAT has been utilized by 129 unique users from 39 countries, and it has analyzed 1,136 submitted jobs, totaling 27.9 million mutations. MuPIT has been utilized by 242 unique users from 25 countries, with 720 submitted jobs. (Source: Google Analytics). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will harden and develop web applications for the cancer genomics community to interpret small-scale mutations in cancer exomes. They are designed to handle very large number of mutations and to provide analysis targeted at researchers who are not bioinformatics experts. The work will contribute to understanding of the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of tumors and assist in discovery of new approaches for cancer prognosis and treatments.            ",Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations,8606625,U01CA180956,"['Address', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Ensure', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Occupations', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer classification', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'cohort', 'data exchange', 'design', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial alkaline proteinase inhibitor', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web services']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2013,289971,0.02350434456726275
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8473174,R01CA135509,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Angiogenesis Promoter', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Facies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'VHL mutation', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'angiogenesis', 'bHLH-PAS factor HLF', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer therapy', 'caspase-3', 'cell behavior', 'human FRAP1 protein', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'intercellular communication', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,421339,0.05050184882820452
"Algorithmic strategies for detecting structural variation in genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fine-scale nucleotide changes, along with genetic recombination, are often cited as the major source of human genetic variation [1, 13, 14]. Less is known about larger scale (> 10kb) genomic structural variations. As genomic technologies improve, we are detecting structural variation in ever-increasing numbers, including genomic inversions [24, 48, 71, 65, 31]; insertion/deletion polymorphisms [12, 26, 42]; and, copy number polymorphisms [28, 59, 60]. These large variations can completely disrupt coding and regulatory sites and copy number of genes, and thereby have a huge impact on human phenotypes and disease susceptibility [23, 61]. Deleterious effects have indeed been observed in cancer and other diseases [70, 43]. Our understanding of the scale and impact of these variations can be enhanced by improving computational tools for mining the data from these technologies. Here, I propose the development of algorithms and computational tools to improve detection and resolution (location of breakpoints) of structural variation. Specifically, I will develop algorithms for (a) experimental design of sequencing projects for detecting and resolving structural variations; (b) fine-mapping of breakpoints using end sequence profiling, to detect gene-disruption and gene-fusions; (c) reconstructing tumor genome architectures; (d) detection of targeted genomic variations in a heterogeneous mix of normal versus mutated cells via multiplex PCR; and (e) detection of balanced structural variation in genotype data. The tools will be designed using techniques from statistical machine learning and combinatorial algorithms. Validation will be performed using known structural variations, simulation studies, and extensive experimental collaborations with technology developers and early technology adopters. All of the data, and software will be freely available for academic and non-commercial uses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed computational tools will be used to detect structural variations in human populations as a starting point for understanding their role in normal evolution and disease, specifically cancer. The architecture of tumor genomes will help reveal genes that are disrupted and differentially expressed in tumor cells. The targeted detection of genomic lesions in a heterogeneous mix of mutated and wildtype cells, will find application as an early diagnostic for cancer. Thus, our computational methods will have an immediate and long term effect on human health.           Project Narrative The proposed computational tools will be used to detect structural variations in human populations as a starting point for understanding their role in normal evolution and disease, specifically cancer.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics.

"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development.

"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research.

"Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors  7. Project Summary/Abstract  Salivary gland tumors constitute 1-6% of head and neck tumors numbering 3600 new cases per year in the US. Though rare, there are 37 histopathological malignant subtypes and 13 benign subtypes of salivary gland tumors, making it one of the most challenging tumors to diagnose. While surgery is the main modality of treatment, advance unresectable primary, recurrent and metastatic tumors are generally fatal. The rarity of the tumors and multiple histopathological subtypes generated major clinical challenges for the early detection, diagnosis, therapeutic interventions and prognosis of patients with salivary gland tumors.  This application addresses the missing gaps in salivary gland tumor research by advancing the basic and translational sciences. Our approach is to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of salivary gland tumors using the most advanced omics technologies coupled with advanced data and bioinformatics analysis to develop tissue-based biomarkers for salivary gland malignancy detection as well as the potential use of salivary biomarkers to screen/risk assess symptomatic patients for salivary gland malignancies. In additional a systems network analysis approach (Weighted-Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis, WGCNA) will be use to examine the derived omics databases to identify pivotal molecular pathways and gene targets for salivary gland malignancy development. Collective these approaches will lead to translational and mechanistic insights for salivary tumor development that can be further translated for clinical applications as well as mechanistic evaluations using rodent models for salivary gland carcinogenesis.  Six Specific Aims are in place to test the hypothesis in this application. Aim 1 is to procure fresh frozen malignant and benign parotid gland tissues from the UCLA Head & Neck Oncology Clinic. Aim 2 is to perform comprehensive profiling of parotid gland tumors' transcriptome; microRNA and epigenome using most advanced RNA sequencing and methylomics arrays. Aim 3 will perform statistical and bioinformatics analysis for the omics databases to select candidate biomarkers that can detect parotid gland malignancies. These candidate biomarkers will be pre-validated in Aim 4 in an independent cohort of parotid gland malignant and benign tumors. Aim 5 is to explore the hypothesis that tissue-based dysregulated biomarkers in malignant parotid glands are concordantly dysregulated in saliva of these patients. Finally Aim 6 is a systems network based analysis of the omics databases to identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are pivotal in the development of parotid gland malignancies. These pathway and targets outcome can be evaluated in future mechanistic studies in salivary gland malignancy development by rodent models or cell lines.  Our multidisciplinary research team has the expertise and track record to carry out the proposed molecular characterization of parotid gland tumors as well as expertise to carryout the mechanistic and translational next steps to fully materialize the goals of this RFA.  8. Relevance to Public Health Statement  Salivary gland tumors are rare. However, they are aggressive and fatal. Due to its rarity (1-6% of head and neck cancers) and the fact that there are 24 variants of salivary gland cancers and 13 variants of benign subtypes, clinical diagnosis of salivary gland tumor is one of the worst, hampering treatment decisions and prognostics outcomes of patients. This application takes the novel and impactful approach to generate the most comprehensive molecular profile of salivary gland tumors to develop molecular signatures of salivary gland malignancies, saliva based biomarkers for early detection of salivary gland cancers and informatics outcomes that will identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are involved in the mechanistic development of salivary gland malignancies. The outcomes of this application are molecular signatures of parotid gland cancer to assist clinical diagnosis; salivary biomarkers to assist early detection of salivary gland cancers and identified biological pathways and gene targets for mechanistic evaluation in rodent models for salivary gland tumor carcinogenesis.",Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors,8534892,R56DE023241,"['Abbreviations', 'Acinar Cell Carcinoma', 'Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma', 'Adenolymphoma', 'Basic Science', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of salivary gland', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Parotid Cancer', 'Parotid Gland', 'Parotid Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent Model', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms', 'Salivary Glands', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'abstracting', 'adenoma', 'antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'insight', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R56,2012,211387,0.02826532313892279
"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8271303,R01CA135509,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Angiogenesis Promoter', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Facies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'VHL mutation', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'angiogenesis', 'bHLH-PAS factor HLF', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer therapy', 'caspase-3', 'cell behavior', 'human FRAP1 protein', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'intercellular communication', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,447222,0.05050184882820452
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data.

"Algorithmic strategies for detecting structural variation in genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fine-scale nucleotide changes, along with genetic recombination, are often cited as the major source of human genetic variation [1, 13, 14]. Less is known about larger scale (> 10kb) genomic structural variations. As genomic technologies improve, we are detecting structural variation in ever-increasing numbers, including genomic inversions [24, 48, 71, 65, 31]; insertion/deletion polymorphisms [12, 26, 42]; and, copy number polymorphisms [28, 59, 60]. These large variations can completely disrupt coding and regulatory sites and copy number of genes, and thereby have a huge impact on human phenotypes and disease susceptibility [23, 61]. Deleterious effects have indeed been observed in cancer and other diseases [70, 43]. Our understanding of the scale and impact of these variations can be enhanced by improving computational tools for mining the data from these technologies. Here, I propose the development of algorithms and computational tools to improve detection and resolution (location of breakpoints) of structural variation.

"Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer program is focused on two skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and melanoma. The goals are to conduct epidemiologic and genetic studies on early onset basal cell carcinoma (Project 1), establish novel high-throughput prognostic and diagnostic tools for melanomas (Projects 2 and 4), and introduce novel targeted therapies to treat melanoma (Projects 2 and 3). The new approaches include genome-wide monitoring of melanoma tumor responses to epigenetic modifiers (Project 2); the use of high-density protein microarrays (ProtoArrays) to interrogate serological responses in sera from melanoma patients (Project 4); and novel epigenetic modifier and immune modulation therapy for melanoma (Projects 2 and 3, respectively). The SPORE includes Administration, Specimen Resource and Bioinformatics/Biostatistics Cores to support the studies of SPORE investigators. Developmental Research and Career Development Award Programs are proposed. The Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer will be an integral part of the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center (YCCC), Yale New Haven Hospital, and the Dermatology, Pathology and Epidemiology/Public Health Departments that collectively will provide the patient populations, specimens and other resources and support systems needed for the SPORE activities. There is a full commitment from the Dean of Yale School of Medicine and the Director of the YCCC/Chairman of Dermatology to support the SPORE with a plan for cost sharing. The major Translational Results expected are: a) Guidelines for preventive interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of early and total BCC that will diminish the management costs of the most common skin cancer; b) The introduction of new molecular tools for assessing responses to novel epigenetic modifiers; c) The introduction of new ways of assessing melanoma patients employing serological markers; d) The application of new approaches to personalize melanoma chemo- and immunotherapy; e) The establishment of a composite databases for skin cancers that includes specimens tracking, clinical information, high throughput proteomics and genomics. The database program will be compatible with caBIG and will be available on the web for the benefit of the wider community of investigators and clinicians; f) The creation of new translational bioinformatics tools (predictive statistics and artificial intelligence) required to analyze global and highly complex information derived from different sources and different platforms. n/a",Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer,8325739,P50CA121974,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Chairperson', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Cost Sharing', 'Databases', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Internet', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protein Microchips', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Support System', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'chemotherapy', 'cost', 'density', 'early onset', 'genome-wide', 'immunoregulation', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'serological marker', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,P50,2011,500000,0.03370932367084607
"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development. These studies have implications for generation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for colon cancer.           n/a",Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci,8178935,U01CA151920,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complementary DNA', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intestines', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Study', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'authority', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'candidate validation', 'clinical phenotype', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'design', 'exome', 'experience', 'forging', 'gene discovery', 'intestinal epithelium', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'segregation', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistics', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2011,537462,0.010620185219348398
"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              n/a",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Algorithmic strategies for detecting structural variation in genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fine-scale nucleotide changes, along with genetic recombination, are often cited as the major source of human genetic variation [1, 13, 14]. Less is known about larger scale (> 10kb) genomic structural variations. As genomic technologies improve, we are detecting structural variation in ever-increasing numbers, including genomic inversions [24, 48, 71, 65, 31]; insertion/deletion polymorphisms [12, 26, 42]; and, copy number polymorphisms [28, 59, 60]. These large variations can completely disrupt coding and regulatory sites and copy number of genes, and thereby have a huge impact on human phenotypes and disease susceptibility [23, 61]. Deleterious effects have indeed been observed in cancer and other diseases [70, 43]. Our understanding of the scale and impact of these variations can be enhanced by improving computational tools for mining the data from these technologies. Here, I propose the development of algorithms and computational tools to improve detection and resolution (location of breakpoints) of structural variation. Specifically, I will develop algorithms for (a) experimental design of sequencing projects for detecting and resolving structural variations; (b) fine-mapping of breakpoints using end sequence profiling, to detect gene-disruption and gene-fusions; (c) reconstructing tumor genome architectures; (d) detection of targeted genomic variations in a heterogeneous mix of normal versus mutated cells via multiplex PCR; and (e) detection of balanced structural variation in genotype data. The tools will be designed using techniques from statistical machine learning and combinatorial algorithms. Validation will be performed using known structural variations, simulation studies, and extensive experimental collaborations with technology developers and early technology adopters. All of the data, and software will be freely available for academic and non-commercial uses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed computational tools will be used to detect structural variations in human populations as a starting point for understanding their role in normal evolution and disease, specifically cancer. The architecture of tumor genomes will help reveal genes that are disrupted and differentially expressed in tumor cells. The targeted detection of genomic lesions in a heterogeneous mix of mutated and wildtype cells, will find application as an early diagnostic for cancer. Thus, our computational methods will have an immediate and long term effect on human health.           Project Narrative The proposed computational tools will be used to detect structural variations in human populations as a starting point for understanding their role in normal evolution and disease, specifically cancer.

"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care.

The goals are to conduct epidemiologic and genetic studies on early onset basal cell carcinoma (Project 1), establish novel high-throughput prognostic and diagnostic tools for melanomas (Projects 2 and 4), and introduce novel targeted therapies to treat melanoma (Projects 2 and 3). The new approaches include genome-wide monitoring of melanoma tumor responses to epigenetic modifiers (Project 2); the use of high-density protein microarrays (ProtoArrays) to interrogate serological responses in sera from melanoma patients (Project 4); and novel epigenetic modifier and immune modulation therapy for melanoma (Projects 2 and 3, respectively). The SPORE includes Administration, Specimen Resource and Bioinformatics/Biostatistics Cores to support the studies of SPORE investigators. Developmental Research and Career Development Award Programs are proposed. The Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer will be an integral part of the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center (YCCC), Yale New Haven Hospital, and the Dermatology, Pathology and Epidemiology/Public Health Departments that collectively will provide the patient populations, specimens and other resources and support systems needed for the SPORE activities. There is a full commitment from the Dean of Yale School of Medicine and the Director of the YCCC/Chairman of Dermatology to support the SPORE with a plan for cost sharing. The major Translational Results expected are: a) Guidelines for preventive interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of early and total BCC that will diminish the management costs of the most common skin cancer; b) The introduction of new molecular tools for assessing responses to novel epigenetic modifiers; c) The introduction of new ways of assessing melanoma patients employing serological markers; d) The application of new approaches to personalize melanoma chemo- and immuno- therapy; e) The establishment of a composite databases for skin cancers that includes specimens tracking, clinical information, high throughput proteomics and genomics.

"EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS NEOPLASIA    DESCRIPTION  (Applicant's  Description):    The  cell  lineages  in neoplastic       tissues are evolving under the twin dynamics of mutation and clonal expansion.       This  is the basis for both its virulence and our difficulties in treating it.       We  hypothesize  that a subset of the mutations observed in the progression to       cancer  confer  beneficial  selective  effects  on  the cell.

The aim of       this  project  is  to  identify  these  selective  mutations  and to infer the       interactions  between the mutant clones in Barrett's Esophagus that eventually       lead  to  the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

"Validating and Translating Array Signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   In the area of cancer, microarray analysis is being used to identify specific differences between normal and disease tissues. Such efforts are leading to the identification of small gene sets, or signatures, that can provide key information for classifying cancer types. We propose here a mechanism for translating these discoveries into cost-effective, quantitative assays based on the use of highly multiplexed, universal-primer-driven rtPCR (UP-rtPCR). In this proposal we will demonstrate and validate the combined use of artificial neural network analysis for identification of small gene signatures and UP-rtPCR technology for translating these signatures into high throughput assays for use in research and clinical settings. Success will be measured by the ability of this approach to differentiate 4 types of small, round, blue-cell tumors. This work will be performed in collaboration with Drs. Javed Khan and Gary Fogel.            n/a",Validating and Translating Array Signatures,6836381,R43CA110542,"['RNA', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'gene expression', 'high throughput technology', 'human genetic material tag', 'microarray technology', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'technology /technique development']",NCI,"ALTHEA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2004,99999,0.0008837711860296783
"Aptamer Development for Cancer Diagnosis and Management DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early diagnosis of disease allows for more effective therapy and better clinical outcomes.  In cancer, extensive effort has gone toward development of screening and diagnostic techniques for early detection of disease. Despite this effort, the probability of single-analyte assays providing the ""silver bullet"" to address these problems for any specific tumor is vanishingly small. A more comprehensive approach that is more likely to succeed is the development of an integrated molecular diagnostic system using multiplexed assays of cancer-related biomarkers coupled with data analysis using bioinformatics-based algorithms. The development of multiplexed assays to improve quality of patient life is a major goal of SomaLogic. SomaLogic's proprietary nucleic-acid based capture agents, photoaptamers, yield quantitative analysis of proteins found in complex biological samples. Using data generated with this assay platform, we expect to develop predictive biomedical algorithms for the diagnosis and management of a variety of diseases, including cancer.   The specific objective of this Phase I proposal is to develop an initial set of photoaptamers targeted to proteins and/or protein complexes that have been associated with a wide variety of solid tumors, i.e., proteinases, proteinase inhibitors, and proteinase-inhibitor complexes, which can then be used to screen clinical samples from patients with a variety of solid tumor types and stages of disease. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop a set of well-defined photoaptamers specific for 20 proteinases, antiproteinases and proteinase-antiproteinase complexes that are believed to be associated with invasion and metastasis of solid tumors; 2) develop a photoaptamer microarray assay (""proteomics chip"") for the measurement of at least 20 cognate proteins or protein complexes in serum or plasma; and 3) evaluate the ranges for these proteins or protein complexes in serum and plasma obtained from normal subjects.   The overall objective of our research efforts in cancer is to develop CLIA-compatible assays and algorithm-based analysis systems for the monitoring of patients at risk for or diagnosed with various malignancies using aptamers directed against proteins that are either generally associated (proteinases, antiproteinases, adhesion molecules chemokines and/or chemokine receptors) or specifically associated (known cell markers, tissue specific proteins, transcriptional regulators, etc.) with solid tumors. n/a",Aptamer Development for Cancer Diagnosis and Management,6785751,R43CA108005,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'biomarker', 'chemical binding', 'chemical synthesis', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'early diagnosis', 'endopeptidases', 'enzyme complex', 'enzyme inhibitors', 'mathematics', 'microarray technology', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'oligonucleotides', 'proteomics', 'technology /technique development']",NCI,"SOMALOGIC, INC.",R43,2004,99853,-6.807385451187185e-05

The  order  of  genetic  events  in the progression to       esophageal adenocarcinoma will be determined by phylogenetic reconstruction of       the  cell lineages in the neoplastic tissue of each patient.  Machine learning       techniques,  such  as the EM algorithm, will be employed to infer missing data       and the effects of unsampled mutations. Computational modeling will be used to       generate   comparison  data  for  null  hypotheses  as  well  as  to  generate       experimental  predictions from our understanding of the progression to cancer.       This  is  the first step in my long-term career goal to contribute to medicine       through the use of computational and theoretical methods.  Working at the Fred       Hutchinson  Cancer  Research  Center  will  facilitate  the transition from my       background  in  computer  science  and  evolutionary theory, to an independent       research  program  based on the analysis of cellular and molecular dynamics of       cancer.  The challenge of this project is the integration of diverse molecular       and  epidemiological  data  into  a coherent and detailed understanding of the       progression to cancer in the neoplasm of a model system.                                                                                                                                                                                                       n/a",EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS NEOPLASIA,6229855,K01CA089267,"['Barretts esophagus', ' adenocarcinoma', ' cell cell interaction', ' clinical research', ' gene expression', ' gene mutation', ' human subject', ' loss of heterozygosity', ' mathematical model', ' microarray technology', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplastic growth', ' neoplastic process', ' telomere']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,K01,2001,118630,0.021975377762113623
"Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells Project Summary/Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and 3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients. Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen- independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task, we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones, based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies. Project Narrative Identification of tumor-specific T cells is critical to immunotherapy development, yet remains a challenging task. In this project we will develop a novel machine learning method to study: 1) which T cells in the tumor microenvironment are reactive to malignant cells; 2) what signature genes can be used to track the cancer- specific T cells. Outcomes from this project are expected to improve the efficacy and precision of cancer immunotherapies.",Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells,10051274,R01CA245318,"['Adopted', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Autologous', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD28 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cellular immunotherapy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Expression Profiling', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HLA-A gene', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Human', 'IL2RA gene', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunodeficient Mouse', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Melanoma Cell', 'Methods', 'Oncogenes', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor stage', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer treatment', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical application', 'complementarity-determining region 3', 'deep learning', 'design', 'gag Gene Products', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive marker', 'receptor', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'side effect', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'software development', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,374006,0.022097202636451433
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies. We propose to integrate computational modeling with functional genomics techniques to refine the immunotherapy response biomarkers, identify novel regulators of immunotherapy response, and elucidate their underlying mechanisms, with the potential to improve immunotherapy response.",Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response,9930060,R01CA234018,"['4T1', 'ATAC-seq', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'CT26', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cell-Mediated Cytolysis', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Exclusion', 'Expression Profiling', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Knock-out', 'Libraries', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Regulator Genes', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Statistical Models', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'anti-CTLA4', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'genomic profiles', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune checkpoint blockers', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'web server']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2020,591752,0.05051973914678464
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9841402,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiscale data', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,188952,0.00559642165118164
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9997854,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'driver mutation', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2020,250795,0.04808574631373678
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer. This mission will be realized through analysis, integration and visualization of multi-omic datasets including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data collected from patient samples to develop predictive models, and during drug treatment of patient derived xenografts and cell lines to validate mechanisms.",Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation,9998919,U24CA210972,"['Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Signal Pathway', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'assay development', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'candidate marker', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data exploration', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data types', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'protein metabolite', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U24,2020,619256,0.04102029763828666
"SimBioSys PhenoScope: A Cloud-Enabled, Web-Based Portal for Raw and Processed Cancer Phenotype Data Spanning Scales from Genomes to Tissues While genomic methods yield a plethora of information on the underlying cause and variety of cancers, genotype is only one factor contributing to the observed phenotype of a tumor. Heterogeneity among cancers and differences within individual tumors continue to challenge the efforts to develop effective therapies. A multitude of data such as single cell sequencing, digital pathology, and medical imaging are being generated that captures heterogeneity across multiple scales. However, data is siloed and connections between scales remains elusive. We propose the development of SimBioSys PhenoScope, a novel research tool to harmonize these disparate data types and provide connections between the genomic, cellular/pathway, microscopic tissue environment, and tissue scales. Combining state-of-the art machine learning, dimensionality reduction techniques, novel spatio-temporal simulation algorithms, and support for public data repositories, PhenoScope will provide a new means of assessing factors contributing to a cancer's phenotypical behavior. As an exploratory data platform, the tool will provide novel multi-scale visualizations by relying on the novel analyses between scales, that could be used by academic and pharmaceutical researchers alike to generate hypotheses for new drug targets, dosing regimens, and research targets.

"Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center) SUMMARY-ABSTRACT  The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre- malignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre- melanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to myeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as shaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the Center for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary technical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision prevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the molecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk individuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials. This will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex tissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.  Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination with HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with three subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists and a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological specimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository will provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in prospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an oncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high- plex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate reagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications. Aim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to manage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most technically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each in preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm development.

"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,10001323,U24CA210990,"['Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North Carolina', 'Oncogenic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Subtype', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'data pipeline', 'exceptional responders', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2020,442117,0.07642225475218806
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,10000066,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,541899,0.07896774037790455
"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,9897497,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,340630,0.063447117103408
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong.

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.

"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,9831048,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,326848,0.01665744587225797
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10102369,R00CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R00,2020,249000,0.041515293249729884
"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets. These data can also be applied to other types of immunotherapy as we will also test. Cancer is a disease of the aged, but therapies are generally modeled in the young. We study age effects on cancer immunotherapy in response to PQ2 to develop ways to optimize cancer immunotherapy in aged patients most at risk. We focus on the PD-L1/PD-1 axis that is the cornerstone of the most successful cancer immunotherapies to date.",(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy,10000083,R01CA231325,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Appearance', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Genes', 'Genetically Modified Animals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aged', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-L1', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell dimension', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'early phase clinical trial', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune function', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'nano-string', 'neoplasm immunotherapy', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'preclinical study', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'ultra high resolution']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2020,623486,0.03274245025256791
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects.

"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,9902467,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'stem cells', 'tissue stem cells', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2020,324350,0.014661952181483034
"Comprehensive Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy Response Project Summary  Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs) immunotherapies can result in robust and durable disease control in many advanced malignancies, and their use is transforming cancer care. Despite the growing adoption, however, ICIs are effective in <30% of patients and can cause significant immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in up to ~60% of treated patients. Early determination of which patient will respond and/or develop irAEs remains a great challenge due to the complex interplay of tumor response, toxicity in critical organs, and overall patterns of immune activation. Further complicating their use, ICI costs are high ($100k-$250k annually/patient; total Medicare Part B payment for ICIs in 2018 >$4 billion). A comprehensive assessment of early ICI therapeutic response and toxicity would provide oncologists with timely, actionable information to better balance benefits and risks, improve patient outcomes, reduce toxicities and lower healthcare costs.  Molecular imaging is an invaluable tool for assessing spatial and temporal changes in tumors, damage to critical organs and immune activation during immunotherapies. Unfortunately, current assessments require manually evaluating a subset of disease sites, which is both laborious and subjective. Immunotherapies’ unique mechanism of action often gives rise to novel imaging patterns of tumor response (e.g. pseudoprogression) that cannot be easily resolved by current methods. Disease response, organ toxicity, and lymphoid tissue immune activation are interdependent. Information on all three of these aspects of response must be known to capture the complete landscape of immunotherapy response. The status quo in assessing response not only fails to fully extract clinically significant information from the imaging data, but also provides very limited information to medical oncologists for improved overall patient management. To address this unmet need, AIQ Solutions (Madison, WI) proposes to develop ImmunIQ , a software product that provides a comprehensive view of immunotherapy response. Specifically, ImmunIQ will automatically and simultaneously assess: (1) response of all tumor lesions, (2) immune-related toxicities in critical organs, and (3) immune activation. Upon successful completion of Phase I, we will have a functional software prototype. In Phase II, we will clinically validate the platform with outcome and irAE data and develop a prototype ready for commercialization and FDA 510(k) submission. Project Narrative Immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies have been transforming the treatment strategies in many advanced malignancies, however despite the growing adoption, it suffers from significant challenges, including low response rate, high incidence of immune-related adverse events, and high treatment costs.

"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels, with the ultimate goal of informing the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.",The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC,9980798,U54CA209975,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Property', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapeutics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'design', 'droplet sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'graduate student', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunotherapy trials', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lectures', 'live cell imaging', 'machine learning method', 'melanoma', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outreach program', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis', 'undergraduate student']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U54,2020,2312460,0.08119565495593987
"A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE While coding cancer driver mutations have been characterized in detail over the past decade, the contribution of noncoding mutations to tumor formation remains - apart from few examples (e.g. mutations in TERT promoters) - largely unknown. Recently, large-scale whole-genome sequencing datasets have been made available, but a major bottleneck for the biological and clinical interpretation of these cancer whole-genome cohorts is the lack of statistical models that identify driver mutations in noncoding regions.

"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",9964674,U54CA209988,"['3-Dimensional', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational Materials', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MDA-MB-468', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Resistance', 'SDZ RAD', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'analytical tool', 'bioimaging', 'bioprinting', 'cancer cell', 'combinatorial', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data management', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2020,2053370,0.038767436404368735
"Deciphering Clonal Evolution in Hereditary Renal Cell Carcinomas 1 Background: An improved understanding of the factors that drive cancer growth and progression is  2 fundamental for improving outcomes in patients with cancer. Individuals with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)  3 disease develop multiple vascular tumours in their lifetime including many hundreds of malignant  4 cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCCs). These tumours are the genomic mirror image of  5 sporadic ccRCCs and display variable clinical phenotypes. Profiling multiple, independent tumours  6 that have arisen in an identical germline and host environment offers an intrinsically controlled model  7 to study the factors underlying cancer evolution and progression in general. We will leverage the  8 unique clinical cohort of patients with VHL Disease at the Clinical Centre to study how the molecular  9 landscape (Objective 1), the tumour microenvironment (TME) (Objective 2) and the metabolome 10 (Objective 3) promote or restrain cancer growth. 11 Methods: Subjects will be recruited to this prospective cohort study from the Urology Oncology 12 Branch at the National Cancer Institute. Growth kinetics of individual tumours will be tracked 13 radiologically. During procurement, tumours are identified and correlated with imaging. We will 14 perform multiparametric molecular profiling, integrating all datasets to achieve our study objectives. 15 Using next generation sequencing we will characterise the events that underlie malignant 16 transformation (Objective 1.1) and the molecular events associated with differential growth kinetics 17 (Objective 1.1). We will explore events associated with tumour fromation in extra-renal sites 18 (Objective 1.3) and how molecular/environmental variants influence variable phenotypic penetration 19 amongst VHL kindred (Objective 1.4). To assess the role of the TME, we will use genomic profiling to 20 assess the neoantigen landscape (Objective 2.1) and identify differential immune cell lineages using 21 RNA sequencing (Objective 2.2). We will validate these fidnings with multiplex immunohistochemistry 22 (IHC) approach. We will assess the perturbed metabolome utilising transcriptome profiling (Objective 23 3.1) and conduct a pilot study to assess genomic and transcriptomic changes with stable isotope- 24 resolved metabolic profiles obtained from VHL tumor tissue obtained intraoperatively. 25 Conclusion: This will be the most comprehensive molecular profiling of cancers arising in VHL 26 disease. It has the potential to address key questions regarding evolutionary cancer biology and to 27 identify the triggers for tumour growth and progression and hence predictive or prognostic biomarkers 28 which may have a wider relevance to cancer. It may inform novel therapeutic strategies for the 29 treatment and prevention of hereditary and sporadic ccRCC. This translational prospective cohort study of patients with multiple tumours arising on a background of germline VHL mutation aims to comprehensively characterise and understand the molecular events associated with growth and progression of clear cell renal cancer and other VHL associated cancers. We will employ multiparametric tumour profiling to assess how the molecular landscape, the tumour microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming contribute to differences in tumour behaviour. Outputs from this research have the potential to address key question in evolutionary cancer biology: the concept of evolutionary contingency; and in parallel, to identify the triggers for tumour growth and progression, and potentially revealing therapeutic vulnerabilities.",Deciphering Clonal Evolution in Hereditary Renal Cell Carcinomas,9916258,U01CA247439,"['Address', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clear Cell', 'Clear cell renal cell carcinoma', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Cyst', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microtomy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Oncology', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Urology', 'VHL mutation', 'Variant', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome', 'Work', 'anaerobic glycolysis', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical center', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'kindred', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'multidimensional data', 'neoantigens', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'progression marker', 'recruit', 'stable isotope', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,"FRANCIS CRICK INSTITUTE, LTD",U01,2020,317425,0.004002929326868093
"Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma Project Summary  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and therapeutic options are limited. There is a pressing need to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease in order to identify new effective biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC. Proteins are the functional molecules of the cell, and many clinically validated biomarkers and most drug targets are proteins; however, cancer omics studies have relied primarily on genomic platforms. By melding genomics with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the new field of proteogenomics provides an opportunity to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant protein networks that drive cancer pathogenesis. A major National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the more recently established International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC), are promoting an integrated proteogenomics approach that is postulated to produce sounder therapeutic hypotheses and a new generation of protein biomarkers. The central purpose of this application is to forge a collaboration between a CPTAC team in the US and an ICPC team in China to enable proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discoveries in hepatitis B virus-related (HBV+) HCC, which attributes to 85% of HCC cases in China. The two teams bring complementary expertise required for a successful proteogenomic study of HCC. The China team has already generated the most comprehensive multi-omics dataset yet produced for liver cancer by applying proteogenomic profiling to a Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort (CHCC-HBV) with 159 cases, and the data has been preliminarily analyzed through collaborative efforts between the two teams. In this application, the US team will perform deep computational analyses of the proteogenomics data to generate prognostic models and therapeutic hypotheses, which will be experimentally validated in cell lines, animal models, and clinical specimens by the China team. Our specific Aims are: Aim 1) To develop and validate a protein-based prognostic model; Aim 2) To identify and validate subtype-specific causal drivers and therapeutic strategies; and Aim 3) To characterize the immune landscape of HBV+ HCC. Successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge on HCC biology as well as new prognostic and treatment strategies for HBV+ HCC. Meanwhile, experimentally validated computational methods developed in this project will have wide application to the study of other cancers and other non-cancer diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV+ HCC) attributes to 85% of all HCC cases in China, and therapeutic options are limited. This project will forge a collaboration between a computational team in the US and an HCC oncology team in China to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of a large Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort using the new proteogenomic approach that systematically integrates genomics and mass spectrometry-based proteomics data.

"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model.

"Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ABSTRACT  The principle investigator, Dr. Travis Schrank, MD, PhD, is a first-year faculty member in the University of North Carolina Department of Otolaryngology. He has been hired in a surgeon-scientist role and presently has 75% protected time for research. His past training in computational biophysics and experimental biochemistry have motivated and equipped him pursue an independent research career in computational genomics and head and neck cancer molecular biology. The presented research aims are an outgrowth of the PI's ongoing efforts to improve RNA based methods for identifying NRF2 active head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors.  NRF2 is the key transcriptional regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, and has been related to poor patient outcome and radiation response in multiple cancer types. Mutational activation of NRF2 is observed in 8% of HPV negative (HPV-) HNSCC. However, our estimates based on RNA transcription suggest that NRF2 is aberrantly activated in 24% of HPV- HNSCC. This work has identified atypical NRF2 and CUL3 variants which are associated with NRF2 activation. The functional consequences of these variants will be investigated (Aim 1). We also find that the prohormone Neurotensin is highly expressed in NRF2 active HNSCC tumors without NRF2 pathway mutations. Our preliminary data suggest that pro-Neurotensin may activate NRF2, through a previously unreported interaction with KEAP1 (a regulator of NRF2 stability). This novel function of pro-Neurotensin will be investigated in Aim 2. Suppression of NRF2 activity is well known to radio-sensitize cancer cells. We have also identified a partially suppressed pattern of NRF2 target expression in HPV associated (HPV+) HNSCC tumors, which are highly sensitive to radiation. p14ARF is also highly expressed in HPV+ HNSCC, binds NRF2, and suppresses transactivation of some NRF2 targets. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that NRF2 target suppression due to high levels of p14ARF, contributes to the radio-sensitivity of these tumors.  The proposed work will be impactful for several reasons, 1) the tumor subclassification method developed address the very common problem of imperfect clinical/genomic annotations of tumor RNA expression data, 2) the first known/reported signaling role for the prohormone form of Neurotensin will be explored, and 3) identification of NRF2 targets associated with radiation response may suggest novel approaches to treatment.  UNC has exceptionally strong institutional expertise and resources related to cancer genomics. The mentorship committee also has key project specific expertise in NRF2 biology, computational genomics, p14ARF and Neurotensin. Collectively the mentorship team has previously trained four K award recipients and includes two surgeon-scientists who can provide critical career guidance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant activation of the transcription factor NRF2, a key regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, is frequently seen in HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally validated somatic mutations of this pathway can only account for 30% of the observed activation. The objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize novel genomic and proteomic mechanisms of NRF2 activation in order to advance strategies for the diagnosis and targeted treatment of patients with NRF2 active tumors.",Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,10126595,K08DE029241,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'CDKN2A gene', 'CUL3 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Faculty', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'MDM2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Mediating', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Neurotensin', 'Neurotensin Receptors', 'North Carolina', 'Otolaryngology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Primary Carcinoma', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiosensitization', 'Reading Frames', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Surgeon', 'TP53 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transactivation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'genetic signature', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral HPV-positive head and neck cancers', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'prohormone', 'proneurotensin', 'radiation resistance', 'radiation response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational genomics', 'treatment risk', 'tumor']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K08,2020,173993,0.025885166029756004
"Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface Project Summary/Abstract  Cancer has long been described as a disease of the human genome, and the past two decades of research have largely focused on characterizing the molecular mechanisms that contribute to its origin, progression, and treatment resistance.1,2,28–30 Over the past year, a series of seminal studies have identified significant non-human, microbial contributions in the development and advancement of solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and germline cancer syndromes, as well as the variable efficacy of chemo- and immunotherapy, shedding light on what may be considered cancer’s ‘second’ genome (the metagenome).3–11,25 The extent of these microbial contributions across diverse cancer types in the human body and their implications on broader clinical management, however, remain largely unknown.12 Answering basic questions regarding the presence and specificity of such microbes in certain cancer types and cancer stages could guide the rational design of new, microbially-based diagnostics, prognostics, and therapies. Further, addressing more complex questions regarding the interactions of these microbes with cancer and host immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could provide critical insight into the design of personalized immunotherapy, cancer vaccines, and cancer risk profiles, hopefully leading to improved patient outcomes.  This proposal builds on a recent analysis of the cancer microbiome in 14,038 primary tumors, through which I have shown that virtually every major tumor type in the human body carries a unique, discriminative microbial signature. Inspired by recent evidence that highlights the role of pathogen-centric immunobiology in cancer development16,17 and the ability of microbes to powerfully modulate the systemic and local immune systems,5,6,8,18 I now hypothesize that the broad existence of these cancer microbes provides an evolutionary advantage for tumors to escape the host immune system’s recognition and response. I also hypothesize that the same immunological processes that are known to shape cancer’s mutational and phenotypic landscapes are concurrently shaping the tumor microbiota. Armed with patient germline HLA allele data and inferred immune cell abundances in the same primary tumors as those in our cancer microbiome study, I believe these hypotheses are finally testable. Aim 1 of this project seeks to investigate them alongside immunotherapy response data.21,22 Complementarily, Aim 2 seeks to define the intratumoral spatial distribution of the cancer microbiome and associated immune cells using a combination of computational and wet lab analyses. These results will contribute to our foundational knowledge on what is becoming the immuno-oncology-microbiome (IOM) axis.  The proposed interdisciplinary research will take place at UC San Diego in collaboration with microbiome, systems biology, tumor immunology, pathology, and oncology experts, who serve as mentors and advisors to me. Through their invaluable mentorship, hands-on learning, networking, and additional graduate coursework, I will grow into the translational and effective physician-scientist I so desire to be. Project Narrative The long-held view that cancer is a “sterile” entity is starting to change. New evidence suggests that intratumoral microbes can affect the development, progression, and treatment resistance of solid tumors. My preliminary findings suggest that unique microbial signatures exist for every major tumor type in the human body, and this proposal extends that work to characterize the interfaces between these cancer microbes, cancer cells, and the host immune system.",Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface,9911763,F30CA243480,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Alleles', 'Binding', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future Generations', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer cell', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'design', 'digital', 'enteric infection', 'genome sequencing', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hands-on learning', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'pathogen', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prognostic', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microbiota', 'tumor microenvironment', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2020,37593,0.01691054286422121
"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9891974,R37CA218570,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Canis familiaris', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dog family', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Silicones', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Veterinarians', 'analysis pipeline', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'citizen science', 'classifier algorithm', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational cancer research', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2020,653673,0.012027890807111113
"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9981710,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,488621,-0.006150851898615752
"A Statistical Physics Framework for Understanding the Role of Repeat RNA in Tumor Immunity PROJECT SUMMARY Transcriptional dysregulation in tumors can induce the abundant expression of repetitive elements in cancerous cells compared to normal tissues, where they are often transcriptionally silent. Such transcripts have been associated with better outcomes to cancer immunotherapies, as they can modulate the tumor immune microenvironment and generate an under-quantified source of tumor neoantigens. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA is both a critical mechanism for initiating the immune response in the tumor microenvironment and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets. Using a set of approaches from statistical physics, our team predicted repetitive element RNA directly stimulates receptors of the innate immune system, confirmed this hypothesis in a key subset of immune cells, and showed repeat expression can correlate with response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Repeat RNA is therefore both a novel biomarker for the innate immune response in cancer and a potential therapeutic target to modulate tumor immunity. We will utilize a set of tools, developed by our team, from statistical physics to characterize repeat RNA recognition by innate immune receptors in silico and their role in tumor-immune co-evolution, both with and without the application of immunotherapy (Aim 1). Next, we will characterize the spatial context of repeat RNAs in the tumor immune microenvironment and the co-localization of predicted immunostimulatory RNA with activation of immune signaling, along with in depth immune-phenotyping of the state of the immune microenvironment in vivo (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform functional validation of our predictions on human immune cells to validate mechanisms of recognition and the specific immune subsets responsible for repeat recognition via a set of in vitro assays (Aim 3). Our goal is to use approaches from statistical physics to quantify the role of repetitive elements in tumor immunology, their rules of recognition by innate immune receptors and their part in facilitating cytolytic T cell activity. In doing so we will combine novel RNA detection technologies to study their spatial distribution and localization in cancers; state of the art immune-phenotyping; and mathematical models to characterize their direct role in tumor evolution. We hypothesize that our approach from statistical physics will identify the key structural and sequence features of repeat mediated immune activation in solid tumors and shed light on their specific consequences for tumor evolution and therapeutic efficacy. PROJECT NARRATIVE An emerging paradigm in cancer immunology states that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA in cancer is a critical mechanism for engaging tumor intrinsic and extrinsic immune and regulatory factors, and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets. Using a set of approaches from statistical physics, our team predicted repeat RNA stimulates receptors of the innate immune system, confirmed this hypothesis in a key subset of immune cells, and showed classes of repeat RNA can correlate with response to immunotherapies.

"Developing high-throughput genetic perturbation strategies for single cells in cancer organoids PROJECT SUMMARY  To address the complexity of heterogeneous cancers that are resistant to chemotherapy and frequently recur or metastasize, we propose to develop a set of tools based on multidisciplinary innovations combining Synthetic Biology, Cancer Organoid Technology, and Bioinformatics. These Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) include: Synthetic Promoter Activated Recombination of Kaleidoscopic Organoids (SPARKO), Combinatorial Genetics En Masse (CombiGEM), and single-cell RNA sequencing panorama (Scanorama). SPARKO can annotate heterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi- colored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale, massively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis of large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools focus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor distinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models (NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable targeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for sequencing. These tools will be applied to a large number and variety of NGCMs to optimize experimental protocol. To ensure success, we have convened an outstanding team: PI Timothy K. Lu, MD, PhD, has made strikingly original contributions to Synthetic Biology tools that enable high-throughput genetic interrogation of cancer cell drug dependency; PI Ömer Yilmaz, MD, PhD, has extensive expertise in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and has developed novel technologies to maintain patient-derived colon cancer organoids for in vivo modeling; and PI Bonnie Berger, PhD, will use her expertise in bioinformatics and her Scanorama algorithm to integrate data across all tumor types based on dynamic single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We are also supported by leading experts in cancer biology and various cancer types at both the basic science and clinical oncology frontiers of cancer research. The collective commitment and multidisciplinary contributions of the entire team ensure the establishment of an openly distributed investigative tool set that accelerates advancements in cancer biology and therapeutic discovery PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop a collection of Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) to enable wide adoption of the Next Generation Cancer Models in the cancer research community.

"Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, resulting in dramatic anti-tumor responses in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% show any survival benefit, and of these it is not clear what predicts response. ICIs have been thought to work primarily through reactivation of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CD8s) residing within the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Recent work, however, indicates that various CD4+ T cell populations outside the tumor microenvironment (peripheral immune system) likely play critical roles in carrying out anti-tumor immune responses. Given increasing evidence that immune cells other than CD8s are important for anti-tumor immunity, it is critical to identify and characterize these cells in order to understand their roles during HNSCC tumorigenesis and ICI therapy, which are currently unknown. This proposal by Dr. Kyle Jones, DDS, PhD seeks to significantly advance our understanding of cancer immunology in the context of HNSCC tumors, with the ultimate goal of improving existing ICI therapies and developing new treatment strategies. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, he will use a novel systems biology approach to accomplish the following Aims: (AIM 1) Quantify the effects that HNSCC tumors have on systemic immunity and determine if these changes are conserved across tumor, blood, and regional lymph nodes; (AIM 2) Determine how the ICI atezolizumab alters the intratumoral and peripheral immune states of HNSCC patients and if these changes are associated with tumor response to therapy. These Aims will define how HNSCC tumors alter the composition and function of patients' immune systems at single cell and systems levels as well as identify/characterize the specific immune cells that contribute to anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones will use high throughput single-cell methods such as mass cytometry, multiplexed ion beam imaging, and single-cell RNAseq along with established analytic pipelines on HNSCC patient specimens obtained before and after ICI therapy. The innovation of this approach, which permits simultaneous study of all immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, will reveal how changes in any individual immune cell population affects the overall immune state. It will also be important for the discovery of additional immune cell populations and biomarkers associated with HNSCC anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones's long-term career goal is to become an expert, leader, and independent translational scientist in the fields of head and neck cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Through this K23 award, he will obtain the additional training in experimental immunology, single cell analysis methods, computer programming, advanced statistical methods, and career development he needs to successfully achieve this goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of only 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently emerged as an exciting new treatment modality resulting in complete tumor regression in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% of HNSCC patients show any long-term survival benefit. This proposal seeks to significantly improve our understanding of HNSCC cancer immunology by identifying/characterizing the immune cell populations associated with durable antitumor immune responses following ICI therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving ICI efficacy in HNSCC patients.",Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer,10011787,K23DE029239,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antitumor Response', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytometry', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Head and neck structure', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Mus', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'checkpoint therapy', 'computer program', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxic CD8 T cells', 'draining lymph node', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymph nodes', 'maxillofacial', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'open label', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,184680,0.052106237060741134
"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,9980817,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Visualization', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,374477,0.02260941331911733
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,9842277,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,413430,0.040207416560164466
"Targeting the Immune Onco-GPCRome  as a Novel Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy Strategy ABSTRACT Recent advances in checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) inhibiting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the limited response rates in most cancers suggest that new approaches and targets are clearly needed to fully elucidate the underlying biology of dysfunctional and exhausted CD8 T cells in cancer and achieve durable responses (cure). G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most intensively studied drug targets since they play key roles in many physiological processes, and they have remained longstanding favorable pharmacological targets. Here, we plan to first use novel computational approaches analyzing multiple single cell RNAseq databases to deconvolute T cell heterogeneity in order to generate a transcriptomic GPCR signature for tumor infiltrating T cells. Preliminary data shows an upregulation of prostaglandin receptors, EP2 and EP4, on exhausted T cells, suggesting that these GPCRs that are coupled to the G protein Gs, and their downstream signaling cascades may be dampening anti-tumor cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, leading to exhaustion. We hypothesize that activation of EP2 and EP4 on CD8 T cells and the subsequent Gs signaling leads to decreased cytotoxic and migratory activity that nullifies the effectiveness of PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade. Put together, EP2 and EP4 may represent promising candidates as immune checkpoints that can be targeted in combination with CBI as part of novel multimodality precision immunotherapy approach to reactivate the immune system to destroy tumors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have led to major treatment breakthroughs for a number of different cancers, but the majority of the cancer patients do not respond to immunotherapies, and clinical responses are often not durable. The research outlined in this proposal will illuminate the roles of G protein coupled receptors on immune cells in cancer that may lead to the identification of novel targets that need to be blocked in combination with current immunotherapies to achieve complete responses (cure).",Targeting the Immune Onco-GPCRome  as a Novel Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy Strategy,9992888,F31CA250488,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Antigens', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bypass', 'CD28 gene', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CTLA4 gene', 'CXCR3 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dinoprostone', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Functional disorder', 'G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'G-substrate', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Graph', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Heterogeneity', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'In complete remission', 'Joints', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Production', 'Prostaglandin Receptor', 'Receptor Activation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Diseases', 'WFDC2 gene', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'antitumor effect', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell motility', 'chemokine receptor', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxic', 'cytotoxicity', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'expression vector', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'migration', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F31,2020,38401,0.04521329855719239
