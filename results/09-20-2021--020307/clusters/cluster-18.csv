"New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, tuberculosis (TB) kills more people each year than any other infectious disease, but around 40% of TB cases go undiagnosed each year. This leads to continued transmission and a slow rate of decline in global TB incidence. Community-based TB screening interventions are one strategy for increasing the early diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis. Knowledge is lacking on when community-based TB screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and on the impact of these interventions on TB transmission. This study addresses the first of these knowledge gaps by identifying epidemiologic signals that predict high yields for community-based TB screening, and by assessing barriers to optimal implementation of community-based screening programs. It addresses the second knowledge gap by measuring transmission within communities that receive TB screening interventions, and by identifying potential sites of transmission both within and outside the community. Aim 1 applies random forest regression to data from a community-based screening program to create a decision tree that uses information about past TB patients to predict whether a commnity is likely to have high levels of undiagnosed TB in the present. Aim 2 is a mixed-methods study focusing on people who were missed by TB screening interventions, which will help understand the barriers to successful implementation. Aim 3 uses whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates to determine the proportion of TB cases attributable to recent transmission within intervention communities, using this metric to evaluate the impact of screening interventions on transmission. Aim 4 uses social network analysis to identify sites of transmission within and outside intervention communities. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce global TB morbidity through improved community-based screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand (a) when community-based tuberculosis screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and (b) the impact these interventions have on tuberculosis transmission. This knowledge will improve community-based tuberculosis screening interventions and thus contribute to the reduction of global tuberculosis morbidity.",New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions,9781984,DP2MD015102,"['Address', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical sequencing', 'community intervention', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening program', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIMHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,DP2,2019,2353629,0.015154675393077544
"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",9821551,K01AI141616,"['Affect', 'Anti-malarial drug resistance', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomass', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticides', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Onchocerciasis', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'World Health Organization', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'infectious disease model', 'low income country', 'malaria transmission', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,146551,0.025236214978445665
"LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sober Grid™ has developed a smartphone-based mobile application currently in use by over 120,000 individuals worldwide who are in, or seeking, recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. The “Grid”, as it is known, is a mobile-based, social recovery community providing rapid context- specific peer support, efficient help seeking, motivational enhancement exercises, and member ratings of support content – all aimed to prevent relapse. The overarching goal of this phase II project is to extend the current capabilities of the Sober Grid app to achieve a comprehensive social recovery support app featuring intelligent, context appropriate resource matching and 24/7 rapid response peer-coaching that is effective in reducing disordered substance use and is cost effective. We hypothesize that providing this functionality to high-risk members will be acceptable, feasible, increase access to and engagement with resources, and have a positive effect in increasing time to relapse and days of consecutive abstinence. The company’s priority commercial goal is to leverage the insights gained from its large database of information and behaviors recorded in its existing addiction recovery-focused social network, combined with its recently completed SBIR phase I work, to identify users at risk for relapse and deliver tailored lay and professional peer support, telehealth, and provider interventions prompted by near real-time automated risk indicators built into an Enhanced Sober Grid (ESG) solution. The specific goals of this proposed phase II project include: (1) implementing the relapse risk scoring algorithm successfully developed in phase I in a production environment, (2) developing a ML resource relevancy matching algorithm, and (3) using this system to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability as well as to estimate the effect on abstinence of providing peer-coaching and resource information to a national sample of Sober Grid members in recovery from non- alcohol/nicotine substances who are predicted to be at high risk for relapse. We will accomplish our objectives by: (Aim 1) Implementing an accurate, near real-time production risk prediction system; (Aim 2) Developing an enhanced, in-app substance-addiction recovery resource locator; and, (Aim 3) Determining the feasibility, acceptability and estimating the effect size of the proposed ESG among high relapse-risk participants in recovery from opioid, stimulant, or cannabis use. The expected impact of this project is to substantially enhance Sober Grid's ability to deliver effective and timely interventions to the right individuals, at the right time – including those high-need and underserved populations that would otherwise lack access to care and draw considerable resources from the healthcare system. This capability holds the promise to reduce drug and alcohol relapse and the associated negative health impacts at both an individual and societal level while reducing the total cost of providing treatment services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sober Grid is combining near real-time risk prediction with automated phone-app messaging, peer-coaching, and resource visibility and transparency in order to dramatically improve support for recovery from substance abuse. The strategy is to provide continuously available responsive connection and support with simple and familiar ways to search, filter, sort, identify, and review/rate resource options in order to lower overall relapse rates within the population, enabling Sober Grid users to achieve improved health outcomes and institutional payers to reduce the total cost of achieving those outcomes. Over time, the innovations resulting from this project will significantly reduce costs for individuals, public and private payers, the healthcare system, and society at large.",LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION,9681118,R44DA044062,"['Abstinence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Traits', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Published Comment', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'alcohol relapse', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug relapse', 'effective therapy', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'marijuana use', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'member', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'provider intervention', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sobriety', 'social', 'social media', 'stimulant use', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2019,499907,-0.03399475675746399
"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9852112,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,413898,0.08635003869613375
"Expert Guiding Technology to Help Individuals with Developmental Challenges Build Life and Vocational Skills Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) remains the most effective and scientifically-validated approach to remediate the deficits due to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID). There are serious challenges in delivering effective ABA: unavailability of effective treatment in many places; high instructor turnover; loss of program fidelity due to complexity and instructor variability; onerous data collection that directs attention away from the learner; and the time sink of creating required reports and charts that steals time away from instructional activities. A software platform named GAINS (Guidance, Assessment and Information System) is being developed that uniquely incorporates artificial intelligence to overcome problems in delivering ABA. GAINS is powered by expert guiding software that incorporates knowledge of ABA practice and curricula personalized for the individual with developmental challenges. Like Google Maps that guides you step-by-step and updates as you go along, GAINS guides instructors and caregivers and adapts to client responses on the fly. In this way, expert guiding technology reduces a priori training requirements in ABA while providing real- time apprenticeship coaching to overcome variability in instructor experience and improve program fidelity. Improved program fidelity promotes better learning outcomes of individuals with ASD and ID. The project will evaluate and iteratively innovate expert guiding technology to support the powerful, but difficult to implement, ABA technique of Task Analysis (TA). There are two overarching aims: 1) conduct scientifically-valid, clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of expert guiding technology to support instructors to better help individuals with developmental challenges due to ASD and ID learn life and vocational skills and use the results in Phase I to develop larger, more comprehensive clinical trials to be conducted in Phase II; and 2) use clinical trials in Phase I and Phase II to more effectively identify and prioritize iterative innovations in expert guiding technology as part of successive Design Science Research Cycles. Single Case Research Designs (SCRD) will be used to evaluate expert guiding technology interventions to support Task Analysis. SCRDs are a viable alternative to large group studies such as randomized clinical trials. Single case studies involve repeated measures, and manipulation of an independent variable. SCRD studies allow for rigorous experimental evaluation of intervention effects and provide a strong basis for establishing causal inferences. Advances in design and analysis techniques for SCRD have made SCRD studies increasingly popular in educational and psychological research. Chimes Delaware will be the site for clinical trials. Chimes Delaware is one of the largest providers of community services for adults with intellectual, autism, and co-occurring disabilities. The project team has worked together for many years and is uniquely qualified. If successful, the increase of scientifically-validated technical capabilities of expert guiding technology will profoundly affect clinical practice. The clinical trials proposed in this project will provide new scientific knowledge on the efficacy of expert guiding technology to overcome problems in delivering quality ABA therapy. Iterative innovations of expert guiding technology will greatly increase the technical capabilities.

"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Augmented Reality Platform for Feedback and Assessment in STEM elementary education ABSTRACT This SBIR Phase I project will build evidence-based content, challenges and assessments that promote: simulation-based learning; troubleshooting and critical-thinking; and diversity and inclusion in STEM learning. The approach will be transferable by design to teaching and measuring learner performance across scientific disciplines. Emerging digital content in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is already transforming science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education from the abstract and static learning models of the past to the applied and dynamic learning experiences of the future. These technologies have promise in delivering simulation environments capable of nurturing deep learning and higher-level thinking in K-12 students through practical experience, hand-on exercises and real-life applications, such as troubleshooting. Digital AR and VR educational content is beginning to address and develop these skills, but a platform has yet to be developed to effectively enable broad adoption in elementary settings. Cost efficient methods to provide formative feedback and gather summative evaluations for Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) is also an unmet need. The successful completion of the proposed project will provide an evidence-centered content delivery and assessment framework as well as tool for addressing NGSS performance expectations that is transferable across topic areas and readily scalable for large-scale national implementation. The content will intentionally incorporate aspects of context and diversity of characters to ensure inclusion of groups that are historically underrepresented – specifically females and ethnic minorities. NARRATIVE Success in the workforce of the future will require the high-level thinking skills that the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize. Emerging digital content in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is transforming science and engineering education from the abstract and static learning models of the past to the applied and dynamic learning experiences of the future, through practical simulation-based experiences, but these lack the capability for performance assessment crucial to teachers and decision makers.

"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their

improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and

"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will take existing research software and significantly enhance it so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",9882671,U24EB028990,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Budgets', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SMART health', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoking', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief intervention', 'burden of illness', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'good diet', 'handheld mobile device', 'healthy weight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'open data', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reduced substance use', 'repository', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'software development', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIBIB,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,399297,0.0190527196431845
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9735228,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,397016,0.05199253483587938
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Improving the Pelvic Health of Women and Girls Through the Use of a Digital Coaching Platform ABSTRACT More than 50 million women suffer from pelvic health disorders (PHDs) in the United States, a number that is projected to nearly double by 2050. These conditions cost the healthcare system billions annually and negatively affect educational and employment opportunities, quality of life, and fertility of patients. While studies suggest that PHDs can be managed and improved with education, practitioners are often confronted with patients who delay seeking treatment until their symptoms and conditions are advanced. Below Your Belt (BYB) is developing a platform that disrupts the costly, painful, and stigmatizing cycle of poor pelvic health in the U.S. The platform is a mobile, web based, a consumer-facing chatbot, with a working name of CeCe, that delivers pelvic health information in a familiar, accessible manner. CeCe will engage Mom with interactive and medically accurate content, positioning her to become the central source of information for her family and her social network. BYB has developed and tested a functional prototype of CeCe, which is based on feedback received from hundreds of women surveyed. In Phase I, BYB, together with Northwestern University and a highly qualified team of consultants will optimize CeCe and test the feasibility and acceptability of a chatbot to deliver pelvic health information. In Aim 1, The current prototype will be examined and enhanced to a web-based platform. Simultaneously, verified conversational and educational material will be added to the existing content to make it more robust. Then, a round of usability testing will be conducted. Updates to content and functionality will be completed based on initial usability results, and if any issues are uncovered, they will be addressed before the start of Aim 2. In Aim 2, Northwestern University will conduct a larger usability and knowledge-gained study with 36 women (recruitment target of 30% low income women). Questionnaires will be used to ascertain whether participants had measurable increase in knowledge after completing the two-week interaction with CeCe and to assess ease of use/acceptance. Exit interviews will be conducted to gain qualitative data around ease of use, interest in CeCe, content preferences, perceptions of achievement in relation to increased awareness of pelvic health and confidence or comfort sharing pelvic health information. At the conclusion of Phase I, BYB will have successfully demonstrated that CeCe’s final prototype is an acceptable and feasible model for increasing pelvic health knowledge. In addition, BYB will have a complete assessment of CeCe’s acceptability and insight into participants’ 14-day experience with the chatbot, and an understanding of whether a mom might feel confident or comfortable sharing any information she has learned.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,9838650,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2019,225000,0.044035400987287074
"Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration There is an enormous deficit in students’ understanding of fractions in the United States. Fifth grade fraction knowledge predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Therefore, addressing this deficit is a particularly important area for early intervention. With this Fast-Track grant, Deep Fractions Learning , we propose to transform the way in which students learn core math curriculum so that materials are more interactive and engaging, promote deeper learning of content, and are aligned with the Common Core. More specifically, we will develop and evaluate a digital curriculum for grades 3-5 covering the fractions domain that combines games, collaboration, and an inquiry approach. We propose to develop an innovative technology infrastructure that will integrate Teachley learning games, Success for All’s (SFA) cooperative learning framework, and rigorous lesson content. We will integrate research into the design process and work with Johns Hopkins University to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Outcomes. The intervention will encourage four direct outcomes for students, namely improved: 1) conceptual understanding of fractions, 2) procedural fluency with fractions operations, 3) mathematical justification, and 4) motivation. First, the curriculum will build both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency, providing strong visual models within engaging games that motivate students to practice. The collaborative learning model and inquiry approach will improve students’ mathematical justification. Finally, we encourage these outcomes within a motivational support structure designed to foster engagement and self-efficacy. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in the area of fractions during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since each additional math class students complete in high school more than doubles the odds of college completion (Adelman, 2006), the intervention has the potential to make a real difference in whether students achieve sustainable careers versus being stuck in low-wage jobs. Fractions knowledge in the fifth grade strongly predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Intervention in this essential content area will improve students’ math ability in the short and long term, which in turn will lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as greater high school graduation rates and college attendance.","Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration",9789518,R44GM130162,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Common Core', 'Control Groups', 'Demographic Factors', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graduation Rates', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Mathematics Curriculum', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Wages', 'Work', 'boys', 'career', 'college', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'girls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mathematical ability', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reading ability', 'success', 'teacher', 'third grade', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,463456,0.08559497875047183
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,9750927,UH3HL144163,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Libraries', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Self Management', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'chatbot', 'copayment', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'individual response', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety net', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'treatment as usual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,UH3,2019,1455863,0.019140432015547753
"Mighty Girls and the Mighty Moment App:  Leveraging Innovative Technology, Narrative Theory, and Social Media to Empower Young Girls to Resist Peer Pressure to Engage in Risky Behavior The goal of this SBIR Phase I is to prevent risky sexual behaviors among young female adolescents in order to reduce negative outcomes such as early pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. To accomplish this goal, we propose using state-of-the-art technology to develop a scalable and multicultural version of the efficacious Mighty Girls program and evaluate its usability and feasibility. Early sexual initiation remains costly to individuals, families, and society. However, development of effective sex education curricula for early adolescence has been inhibited by a lack of prevention science strategies and political issues. In answer to these challenges, Norris and Hecht/REAL Prevention created Mighty Girls (MG), a brief sexual-pressure resistance curriculum grounded in Social Cognitive Theory and the Communication Competence Model and guided by Narrative Engagement Theory. MG was developed with parents, public school educators, Planned Parenthood, and the clergy, and has demonstrated efficacy in a state with an abstinence only policy for sex and HIV prevention education. MG can be implemented as a stand-alone or component of any sex education curriculum regardless of local politics because of its focus on peer resistance and decision making. The curriculum consists of 6 brief lessons that can be taught during or after school and an interactive videogame to teach sexual pressure resistance, improve self-efficacy, and motivate resistance. However, the program targets only Latinas and technology has not adequately advanced to take the game component to scale without prohibitive costs. Hence, we propose to develop a scalable, multicultural version that relies on a narrative app, Mighty Moment, in lieu of the interactive videogame. Phase I will establish usability and appeal of the multicultural curriculum version and the app, both of which will be developed through formative work involving a multi-racial/ethnic group of 7th grade girls, and review of the evidence-based multicultural keepin’ it REAL curriculum and current literature. Additionally, the Mighty Moment app prototype will be developed in collaboration with Tapp Technologies, a leading innovator in health promotion technology. This app will guide girls in creating and narrating a story about being “Mighty” (using their “Mighty Girls” powers to resist sexual pressure without making enemies of the initiator). Phase II will evaluate MG program efficacy after incorporating social media, with girls’ stories submitted to Storybooth.Com to be selected for animation and posting on their website where such animations receive over 40 million views, creating a powerful mechanism for dissemination of peer resistance stories and intervention messages. Efficacy of the existing intervention, need for risky sex reduction interventions that surmount political barriers, and REAL Prevention’s success in commercializing health interventions through partnerships with 4-H clubs, Planned Parenthood, and D.A.R.E. America argue for the proposed project’s promise. Project findings also lay the foundation for developing a similar program for boys. This Phase I SBIR will develop and demonstrate the usability/feasibility of a multicultural adaptation Mighty Girls, an effective program for reducing risky sexual behavior among 12-14- year-old girls, that harnesses the power of mobile technology and social media using a novel story writing app. The adaptation will make Mighty Girls easily scalable as either a stand-alone or a component of school- or community-based curriculum, and capable of reaching millions of youth a year. Mighty Girls is unique from other sex and HIV prevention programs because it focuses on decision making and resisting the peer pressure that leads to risky sexual behavior, skills that are valued equally by communities that want abstinence only and communities that want abstinence plus sex education.","Mighty Girls and the Mighty Moment App:  Leveraging Innovative Technology, Narrative Theory, and Social Media to Empower Young Girls to Resist Peer Pressure to Engage in Risky Behavior",9844786,R43NR018977,"['14 year old', 'AIDS prevention', 'Abstinence', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Americas', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clergy', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Control Groups', 'Country', 'Cultural Diversity', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Ethnic group', 'Family', 'Female Adolescents', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Phase', 'Planned Parenthood Federation of America', 'Policies', 'Politics', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention education', 'Prevention program', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Puppet', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Service setting', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Problems', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'animation', 'base', 'boys', 'brief intervention', 'commercialization', 'computer game', 'cost', 'digital', 'early adolescence', 'early pregnancy', 'early sex initiation', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'girls', 'high risk sexual behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'meetings', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'peer', 'phase 1 study', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'school district', 'seventh grade', 'sex', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'societal costs', 'success', 'theories', 'usability', 'web site']",NINR,"REAL PREVENTION, LLC",R43,2019,224943,-0.01147424522136483
"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). Significance: Education in clinical settings is often challenging, infeasible, risky, difficult to organize, time-consuming, and expensive. Due to these barriers, the value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, the purpose of mannequin use in education is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, physical mannequins have several fundamental limitations that do not allow them to demonstrate the many unique phases and expressions of a disease or person-to-person differences in anatomy and physiology. This limits the ability for a learner to view dynamic changes over time and to explore disease progression and consequences of interventions. Hypothesis: This research hypothesizes that existing, current mannequins can be enhanced through an innovative and practical Augmented Reality solution. In the Phase I effort a prototype system and sample educational material covering Pressure Ulcer care was developed and analyzed through pilot studies with Nursing educators, Doctoral Degree in Nursing (DNP) students, and pre-licensure students. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated a high degree of positivity and exceptional enthusiasm and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded. Specific Aims: In Phase II the following aims are proposed: 1) Design a comprehensive suite of course content and design the technology's integration into a College of Nursing course, 2) Develop a production-ready system, and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation of the system. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will open new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education. 3T",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9778054,R44AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Course Content', 'Decubitus ulcer', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensure', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Nursing Schools', 'Nursing Students', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'impression', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'miniaturize', 'person centered', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'teacher', 'virtual']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2019,779815,-0.005494504422683044
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9778578,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2019,225000,0.07569305603161419
"Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement ABSTRACT Post-treatment substance use disorder (SUD) relapse rates are high (40-60% at one year), with relapse occurring early (median time to relapse 1-3 months), indicating that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Telehealth and VR technologies have the ability to greatly increase the accessibility of highly engaging recovery support. Combining these two approaches provides a unique opportunity to create a highly engaging, cost-effective take home recovery support solution targeting the critical transition from inpatient care. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its existing highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app, to develop a convenient and cost-effective integrated take-home combined VR and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) that begins in the inpatient clinic. RecoVRi is designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from inpatient to home, thereby reducing the risk of relapse and associated health and monetary costs. Sober Grid is collaborating with TRIPP, Inc. to utilize TRIPP’s immersive wellness platform. The design of the TRIPP experience leverages a large body of existing research on the use of VR technology in the mental wellness arena and utilizes proven mindfulness structures, targeted sound frequencies, visuals and interactions that have a multiplicative effect when administered through immersion. The Sober Grid Network will create a support wrapper to the VR experience that facilitates access to crisis management experts and community for the person in early recovery. The unique combination of a personalized and targeted self-regulation toolkit and community and professional support is a key differentiator for this service. In phase I of the project, we will develop and pilot test a proof-of-concept RecoVRi VR-mindfulness protocol and intervention to ascertain feasibility and acceptability (Aim 1). In phase II of the project, a production-quality intervention will be developed with new VR content created by the TRIPP development team specifically targeting themes supporting recovery from alcohol, stimulant and opioid SUD separately (Aim 2). We will then test post-treatment recovery support engagement in the RecoVRi intervention in comparison to treatment as usual in a randomized comparison trial involving 80 patients receiving inpatient treatment and transitioning to the home setting (Aim 3). Over the span of both phases, we will seek regulatory guidance from the FDA in order to attain clearance for use of the RecoVRi intervention as a therapeutic medical device (Aim 4). NARRATIVE Substance use treatment research findings indicate that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app to develop and test a convenient and cost-effective, integrated, take-home combined, virtual reality and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from the inpatient clinic to home.",Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement,9898123,R44DA050222,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Android', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Well in self', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'social', 'sound frequency', 'success', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment program', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2019,225000,-0.01299521237175263
"Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens ABSTRACT  This SBIR Phase I project uses formative evaluation strategies to develop, test, refine, and evaluate an alpha prototype of the 10-session, evidence-based Strengthening Families Program 7-17 and SFP Home-Use DVD as a web-assisted platform. The Specific Aim of the new “SFP Online!” program is to increase family accessibility and engagement by transitioning from costly group-based, facilitator-led, parenting and family skills training to low cost web-delivery. SFP draws heavily on theories that integrate family dynamics (monitoring, bonding, and communication), parenting skills, youth drug etiology (risk and protective factors), and social learning. Substantial empirical evidence from 14 RCTs with diverse families and locations shows that SFP works with large program effect sizes to reduce behavioral health risks and substance abuse. Phase I will determine whether the adapted online version can reproduce outcomes of the facilitator-led family group version with minimal loss of fidelity, efficacy, and vitality. Five integrated formative evaluation strategies involving 380 participants including ten focus groups with potential end users (100 parents and 100 youth) from SFP providers nationwide will explore adaptations, usability, feasibility and barriers to use. Consumer preference surveys tapping both recent SFP DVD users and agency service providers will explore factors that may mitigate or enhance delivery of SFP Online. This approach based on input from both parents and youth and providers will ensure that SFP Online is culturally and developmentally appropriate. We will also rely on key informant interviews with 50 family service providers and community stakeholders to address barriers to implementation and the eventual integration of SFP Online into existing prevention and treatment strategies. We will include interviews with prevention scientists and e-learning experts to review the architectural plan and ensure fidelity to current prevention and technology initiatives. These consumer surveys will inform a product specification plan supporting a “wireframe technology” to make SFP Online a viable web-assisted program. To create the alpha prototype in Phase I SFP LLC will collaborate with 3C Institute, a leading software development company with extensive expertise building interactive multimedia technology for behavioral health interventions. 3C Institute will employ its proprietary Dynamic e-Learning Platform (DeLP), a customizable technology that integrates the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. LARS Research Institute, a leading behavioral technology transfer company will assist in the evaluation of the program’s adherence to the standards of evidence. We will also draw on extensive community support based on 30 years of administering SFP products to family service agencies nationwide and other CBOs that emphasize parent training, and drug and child maltreatment prevention. The proposed formative evaluation strategies and collaboration with ten national prevention and e-learning experts should ensure timely and successful completion of the Phase I research activities and produce an effortless transition to the Phase II build-and-test stage. Project Narrative – SFP Online! This Phase I SBIR study seeks to adapt the Strengthening Families Program, an evidence-based facilitator-led family skills training and youth drug prevention program with family classes and entertaining video clips, to a web-based platform. Providing parenting training and drug prevention via the web offers tremendous cost savings and provides an efficient conduit for mass dissemination. The proposal utilizes five formative evaluation strategies to examine the steps required for technological adaptation and which will retain program and implementation fidelity.",Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens,9557402,R43DA046238,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Consumer Preferences', 'Cost Savings', 'Cultural Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Prevention Program', 'E-learning', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based program', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Family dynamics', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Location', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Program Evaluation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Sexuality', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Problems', 'Speed', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral health intervention', 'child protection', 'child protective service', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'court', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'formative assessment', 'foster care', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interactive multimedia', 'mindfulness', 'preference', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'rehearsal', 'satisfaction', 'scaffold', 'service providers', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social learning', 'social media', 'social skills', 'software development', 'theories', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,"STRENGTHENING FAMILIES PROGRAM, LLC",R43,2018,150054,0.006686969092454099

"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and

"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9547265,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,395830,0.05199253483587938
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,9507942,K24NR015812,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient oriented research', 'physical model', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social media', 'tool', 'training opportunity']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2018,184769,0.03349176489884526
"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning; however, these props are fundamentally limited.",Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers,9622753,R44GM130247,"['Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Promotion and Education', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'animation', 'career', 'college', 'commercialization', 'design', 'digital media', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'mid-career faculty', 'pedagogy', 'prototype', 'retention rate', 'science education', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2018,224984,0.056349383788946064

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9519046,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'societal costs', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2018,620198,0.08060295906206308
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),9314333,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,593935,0.0745429022832093
"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context. We plan to accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze medicine reminder successes and failures. We are well positioned to significantly advance the clinical translation of mobile device-based medicine reminders for use by heart failure patients. The proposed work represents a natural extension of our prior research and is innovative because it will partner real-time methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in the development of activity-aware prompting.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,9313191,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventable cancer cause', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral construct', 'computer center', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'tailored messaging', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2017,139974,0.02176537533934457
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on

"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects – delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment – have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses. Depression is common, recurrent, and debilitating among college students, and the majority of depressed individuals (>70%) do not pursue treatment. Internet-based interventions are effective, low-cost, and easily disseminated, and the goal of this project is to test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response to an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression. This innovative approach - which relies on an integration of data across units of analysis (e.g., self- report, neurocognitive, and neural data) – promises to optimize treatment outcomes for depression, and therefore, reduce associated negative consequences including academic problems, risky behavior engagement, and suicidality.",Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder,9328159,R56MH109566,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'college', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'minority student', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuromechanism', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'reward expectancy', 'screening', 'suicidal behavior', 'support tools', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R56,2017,139359,0.03289312828845663
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9368213,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,397661,0.05199253483587938
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9449181,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,663165,-0.026622968586663263
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9285614,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2017,747607,0.08060295906206308
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),9109063,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,580914,0.0745429022832093
"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context. We plan to accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze medicine reminder successes and failures. We are well positioned to significantly advance the clinical translation of mobile device-based medicine reminders for use by heart failure patients. The proposed work represents a natural extension of our prior research and is innovative because it will partner real-time methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in the development of activity-aware prompting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention.

We will validate the hypothesis by designing and evaluating machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity- aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance.            ",Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients,9111690,R21NR015410,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economic Burden', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'success', 'technology development']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,175607,0.021974388392773735
"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,9118118,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventable cancer cause', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral construct', 'communication behavior', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2016,139974,0.02176537533934457
"Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects – delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment – have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses. Depression is common, recurrent, and debilitating among college students, and the majority of depressed individuals (>70%) do not pursue treatment. Internet-based interventions are effective, low-cost, and easily disseminated, and the goal of this project is to test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response to an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression. This innovative approach - which relies on an integration of data across units of analysis (e.g., self- report, neurocognitive, and neural data) – promises to optimize treatment outcomes for depression, and therefore, reduce associated negative consequences including academic problems, risky behavior engagement, and suicidality.",Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder,9314157,R56MH109566,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'college', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'minority student', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuromechanism', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'reward expectancy', 'screening', 'suicidal', 'support tools', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R56,2016,364740,0.03289312828845663
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8892259,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,613425,0.0745429022832093
"Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncontrolled hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and many patients fail to take their antihypertensive medication as prescribed. We propose to use artificial intelligence (AI) to allow short message service (SMS or text messages) interventions to adapt to patients' adherence needs and substantially improve medication taking. The aims of the study are to: (1) develop AI methods for adaptive decision-making in human- centered environments and demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting AI-enhanced SMS medication adherence intervention, (2) demonstrate that the intervention can ""learn"" by adapting the SMS message stream according to patients' medication taking over time, and (3) examine potential intervention impact as measured by improvements in medication adherence and systolic blood pressures. We will recruit 100 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Adherence and other covariates will be measured via surveys at baseline, 3- and 6 months; blood pressures will be measured at baseline and 6 months. Participants will be given an electronic pill-bottle adherence monitor. Participants will receive SMS messages designed to motivate antihypertensive medication adherence. Message content and frequency will adapt automatically using AI algorithms designed to automatically optimize expected pill bottle opening.

"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8852594,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comprehension skill', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,194301,-0.03709584234853266
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.            ",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,8949658,K24NR015812,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'patient oriented research', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2015,188616,0.03349176489884526
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8935645,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,652270,0.08060295906206308
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user.

"Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncontrolled hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and many patients fail to take their antihypertensive medication as prescribed. We propose to use artificial intelligence (AI) to allow short message service (SMS or text messages) interventions to adapt to patients' adherence needs and substantially improve medication taking. The aims of the study are to: (1) develop AI methods for adaptive decision-making in human- centered environments and demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting AI-enhanced SMS medication adherence intervention, (2) demonstrate that the intervention can ""learn"" by adapting the SMS message stream according to patients' medication taking over time, and (3) examine potential intervention impact as measured by improvements in medication adherence and systolic blood pressures. We will recruit 100 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Adherence and other covariates will be measured via surveys at baseline, 3- and 6 months; blood pressures will be measured at baseline and 6 months. Participants will be given an electronic pill-bottle adherence monitor. Participants will receive SMS messages designed to motivate antihypertensive medication adherence.

"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current approaches to medical education produce new physicians with insufficient clinical competency to practice effectively with limited supervision, which has serious implications for patient outcomes during hospital off hours. Up to 70% of patients admitted to a hospital are admitted on nights or weekends, when staffing is low and residents may be in charge of patient care. Off-hours care is linked to an increase in medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates. Negative patient outcomes during off hours are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of residents in their first postgraduate year. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Develop a scoring algorithm that automatically evaluates students' written justifications of diagnostic strategy. 2) Build a taxonomy of strategy failures from students' diagnostic justifications. 3) Work closely with SIUSOM and other medical schools contemplating the addition of diagnostic reasoning assessment to their curriculum. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 4) Develop an application based on the Phase I proof of concept with refined algorithms for scoring, categorizing reasoning failures and targeted remediation. 5) Evaluate the learning application for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a limited field trial with students at SIUSOM. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During hospital off hours negative patient outcomes including medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of first year residents. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation.

"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.            ",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8764466,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Simulate', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,234765,-0.03709584234853266
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8815713,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2014,709980,0.08060295906206308
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.                   ",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8496352,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,636036,0.0745429022832093
"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.            ",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,8581564,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operator Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior change', 'communication behavior', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2013,140793,0.02176537533934457
"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions.

"Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR application entitled ""Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging"" is designed to create a low cost, continuous care decision support text messaging intervention to increase treatment adherence, decrease drop-out and prevent the recurrence of problem drug use during and following professionally facilitated addiction treatment. Based on the high drop-out rates during treatment and relapse rates following treatment, it has been proposed that addiction should be treated similarly to other chronic illnesses that require long-term intensive monitoring and care. Recent research on adaptive phone-based continuing care interventions supports the use of a chronic care addictions treatment model both for those attempting to change illicit substance abuse and society as a whole. There is an emerging literature on the use of text messaging and ecological momentary assessment through mobile phones for low cost automated disease management of chronic illnesses like asthma and diabetes. Text messaging is ideally suited to addiction continuous care because the mobile phone is capable of providing low cost adaptive monitoring and feedback wherever and whenever relapse is most likely to occur. The proposed study is designed to develop the content, structure, programming and user interface of an automated interactive drug treatment continuous care text messaging intervention that can be modulated by the severity of symptoms during and following substance abuse treatment. The intervention will include web-based assessment, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), adaptive supportive messaging based on assessment results and counselor/social network alerts. The intervention is designed to both retain persons in treatment and help them sustain long-term change following treatment. We will obtain outside feedback and review of the preliminary intervention through focus groups with a heterogeneous group of clients enrolled in substance abuse treatment. Thought leaders with expertise in addiction, continuous care, text messaging and ecological momentary assessment will help develop the core content and features of the intervention. Specific content and programming benchmarks for success will determine Phase II feasibility. If successful this messaging program has the potential to significantly improve outcomes for the 2.2 million chronic illicit substance users who seek treatment each year without the financial burden and/or time commitment needed to implement traditional counselor based continuing care interventions. Additionally, the program can be used by clients of private addiction specialists and could be adapted to reach substance abusers in earlier stages of change as a stepped care intervention. Despite the emerging literature on the importance and effectiveness of continuing care  interventions for drug abuse, few treatment programs implement these strategies into care  due to lack of resources and financial incentive. We propose to create a low cost adaptive  continuing care text messaging support and monitoring program through the mobile phone  to help reduce drug abuse treatment drop-out and relapse among illicit drug users  attempting to change. If study aims are achieved, the proposed intervention could be easily  disseminated to providers, improve long-term psychosocial and health outcomes for  substance users and reduce overall healthcare costs related to substance abuse.",Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging.,7998538,R43DA029359,"['Abstinence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asthma', 'Back', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Care', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'data management', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'financial incentive', 'improved', 'meetings', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment program', 'volunteer']",NIDA,"MOBILE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, LLC",R43,2010,119348,-0.059189849375118404

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal focuses on the development of accessible artificial intelligence (AI) software for individualized tutoring and formative assessment in chemistry education. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the very first AI tutoring systems for chemistry that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. An AI tutoring methodology formulated with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. Furthermore, classroom teachers can obtain individualized assessment reporting and diagnostic information for visually impaired students on demand, as if from a ""virtual teaching assistant"". Feasibility of Phase I was demonstrated by developing a prototype accessible AI tutoring program that received certification in the National Federation of the Blind's (NFB) Nonvisual Accessibility Web Application Certification Program. In previous SBIR projects, Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of AI and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch. Chemistry comprises the majority of the content standard for physical science in the National Science Education Standards, and yet is one of the most neglected areas in terms of quality educational software, in general, and is a particularly acute problem for the blind and visually impaired. Through recent federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the very first artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for chemistry.

"MUSC Minority Student Development Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goals of this program are to: 1) increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students choosing a research career in the biomedical sciences, 2) enhance the quantity and quality of URM students enrolled in the doctoral program in the College of Graduate Studies, 3) prepare them for a successful career in biomedical sciences, 4) provide structured activities that enhance the interaction of minority and majority students and 5) increase the number of URMs in the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). To accomplish these goals a Minority Recruitment Committee will be developed to assist in recruiting URMs. An MUSC ""Science Day"" will be implemented to expose minority students to the excitement of biomedical science research. Undergraduate science advisors will nominate potential URM Ph.D. applicants who will attend ""Science Day"" with a parent and the advisor. The SURP will be expanded by five students, designated as E.E. Just Scholars. These SURP participants will interact with minority graduate students via a Big Brother/Sister program. A summer pre-matriculation course to review basic biochemical and molecular concepts will be available for all new students. All students will participate in a ""Diversity in Science"" course that will foster the interaction of minority and majority students that focuses on issues related to minorities in biomedical science. URM graduate students will serve as Graduate Student Ambassadors to HBCUs and present seminars to undergraduates. Funds will be provided for URM graduate students to present their research at a national meeting. A Mentoring Committee will be developed to 1) monitor and advise URM doctoral students through the graduate training program, 2) assist with career development and 3) organize the content of the ""Diversity in Science"" course as well as career workshops. Internal and External Advisory Committees will provide oversight for the program.

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7389728,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2008,373102,0.05616184476991588
"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal focuses on the development of accessible artificial intelligence (AI) software for individualized tutoring and formative assessment in chemistry education. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the very first AI tutoring systems for chemistry that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. An AI tutoring methodology formulated with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. Furthermore, classroom teachers can obtain individualized assessment reporting and diagnostic information for visually impaired students on demand, as if from a ""virtual teaching assistant"". Feasibility of Phase I was demonstrated by developing a prototype accessible AI tutoring program that received certification in the National Federation of the Blind's (NFB) Nonvisual Accessibility Web Application Certification Program. In previous SBIR projects, Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of AI and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch. Chemistry comprises the majority of the content standard for physical science in the National Science Education Standards, and yet is one of the most neglected areas in terms of quality educational software, in general, and is a particularly acute problem for the blind and visually impaired. Through recent federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the very first artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for chemistry. The goal of the present research is to bring the full power and benefit of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired using Internet-capable screen access technology.          n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR),7220194,R44EY016251,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Categories', 'Certification', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Purpose', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Special Education', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Students', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'blind', 'braille', 'commercialization', 'concept', 'design', 'disability', 'falls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'physical science', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'science education', 'simulation', 'success', 'teacher', 'technological innovation', 'virtual']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R44,2007,366168,0.0546652026713024

"REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a summer program for undergraduates with non-biological sciences backgrounds that will provide cross-discipline training and experiences in combining the physical sciences backgrounds of the participants with concepts and approaches of functional genomics and cell biology to address biomedical research problems. The intended impact of our program is to encourage participating students to pursue graduate education in biomedical sciences, followed by careers in biomedical research.       Six students will be selected each year to pursue 10-week research experiences in one of eleven laboratories at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Instruction in functional genomics and cell biology will be provided through workshops and a series of seminars. Students will work as a group on a cross-discipline case study in wound-healing. In addition, students will receive instruction in research ethics, scientific writing, and career opportunities in biomedical sciences. At the conclusion of the summer, students will present their work at a poster session and receive evaluations. Students will be encouraged to publish their results in the Journal of the Ohio Association of Science.  To build community among these students, they will participate in a series of social and cultural events.   Formative evaluations will be used to alter and fine-tune the Program, and summative evaluations will be carried out at the conclusion of each summer and again, as the participants graduate from their undergraduate institutions, to measure the long-term impact of the Program on the participating students. n/a",REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology,7226706,R25GM072834,"['Academia', 'Academy',

"Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary lifestyle is directly associated with disease and reduced quality of life. While the general United States population is suffering from an epidemic of sedentary lifestyle, Latinos are even more sedentary than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Notably, Latinos suffer from greater rates of morbidity and mortality of conditions associated with being sedentary than non-Hispanic whites. One concern is that due to cultural artifacts, socioeconomic circumstances, and language barriers, Latinos have limited access to public health interventions that promote active lifestyles. Modern behavioral informatics interventions that use theory-based computer-run expert systems show great promise to provide more effective interventions for hard-to-reach populations at lower cost. The present application is in response to PA-04-153, 'Health Disparities Among Minority and Underserved Women.' We aim to both culturally and linguistically modify an evidence-based, inidvidually tailored intervention, founded on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, to target sedentary Latinas. This print-based, expert system intervention has been developed and tested by Dr. Bess Marcus and her team, who have spent 18 years developing programs to increase physical activity in sedentary adults. The study will involve two phases: 1) a formative research period in which 100 Latinas will be recruited to provide data on how to modify the current tailored intervention to be culturally congruent and 2) a pilot randomized trial with 80 recruited Latinas to test the modified intervention against off-the-shelf bilingual health educational materials for Latinas. The formative research phase will involve an iterative process of qualitative data collection and intervention modification, with: 1) translation from English to Spanish; 2) an initial round of exploratory focus groups to obtain data on unique themes to include in the modified intervention; 3) a second round of confirmatory focus groups to examine responses to modified intervention materials; and 4) a series of intensive individual cognitive interviews to examine readability and comprehension, consistency of perception of materials with theory, and conceptual integrity of the intervention materials across English and Spanish. The pilot study will provide data on feasibility as well as on effect size of the modified intervention to inform a future clinical trial. Secondary analyses will explore differences in intervention effect based on levels of acculturation and of ethnic identity.             n/a",Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas,7197865,R21NR009864,"['Hispanic Americans', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'focus groups', 'lifestyle', 'public health']",NINR,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R21,2006,210300,0.05962790678956115
"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantum has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the first artificial intelligence (Al) tutoring systems in chemistry education. This work successfully addressed several longstanding, clearly articulated needs for improved interactive educational software. A leading distributor for the U.S. and Canada, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories, as well as prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, have entered into long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. The aim of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to bring the full power and benefits of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired. There is a considerable need for improved educational software for science education in general, but the problem of quality educational software materials for the blind is known to be particularly acute. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum Al Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind using Internet-capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation here is the development of advanced Al tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the first Al tutoring systems that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. A formulation of an Al tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. This project can only be accomplished by working intimately with experts in education for the blind, and Quantum has arranged a number of important partnerships in this respect, for research as well as commercialization of the resulting technology, including: the National Federation of the Blind, the American Printing House for the Blind, Pearson Learning Group, Bartimaeus Group and Henter Mathematics. n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software,6880607,R43EY016251,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'blind aid', 'chemistry', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'educational resource design /development', 'science education', 'technology /technique development']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2005,100721,0.031239728034484777
"Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KIT Solutions, a private firm specializing in developing intelligent, Knowledge-based Information Technology (KIT) solutions for the field of health and human services will partner with the University of Pittsburgh, Office of Child Development (OCD) to develop a Web-based, interactive software application of a Family Support Management Information System (FS MIS) for nationwide dissemination. This innovation is called Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT).  Family support centers, like other human service programs and agencies across the country, are being required to implement best practices and document the impact of their services to funders, policy makers, and the community. However, most family centers do not have a state-of-the-art web-based information system available to them that integrates best practice, expert knowledge, and daily management functions. The proposed LIFT system will address these critical needs and has great potential for nationwide commercial distribution. The combination of KIT'S proven record of developing knowledge based information technology and OCD's over 20 years of research and practice in family support services will greatly enhances the chance of success for this business venture. In Phase I of the project, we will produce prototype software demonstrating the benefit, usability, and feasibility of a web-based, interactive, intelligent system for use by family support centers across the nation. The extent of which LIFT enables family center staff to build skill, capacity, access information and expert knowledge, to enhance their work will be the focus of this phase. In Phase II, we will fully develop the prototype LIFT to a commercial grade web application for nationwide dissemination and further validate the commercial potential and impact of LIFT, using a quasiexperimental design, which will involve a large number of users across multiple sites. In Phase III, we will seek private funding for marketing the system to the national market. We intend to use the Microsoft.Net Platform and follow XML web service concepts to develop the proposed innovation. Collection of a subscription fee will be used to support the maintenance and future development of the system. n/a","Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT)",6990440,R43HD049229,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'family', 'focus groups', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'social service']",NICHD,"KIT SOLUTIONS, INC.",R43,2005,104545,0.000617133288035245
"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.  We envision such interactive  technologies for entire populations delivered at relatively low costs through the mail or  over the Internet or an Intranet.  Commercial applications include marketing to healthcare  providers, namely managed care organizations, and employers who share the burden of  healthcare expenses.  n/a",Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management,6859455,R44HL070549,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior therapy', 'clinical trials', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dietary lipid', 'health education', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrient intake activity', 'patient oriented research', 'weight control', 'weight loss']",NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2005,207836,0.0623210085085463
"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample.

"Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Precollege science education, particularly middle school where students first encounter courses dedicated to the sciences, has lacked the attention of the scientific and education communities. As a result, many middle level teachers are marginally prepared to teach contemporary science, the development of effective curricular materials has lagged, and schools devote inadequate resources and support to science. In the prior Phase I grant, experiment modules have been designed by scientists that address the core content of middle school Life Science. They utilize live (aquatic) organisms in the class room to stimulate inquiry into the properties of living organisms and make connections with related environmental health problems to link student learning with the world around them. Human environmental health was chosen as the biomedical context because it strongly relates to the macroscopic world in which middle school students live and provides age-appropriate learning opportunities for students as they begin to understand organisms and their underlying structures and mechanisms. During Phase II our specific objectives are 1. To infuse middle school Life Science education with attractive experiment modules that stress student inquiry. 2. To mount a comprehensive dissemination program with school systems that work with large numbers of minorities and students from families with lower socioeconomic status. 3. To utilize a 'train the trainer' method for lead teachers to achieve wide dissemination of the modules that involves close collaboration between scientists and educators and the lead teachers. 4. To provide teachers with full support to implement and sustain the modules through a science resource center. 5. To continue the development of the content of the modules. 6. To obtain a thorough formative and summative evaluation of the effectiveness of the curriculum modules and the entire mechanism for their delivery. 7. To establish a robust program to sustain the module dissemination to teachers after the completion of the grant.         n/a",Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII,6857683,R25RR014267,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'artificial intelligence', 'curriculum', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'ethnic group', 'female', 'learning', 'meeting /conference /symposium', 'minority health professional', 'science education', 'secondary schools', 'social support network', 'teacher', 'university student', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R25,2005,268813,0.031187542880703488
"LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stottler Henke Associates in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia University, proposes to build a software system for teaching scientific inquiry in the context of nutrition science, The goal of the proposed research is to develop a computer based instructional system - called LiFESim - that teaches accurate and detailed information about food and the food system -- from production of food on the farm through food processing and transportation, to impacts of food on personal health and on the natural environment in terms of waste and pollution. The software will complement an existing health science curriculum, developed at Teachers College for 4th-6th graders, called ""Linking Food and the Environment"" or LIFE, developed from an NIH Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) RR 12374 (1997-2004). Our system will be based on the paradigm of role-playing simulation used in such popular computer games as SimCity and The Sims: students using the software assume roles in a simulated environment and learn from the consequences of the decisions that they make in those roles. Using the simulation paradigm students will be able to explore the dynamics of large-scale systems, such as those the food transportation system in ways that are not possible with the existing curriculum. For example, the simulation would allow students to explore the impact of changes in transportation patterns on food delivery. Our system will provide explicit coaching in applying scientific methods for investigation. We will also explore learning strategies that will encourage students to critically examine - and hopefully improve - their dietary choices. We will complement simulation-based learning with two other artificial intelligence based methodologies - the use of lifelike pedagogical agents, and the use of case-based reasoning. During Phase I, we will develop a set of detailed instructional goals, use these to develop an initial system design, develop a limited prototype of the system, and then develop and perform an informal pilot study to evaluate the viability of our design. The pilot study will be conducted over a one-month period at schools in Hayward, California and New York City. Our Phase II effort will focus on developing an extensive design and performing detailed use testing of the system developed during Phase I.         n/a",LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR),6790401,R43RR019780,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'environmental contamination', 'food', 'food processing /preparation', 'health education', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrition', 'nutrition related tag', 'science education']",NCRR,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2004,100000,0.03245413364687205
"AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR proposal is aimed at advancing the state of the art in chemistry education software in a critically important respect demanded by students, teachers, administrators and Quantum Simulations, Inc. customers. The focus of this innovation is the development of meaningful interactive tutoring and assessment capabilities for chemistry problem solving. Empowerment of students to make the proper decisions about drugs through experiencing the scientific process requires a solid education in basic chemistry. Chemical formulas comprise much of the fundamental ""language"" of chemistry in which students must be fluent in order to succeed. The topic of writing and understanding chemical formulas, a cornerstone of all general chemistry classes, is a reasonable starting point for the development of an AI assessment system for student learning in chemistry. A solid understanding of chemical formulas is a prerequisite to success in chemistry required not only for literacy to make informed decisions about drugs from a scientific standpoint, but also to enable and prepare students to pursue careers in research related to drug abuse. Quantum has already successfully developed and commercialized an ITS for writing chemical formulas which will be used as the starting point for the present work. The proposed technology will benefit all students; however, it is specifically targeted to help those who have the greatest need, such as students of average or marginal performance and students from historically underserved groups, by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality science instructional software.  Quantum customers include textbook publishers, software providers, hardware vendors and distance learning companies. A prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, has entered into two long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. Quantum intends to employ an identical business model to commercialize the results of this project. n/a",AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse,6831228,R43DA018455,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug abuse education', 'educational resource design /development', 'human subject', 'science education']",NIDA,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2004,61750,0.02479369229340859
"Expert System Intervention--Domestic Violence Offenders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Male-to-female partner violence poses a major threat to the physical and emotional well being of women. Research assessing the efficacy of court-mandated domestic violence treatment programs has yielded disappointing results. A major problem with mandated treatment is that it tends to be standardized and 'one-size-fits-all,' neglecting individual differences in motivation level and readiness to change. We propose to individualize services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model (TTM) based intervention tailored to individual stage of readiness to end the violence. In Phase I the objective was to develop a stage-based computer-administered multimedia expert system intervention and self-help manual designed to be administered as an adjunct to traditional batterer treatment. In Phase II, the objective is to complete development of the intervention materials, translate them into Spanish, and assess their efficacy in a randomized clinical trial. English- and Spanish-speaking domestic violence treatment clients will be randomly assigned at treatment intake to the experimental (n=350) or control condition (n=350). Efficacy will be assessed by comparing the intervention and control groups on number of batterer treatment sessions attended, partner reports of recidivism, re-arrests for domestic assault, and several secondary outcome measures. n/a",Expert System Intervention--Domestic Violence Offenders,6736312,R44MH062858,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior therapy', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'male', 'motivation', 'psychological models', 'spouse abuse', 'violence']",NIMH,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2004,109651,0.07158016983877256
"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.  We envision such interactive  technologies for entire populations delivered at relatively low costs through the mail or  over the Internet or an Intranet.

"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals.

The research aims of this              randomized clinical trial involving over 800 at-risk Washington, D.C.-area       families of 7 to 11 year olds in components of the 16 week Strengthening         Families Program (SFP) are:  1) to test the differential efficacy of the         three major components of SFP-parent training (PT), children's skills            training (CT), and family skills training (FT) compared to a minimal contact     control (MT) on precursors and substance use/abuse employing a 2 x 4             experimental design; 2) to estimate the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness      of the SFP components with 400 African American families and 400 White           families; and 3) to empirically test several competing etiological and           intervention theories of drug use/abuse underlying the intervention design       by analyzing the survey research data from 1,600 12 to 19 year olds and the      800 intervention families using structural equation modeling, mediational        analysis, hierarchical linear modeling, latent growth modeling, and              transactional modeling (cross-lagged SEM, artificial intelligence, and           neural network simulations) for gender, race, and other sub-groups.  The         rationale for the component design is that a major question exists               concerning the efficacy of child-only interventions that group high-risk         children together as well as the added benefit of working with the family        together compared to parent-training only.  Demonstrating the importance of      involving parents and working with families would be very valuable               information for prevention providers.

"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals. An effective, low-cost expert system that can reduce the prevalence of depression on a population basis has significant commercial potential.  n/a",An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care,6708226,R44MH060522,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' cognitive behavior therapy', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted patient care', ' depression', ' health behavior', ' health care model', ' health care service utilization', ' health services research tag', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' mass screening', ' medical outreach /case finding', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' outcomes research', ' patient oriented research', ' primary care physician']",NIMH,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2003,581856,0.05196056271419381

"Expert System Intervention--Domestic Violence Offenders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Male-to-female partner violence poses a major threat to the physical and emotional well being of women. Research assessing the efficacy of court-mandated domestic violence treatment programs has yielded disappointing results. A major problem with mandated treatment is that it tends to be standardized and 'one-size-fits-all,' neglecting individual differences in motivation level and readiness to change. We propose to individualize services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model (TTM) based intervention tailored to individual stage of readiness to end the violence. In Phase I the objective was to develop a stage-based computer-administered multimedia expert system intervention and self-help manual designed to be administered as an adjunct to traditional batterer treatment. In Phase II, the objective is to complete development of the intervention materials, translate them into Spanish, and assess their efficacy in a randomized clinical trial. English- and Spanish-speaking domestic violence treatment clients will be randomly assigned at treatment intake to the experimental (n=350) or control condition (n=350). Efficacy will be assessed by comparing the intervention and control groups on number of batterer treatment sessions attended, partner reports of recidivism, re-arrests for domestic assault, and several secondary outcome measures. n/a",Expert System Intervention--Domestic Violence Offenders,6485358,R44MH062858,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior therapy', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' domestic violence', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' male', ' motivation', ' psychological models', ' spouse abuse']",NIMH,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2002,383964,0.07158016983877256
"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model.

"AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE MEDICATION ADHERENCE Despite advances in pharrnacotherapy for hypertension, as many as 75% of hypertensive patients' blood pressure is poorly controlled. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and is largely attributed to failure to adhere with antihypertensive medications. Nonadherence to medication regimens is a long-standing phenomenon that increases health care utilization and costs. Existing research demonstrates that a theoretical framework is needed to advance our ability to design effective interventions. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to medication adherence suggests that the model has strong explanatory power in this area and has the potential to guide intervention development. Phase l of this Fast-Track proposal involves the development and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 70% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized trial of an adherence expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on adherence, offering far greater availability at a low cost.

PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Up to 75% (37.5 million) of the 50 million Americans afflicted with hypertension fail to adhere to their medication regimen. Nonadherence with antihypertensives, which increases utilization of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency services, contributes a large proportion of drug-related morbidity and mortality the annual costs of which exceed $76 billion.

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample. The design is       a 4-group (Control, Modular Expert System intervention, Telecommunications           Intervention, Integrated Expert System Intervention) x 3 occasions (0, 12, and       24 months). Each behavioral risk factor will be intervened upon for 12 months        and the 3 risk factors will be related simultaneously. The 3 interventions           evaluated in this project have the potential to be easily disseminated at low        costs to entire populations of at-risk individuals.                                                                                                                       n/a",Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks,6400426,R01CA085807,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer prevention', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer human interaction', ' cost effectiveness', ' dietary lipid', ' education evaluation /planning', ' exercise', ' human subject', ' lifestyle', ' neoplasm /cancer education', ' nutrition aspect of cancer', ' nutrition education', ' nutrition related tag', ' saturated fat', ' smoking', ' smoking cessation', ' tobacco abuse', ' tobacco abuse education']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,R01,2001,813357,0.05580173565723955
"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals. An effective, low-cost expert system that can reduce the prevalence of depression on a population basis has significant commercial potential.  n/a",An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care,6404326,R44MH060522,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' cognitive behavior therapy', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted patient care', ' depression', ' health behavior', ' health care model', ' health care service utilization', ' health services research tag', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' mass screening', ' medical outreach /case finding', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' outcomes research', ' patient oriented research', ' primary care physician']",NIMH,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2001,150886,0.05196056271419381
"Educational Tools for Neuroscience   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SHAI proposes to bring two instructional        technologies together to compliment neuroscience lectures and distance               learning. Specifically we want to embed Computer Simulations of experiments and      the chemical, genetic, and physiological systems that underlie them within an        Intelligent Tutoring System. Simulations are excellent tools for revealing the       structure and dynamics of systems to students. They can also serve as a basis        of interactive experiments where students can ""discover"" the answers to              questions. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are an emerging educational            technology based on artificial intelligence research. They play the role of          tutor, in that they guide students with appropriate information or                   demonstrations when they are having difficulty with a lesson. They also              adaptively plan the presentation of new lessons based on evaluations of a            student's past performance and knowledge level. The objective of this phase I        proposal is to develop a prototype of NeuroTutor, a simulation-based ITS to          provide students with individualized instruction in a simulation centered            environment. Steps to reaching this objective include designing a curriculum,        developing instructional, presentations and support, developing appropriate          methods for Student Modeling and Diagnosis, and implementing a limited               prototype.

"AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE MEDICATION ADHERENCE Despite advances in pharrnacotherapy for hypertension, as many as 75% of hypertensive patients' blood pressure is poorly controlled. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and is largely attributed to failure to adhere with antihypertensive medications. Nonadherence to medication regimens is a long-standing phenomenon that increases health care utilization and costs. Existing research demonstrates that a theoretical framework is needed to advance our ability to design effective interventions. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to medication adherence suggests that the model has strong explanatory power in this area and has the potential to guide intervention development. Phase l of this Fast-Track proposal involves the development and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 70% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized trial of an adherence expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials.

"COMPUTER ASSISTED SMOKING CESSATION COUNSELING Encouraging physicians to counsel their smoking patients to quit is a national health priority. Physicians note several barriers to counseling smokers, including a lack of time, expertise, and organizational support. Using computers for collecting data to assist physicians in counseling patients is a way of improving the utilization of current computer technologies and behavioral models. Despite the efficacy of computer systems that enhance prevention, many barriers remain to the incorporation of such programs outside of research settings. Such a health communications system can assist a busy physician as it can query smokers about their habit, organize and present the information to provide ""best practice"" guidance for intervention and follow-up. The specific aim of this study is to determine, through systematic formative research, how to best integrate an innovative computer ""expert system"" into everyday used in primary care offices. In this formative (NCI-phase II) pilot study we propose to carry out focus group discussions with all parties directly involved in primary care practices (patients, physicians, staff) to understand how best to integrate the system into everyday practice. We will integrate the computer expert system in the practices of five primary care physicians. Our primary hypothesis is that the system will be able to be integrated into primary care practice and be used by more than 50% of smokers before their physician visit. Our secondary hypothesis is that the computer system will increase the number of smoking cessation counseling activities undertaken by physicians (e.g., set a quit date), measured by patient exit interviews. Armed with the data from the pilot study, our future aim will be to: a) further refine the computer expert system into an optimal package for integration into practice and b) to conduct a randomized clinical trial (NCI phase III) of the system in a more representative sample of physicians with sufficient power to evaluate the initial efficacy of the intervention using verified 7 day point prevalence and continuous abstinence as the primary outcomes.  n/a",COMPUTER ASSISTED SMOKING CESSATION COUNSELING,6175236,R03CA083346,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer human interaction', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' patient care management', ' primary care physician', ' smoking cessation', ' technology /technique development']",NCI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R03,2000,76181,-0.009072266889253954
"WEIGHT MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR DIABETES Approximately 90% of individuals with NIDDM are overweight. Overweight can exacerbate the course of the disease and co-morbid conditions, increasing health care utilization, morbidity, and mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight management are costly and serve only a small percentage of at risk individuals. Thus, population-based behavior change programs may be necessary to reach larger percentages of at risk individuals more cost- effectively. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to health behaviors involved in weight management suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves the customization and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 50% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized clinical trial of a comprehensive weight management expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on the targeted health behaviors as well as weight.

"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The people at greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice-involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for these individuals are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. Our prior research shows that delivering individual level treatment engagement interventions increase the rate at which individuals receive bup. Thus, our solution is to improve engagement in bup treatment among justice-involved individuals by 1) “disrupting” system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral by using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot to make the referral, and 2) addressing low individual motivation by programming the chatbot to deliver the BNI itself, without the need for a trained professional. Aim 1: Design and develop a functional prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (including focus groups) with all stakeholders; and (b) creation of a functional chatbot using ML and NLP that is integrated with a mobile application, an application program interface server, and an administrator portal. Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to BNI Chatbot or Treatment-as-Usual (TAU). Hypothesis 1. The BNI Chatbot group will have a higher percentage of participants attending their first bup appointment than the TAU group at 4 weeks (Primary outcome). Hypothesis 2. The BNI Chatbot group will demonstrate higher ratings of readiness and intention to engage in bup treatment, and lower opioid use, as measured by urine toxicology tests, than the TAU group at 4 weeks (Secondary outcomes). Hypothesis 3. The BNI Chatbot group will demonstrate higher ratings of satisfaction than the TAU group. PROJECT NARRATIVE Justice-involved individuals with Opioid Use Disorder coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine, a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of overdose death by half. Prior research shows that focusing on evidence-based treatment engagement interventions leads to high rates of individuals receiving buprenorphine.

"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10034797,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,733116,0.006060715492979149
"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9889974,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2020,575531,0.08635003869613375
"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",10133883,K01AI141616,"['Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Goals', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'disorder control', 'malaria transmission', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,48885,0.025236214978445665
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10029156,R01HL153543,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Education', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'brief intervention', 'clinically significant', 'dietary adherence', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'pilot trial', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'skills training', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2020,727923,0.004488845614315951
"LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sober Grid™ has developed a smartphone-based mobile application currently in use by over 120,000 individuals worldwide who are in, or seeking, recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. The “Grid”, as it is known, is a mobile-based, social recovery community providing rapid context- specific peer support, efficient help seeking, motivational enhancement exercises, and member ratings of support content – all aimed to prevent relapse. The overarching goal of this phase II project is to extend the current capabilities of the Sober Grid app to achieve a comprehensive social recovery support app featuring intelligent, context appropriate resource matching and 24/7 rapid response peer-coaching that is effective in reducing disordered substance use and is cost effective. We hypothesize that providing this functionality to high-risk members will be acceptable, feasible, increase access to and engagement with resources, and have a positive effect in increasing time to relapse and days of consecutive abstinence. The company’s priority commercial goal is to leverage the insights gained from its large database of information and behaviors recorded in its existing addiction recovery-focused social network, combined with its recently completed SBIR phase I work, to identify users at risk for relapse and deliver tailored lay and professional peer support, telehealth, and provider interventions prompted by near real-time automated risk indicators built into an Enhanced Sober Grid (ESG) solution. The specific goals of this proposed phase II project include: (1) implementing the relapse risk scoring algorithm successfully developed in phase I in a production environment, (2) developing a ML resource relevancy matching algorithm, and (3) using this system to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability as well as to estimate the effect on abstinence of providing peer-coaching and resource information to a national sample of Sober Grid members in recovery from non- alcohol/nicotine substances who are predicted to be at high risk for relapse. We will accomplish our objectives by: (Aim 1) Implementing an accurate, near real-time production risk prediction system; (Aim 2) Developing an enhanced, in-app substance-addiction recovery resource locator; and, (Aim 3) Determining the feasibility, acceptability and estimating the effect size of the proposed ESG among high relapse-risk participants in recovery from opioid, stimulant, or cannabis use. The expected impact of this project is to substantially enhance Sober Grid's ability to deliver effective and timely interventions to the right individuals, at the right time – including those high-need and underserved populations that would otherwise lack access to care and draw considerable resources from the healthcare system. This capability holds the promise to reduce drug and alcohol relapse and the associated negative health impacts at both an individual and societal level while reducing the total cost of providing treatment services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sober Grid is combining near real-time risk prediction with automated phone-app messaging, peer-coaching, and resource visibility and transparency in order to dramatically improve support for recovery from substance abuse. The strategy is to provide continuously available responsive connection and support with simple and familiar ways to search, filter, sort, identify, and review/rate resource options in order to lower overall relapse rates within the population, enabling Sober Grid users to achieve improved health outcomes and institutional payers to reduce the total cost of achieving those outcomes. Over time, the innovations resulting from this project will significantly reduce costs for individuals, public and private payers, the healthcare system, and society at large.",LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION,9897501,R44DA044062,"['Abstinence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Traits', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Published Comment', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'alcohol relapse', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug relapse', 'effective therapy', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'marijuana use', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'member', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'provider intervention', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sobriety', 'social', 'social media', 'stimulant use', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2020,471700,-0.03399475675746399
"Malaria Operations Research to Improve Malaria Control and Reduce Morbidity and Mortality in Western Kenya Project summary This application is for the fourth, 5-year CoAG between CDC’s Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). Activities take place in western Kenya under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), CDC, and LSTM and benefit from LSTM’s existing infrastructure in Kenya. The research strategy follows the 5 objectives of the NOFO. The first objective involves the expansion in 2020/21 of the epidemiological (1.1) and entomological surveillance (1.2) platform to track progress towards malaria transmission reduction targets following the introduction of population-wide interventions in 2021/22. To maintain low transmission status, this requires a shift from the existing periodic, district-level surveillance to systems where surveillance itself becomes an intervention and can detect individual geo-located cases near real-time for rapid notification and foci investigation. We will support the Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH) with their goal to digitise the data collected on their paper-based health registers using software that makes them scannable (1.1.5). This will include registers that capture case-burden data used in out-patient departments (1.1.6) and by community health workers as part of integrated community case management (ICCM) (1.1.7), and antenatal clinic registers that capture malaria infection prevalence during first antenatal clinic visits. This is a novel method to track the asymptomatic parasite reservoir in populations (1.1.8). Combined, this allows, for the first time, sustainable, daily, near real-time surveillance to track progress towards malaria transmission reduction targets. We will also conduct continuous malaria indicator household surveys (cMIS) to track malaria prevalence and intervention coverage (1.1.9) and entomological monitoring (1.2), both using adaptive sampling frameworks that can respond to challenges related to rapid changes in malaria transmission. As part of the second objective, we will implement population-wide interventions targeting malaria transmission, starting in 2021/22. The optimal combination of novel or improved interventions will be developed in close collaboration with CDC in 2020/21. This is likely to include enhanced case- management using digitally supported quality improvement approaches of ICCM, enhanced vector control with larval source management and insecticide-treated piperonyl butoxide (PBO) nets, and mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and ivermectin targeting the asymptomatic parasite reservoir (2.1). The third objective involves assessing the safety effectiveness of currently deployed antimalarials for the prevention (3.2.1) and treatment (3.2 and 3.3) of malaria in the context of increasing antimalarial drug resistance. We will liaise with CDC’s laboratories in Atlanta for the molecular monitoring of drug resistance. The fourth objective aims to maximise the public health impact by supporting the creation of a knowledge centre at the KEMRI’s CGHR for evidence synthesis and information exchange to enhance the translation of global malaria control policies (4). Objective 5 involves the strengthening of research capacity of the partners in Kenya by the provision of internships (5.1) and MSc, PhD and post-doctoral studentships and research leadership mentoring (5.1). PROJECT NARRATIVE This CoAg supports a collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), the US CDC and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support the Kenyan Ministry of Health to achieve major reductions in the malaria burden in areas with intense year-round transmission in western Kenya by 2025. The partnership will support the expansion of the malaria surveillance infrastructure to track the progress towards malaria transmission targets, evaluate different combinations of area-wide interventions targeting the malaria vector and asymptomatic parasite reservoir to reduce malaria transmission and strengthen case management. These activities will provide pivotal critical scientific knowledge to inform and guide malaria program implementation and reduce malaria-associated morbidity and mortality through the identification and scale-up and continued evaluation of evidence-based intervention strategies.",Malaria Operations Research to Improve Malaria Control and Reduce Morbidity and Mortality in Western Kenya,10126073,U01GH002290,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2020,550000,-0.027474754554974334
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9968231,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,387831,0.05199253483587938
"Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Objectives: This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-18-835 to detect, engage, and experimentally evaluate the effects of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (e-CBT) to treat college students in two Latin American LMICs with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder w/ or w/o comorbid common mental disorders (CMDs). Detection and engagement will be based on inexpensive internet-based self-report surveys and the intervention on inexpensive e-CBT to address the low resources in LMICs. Knowledge transfer to the primary LMIC collaborating institution (Mexican National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz [INPRFM]) will be a goal designed to facilitate dissemination to LMIC colleges/universities throughout Latin America. The study will build on prior research by collaborators in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey consortium and WMH International College Study (WMH-ICS) initiative documenting high prevalence, impairment, and unmet need for treatment of CMDs among college students around the world and significant effects of e-CBT in treating these disorders in high income countries. Specific aims/Design/Methods: First, we will carry out a pragmatic clinical trial with students seeking treatment for CMDs at student clinics in four universities in Colombia and Mexico. Students on waitlists for student clinic services will be offered a possibility of receiving guided e-CBT immediately while staying on the list. 50% of the students with CMD who express interest will be randomized to guided e-CBT and the other 50% to treatment as usual (TAU). Short-term aggregate intervention effects will be assessed 60 days after randomization and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will then use ensemble machine learning methods to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of guided e-CBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict which students will respond best to which intervention. We will then implement a SMART design in which we randomize 50% to the treatment arm predicted to be optimal by the PTR and the other 50% to randomization across arms. Additionally, we will carry out annual WMH-ICS internet-based mental health needs assessment surveys with a probability sample of students to estimate unmet need for treatment and barriers to treatment. Students screening positive for CMD who are not in treatment and report resistance to in-person treatment will be randomized to guided e-CBT to determine if access to guided e-CBT reduces the unmet need for treatment among students with CMDs who fail to seek treatment at student health clinics. Finally, the technology for screening, delivering e-CBT, and updating the precision treatment model, implemented initially by Harvard Medical School, will be transferred to INPRFM for dissemination to universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. That many senior regional mental health policy makers are trained at INPRFM and return for periodic policy summits, coupled with the close working relationship of INPRFM with the Pan American Health Organization, bode well for such dissemination efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research will provide valuable information to school administrators and government policy makers in the participating LMICs to document the burden of CMDs among university students, the extent of unmet need for treatment of these disorders, the effectiveness of inexpensive-scalable e-CBT interventions to treat these disorders, and for whom e-CBT is most effective. The technology transfer part of the study will build capacity to disseminate the methods used for screening, targeting, and intervention implementation so that they can be used in colleges and universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. Such an effort could have enormous public health implications for the region and serve as a model of evidence-based intervention planning and implementation for other parts of the world.",Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs,10053143,R01MH120648,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Colombia', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latin America', 'Latin American', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Pan American Health Organization', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Probability Samples', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'college', 'common treatment', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'nervous system disorder', 'outreach', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symposium', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'undergraduate student', 'university student']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY,R01,2020,10000,0.0655121796503942
"A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Tobacco smoking among women in Romania increased dramatically, by close to 30%, between 2011-2018 and the share of smokers with quit attempts decreased by 37%. Tobacco kills more than 8 million people a year around the world. The burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Romania, where 80% of the worldwide 1.1 billion smokers live. Our work showed that 30% of women smoke pre-pregnancy in Romania and half of the smokers continue during pregnancy. It is critically important to address tobacco smoking during pregnancy, an extraordinary window of opportunity for sustained cessation. The objectives of this application are to develop, implement, and test the feasibility and effectiveness of an adaptive mobile pregnancy tobacco cessation app-based intervention using deep tailoring and a self-nominated support person, and to build mHealth research capacity in Romania. We build on our pregnancy smoking cessation trials with spousal support in Romania, including the ongoing Smoke Free Together (SFT1.0) mHealth pilot trial and the Quit Together telephone counseling trial that shows preliminary evidence of efficacy, and on our partnerships in Romania. The central hypothesis is that the intervention will show evidence of feasibility and effectiveness in increasing positive support, pregnancy cessation, and postnatal abstinence. The app will be novel in its use of the unique functionality of smartphones, use of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep tailoring to continuously adapt the intervention, the emphasis on increasing positive support, and the use of the app by both smoker and quit-partner. The aims are: 1. (R21 phase). Develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of the SFT2.0 app-based mobile smoking cessation intervention with quit-partner support during pregnancy and postpartum in Romania; 2. (R33 phase). Test the SFT2.0 app-based smoking cessation intervention in a hybrid effectiveness and implementation randomized controlled trial; 3. (R21 and R33 phases). Develop mHealth research capacity by enhancing individual and institutional research capabilities in Romania and expanding the existing international research network. With respect to expected outcomes, the proposed application is anticipated to advance understanding of the effectiveness and implementation of a smartphone-based app for pregnancy smoking cessation with quit- partner support. Such results are anticipated to have a system wide sustainable positive impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal smoking as the intervention has a high potential to be adopted in the universal health system in Romania, with applications to the US and other populations. The development of the international research network and the individual and institutional mHealth research capacity building is expected to positively impact mHealth research in CEE and the neighboring region. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the findings will have a system wide sustainable impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoking in Romania and in Central and Eastern Europe, with applications to the US and other populations. The research is also expected to have an important impact on the methodology and design of mobile technology clinical and public health interventions during the reproductive years with lifelong potential implications. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help enhance health and reduce the burdens of human illness.",A Smartphone Intervention for Pregnancy Smoking Cessation with Peer Support,10057086,R21HD103039,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Eastern Europe', 'Effectiveness', 'Friends', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Romania', 'Self Determination', 'Series', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Spouses', 'Stress', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'craving', 'design', 'iterative design', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peer support', 'pilot trial', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal cigarette smoking', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'reproductive', 'smoking abstinence', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,1000,0.024373457427343932
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence.

"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10092402,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2020,830874,0.044035400987287074
"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). Significance: Education in clinical settings is often challenging, infeasible, risky, difficult to organize, time-consuming, and expensive. Due to these barriers, the value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, the purpose of mannequin use in education is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, physical mannequins have several fundamental limitations that do not allow them to demonstrate the many unique phases and expressions of a disease or person-to-person differences in anatomy and physiology. This limits the ability for a learner to view dynamic changes over time and to explore disease progression and consequences of interventions. Hypothesis: This research hypothesizes that existing, current mannequins can be enhanced through an innovative and practical Augmented Reality solution. In the Phase I effort a prototype system and sample educational material covering Pressure Ulcer care was developed and analyzed through pilot studies with Nursing educators, Doctoral Degree in Nursing (DNP) students, and pre-licensure students. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated a high degree of positivity and exceptional enthusiasm and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded. Specific Aims: In Phase II the following aims are proposed: 1) Design a comprehensive suite of course content and design the technology's integration into a College of Nursing course, 2) Develop a production-ready system, and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation of the system. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will open new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education. 3T",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9964623,R44AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Course Content', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensure', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Nursing Schools', 'Nursing Students', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'impression', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'miniaturize', 'person centered', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'teacher', 'virtual']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2020,688185,-0.005494504422683044
"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,9986013,UH3HL144163,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Libraries', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Self Management', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'chatbot', 'copayment', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'four-arm study', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'individual response', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety net', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'treatment as usual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,UH3,2020,1436253,0.019140432015547753
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10006915,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,231500,0.07438703757612619

"Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology Abstract  In the U.S., Latina women report higher rates of inactivity than their non-Hispanic White and male counterparts, and are disproportionately affected by related health conditions (e.g., cancer, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes). To address this public health crisis, evidence-based interventions that utilize state- of-the-art technology, theory and methods are needed to increase physical activity (PA) among this high-risk population. Recently, our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (N=205) to test the efficacy of a culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-language Internet-based PA intervention among Latinas (Pasos Hacia La Salud, R01CA159954) vs. a Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Although results were promising, the majority of participants still did not meet national guidelines for PA. In the ongoing renewal of R01CA159954, we will randomize 300 Latina women to either 1) the original Pasos Hacia La Salud tailored Internet-based PA intervention (Original Intervention) or 2) the data driven, enhanced version of the Pasos Hacia La Salud PA intervention (Enhanced Intervention).  The proposed supplement seeks to become the first trial to examine longitudinal patterns of PA adoption and maintenance across a series of longitudinal studies among Latinas. Traditional analytic methods would compare findings across studies and would estimate intervention effects at end of treatment controlling for baseline. We propose to use Integrative Data Analysis to combine data across studies and Latent Class Models to identifies patterns of PA adoption and maintenance. By using Latent Class Modeling (LCM), we will make full use of the longitudinal profile of PA data to identify patterns of change over time. LCMs use objective data (rather than a priori hypotheses) to subdivide the population into distinct groups of participants with similar profiles (of PA changes in this case). LCM can not only capture between- and within-subject heterogeneity, but can aid in the identification of meaningful subgroups within the population. By using this innovative method, we will not only reveal the inter-variability of PA over time but also elucidate the associations between such patterns and key psychosocial, behavioral and demographic predictors. Project Narrative Latinas exhibit high rates of inactivity and related chronic health conditions (including some cancers, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension), and are therefore in need of culturally and linguistically adapted physical activity interventions. The proposed supplement will build on the aims of the parent and renewal studies by using integrative data analysis to identify patterns of change in objectively measured physical activity over time, and test how these patterns relate to participant-level characteristics, including demographics, psychosocial and physiological predictors.",Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology,9764734,R01CA159954,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Endometrial', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Latina', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'burden of illness', 'cancer risk', 'data reduction', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'exercise intervention', 'group intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'longitudinal dataset', 'male', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'post intervention', 'protective effect', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social culture', 'success', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigorous intensity']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,216895,0.00875093244237327
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and  technological advances to optimize intervention effects. Results of this study will further the overall strategic  aims of the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD), which are to inform and develop effective interventions  for FASD. This project will also benefit from resources and collaborations within CIFASD to carry out the  proposed work, including recruitment of a diverse sample, diagnostic support, and outreach and dissemination.  This is one of the first studies to empirically test an mHealth intervention delivered by parents with peer-­ moderated support. It has the potential to reach many families raising children with FASD in need and could  reduce significant barriers to care, resulting in a greater public health impact.                   Project Narrative   The vast majority of families raising children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) cannot access  FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers. This project will develop and  evaluate the efficacy of a mobile health application to directly provide caregivers raising children with FASD

"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K24 application will allow Dr. Fukuoka to use her cardiovascular and diabetes research program as a platform to mentor and guide the careers of junior investigators in patient-oriented research (POR) and to further develop her leadership and mentoring skills.",Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses,9732635,K24NR015812,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clip', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'School Nursing', 'Secure', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'career', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'patient oriented research', 'pedometer', 'physical model', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social media', 'tool', 'training opportunity']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2020,183406,0.03349176489884526
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an integrated health coaching system that uses a smartphone app to promote healthy behaviors. We will adapt it for metabolic syndrome and evaluate its effectiveness in a corporate health setting.",HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME,10084515,R44HL142328,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Android', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Central obesity', 'Chronic', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee', 'Employee Health', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Fasting', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physical activity', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social support', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Water', 'Water consumption', 'Wellness Program', 'Workplace', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'contingency management', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'financial incentive', 'fitbit', 'follow-up', 'fruits and vegetables', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'social learning', 'standard care', 'sugar', 'sweetened beverage', 'usability', 'waist circumference', 'web-based assessment']",NHLBI,"HABIT DESIGN, INC.",R44,2020,726708,0.01242417744333883
