"Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to increase the precision and resolution of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative information such as tissue relaxation parameters (e.g., T1 and T2) measure tissue function and indicate disease-related changes in the heart, liver, brain, and other organs. For instance, T1 changes can provide evidence of diffuse fibrosis in the myocardium that can signal heart disease. Quantitative maps also are reproducible, directly comparable longitudinally and across subjects, and less affected by the properties of the scanner used, when compared versus common weighted (non-quantitative) clinical imaging. But, quantitative imaging involves more complicated and time-consuming pulse sequences. To accomplish this goal, this project will develop new machine learning algorithms for high-quality parameter mapping from free-breathing data. The first aim of this project will increase parameter map resolution achievable from highly accelerated, noisy data. The proposed method will integrate existing deep cascade network-based image reconstructions with convolutional network-based blocks for super-resolution and parameter map estimation. Preliminary studies suggest these new blocks improve sharpness and mitigate artifacts in the reconstructed parameter maps. The next aim will improve the training precision of such artificial neural networks to account for the significant per-voxel nonlinear fit variability in quantitative MRI. The proposed method will reweight the loss function used for calibrating these networks by the goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination) of the reference maps obtained from fully sampled training data. Preliminary results demonstrate that quality-aware reweighting significantly improves reconstructed image quality when working with noisy training data. Experiments will evaluate the precision of both of these innovations against existing deep-learning-based reconstructions on T1 maps obtained from pre- and post-contrast cardiac images of volunteer patients. The final aim will address motion during the acquisition by estimating and tracking nonrigid motion in the data consistency stages of the deep cascade artificial neural network architecture. Two methods are proposed: deformable motion estimation already demonstrated on compressive model-based image reconstructions, and a new “re-blurring” convolutional neural network that automatically introduces artifacts into a “clean” image to match the motion-corrupted data. Both of these methods enforce consistency between motion-affected data and a motion-free image during the reconstruction. Both methods will be validated on both cardiac and abdominal images for motion artifacts and reconstruction quality against breath-held parameter mapping acquisitions. Project Narrative Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging noninvasively measures physical properties of tissue connected to cardiovascular disease and many other conditions. Novel machine learning methods for processing data to produce higher quality maps will facilitate earlier and more accurate treatment of these diseases. This project will facilitate rapid quantitative imaging with freely breathing subjects.",Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI,10007241,R56EB028254,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Balance training', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fibrosis', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardium', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Weight', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'coronary fibrosis', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motion sensitivity', 'multitask', 'neural network architecture', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'physical property', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R56,2019,347527,0.00636468892162712
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9788239,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,562232,0.04183127880964487
"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,9825278,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2019,209851,0.05988606403056793
"Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc- tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi- ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol- ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam- ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo- rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us- ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti- cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in- clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova- tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol- umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo- rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi- channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO). PROJECT NARRATIVE Composition and organization of cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) they are embedded in, controls the function of different organs in human body. Alterations in any of these can lead to onset and progression of var- ious diseases. The proposed project will develop image analytics algorithms and open source software for high- resolution 3-D mapping of skin, the largest organ in the human body, and evaluate molecular and architectural changes due to aging and UV exposure.",Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues,9893208,UH3CA246594,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multiomic Data', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organ Model', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Aging', 'Skin Tissue', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'analysis pipeline', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'multiplexed\xa0imaging', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sample collection', 'single cell analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tomography', 'tool']",NCI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,UH3,2019,587413,0.0667355718687512
"High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure Project Summary The overall objective of this research project is to develop a novel approach for high throughput screening of individual cells based on holographic imaging. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement a new quantitative phase imaging modality, holographic cytomtery, which incorporates several novel technical advances to enable high throughput imaging. Holographic cytometry (HC) will bring the high sensitivity of quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) to imaging of cells flowing through microfluidic devices. While QPM has been used for cell analysis previously, typically only a handful of cells have been imaged. To enable significant application of QPM for fundamental cell biology and clinical studies, it is necessary to move to a high throughput implementation. Technical advances needed to realize the high resolution HC system include use of high speed line scan cameras, microfluidic chips with multiple parallel channels, and light from a pulsed laser source to enable stroboscopic illumination. In order to efficiently analyze and process this data set, rapid analysis software will be developed that leverages the highly parallel processing capabilities of graphics processing units and machine learning algorithms to enable automated classification. The proposed HC method can be applied to imaging a wide range of flowing cells. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we will initially target the measurement of cancerous progression due to environmental toxicant exposure. We have conducted a preliminary study that shows QPM can detect early changes in the biomechanical properties of cells due to arsenic exposure. In the proposed project, we seek to develop QPM based biomarkers of pre-cancerous change that will enable rapid assessesment. QPM has not been implemented in such a format to date and thus is not yet a feasible approach for clinical or research studies. To meet the goal of high throughput imaging with QPM, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop new instrumentation for high speed imaging using off axis digital holography. 2. Implement high throughput analysis methods based on machine learning 3. Test and validate high throughput system with pilot studies of heavy metal exposed epithelial cells to show the approach can detect early pre-cancerous changes due to environmental toxicant exposure. Upon completion of this project, we will have realized a high throughput imaging cytometry system for research and clinical applications. Project Narrative  The proposed research will develop a new high throughput cellular screening technology based on quantitative phase image of cells flowing in a microfluidic chip. This technology will allow researchers and doctors to obtain holographic images of every single cell in a sample in a short amount of time which can then be analyzed by a computer. This would offer the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of populations of cells for understanding changes in public health due to environmental factors.",High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure,9732537,R21ES029791,"['Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cancerous', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Individual', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Metal exposure', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population Characteristics', 'Premalignant', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'carcinogenesis', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'detector', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'mechanical properties', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'parallel processing', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'systems research', 'tool', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,194177,0.004188463270236497
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func- tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in support of data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen- sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across the human body along multiple functional contexts (e.g., systems physiology, vascular, or endocrine systems), and connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources as driven by the context or “position” on the map. The CCF and the interactive data visualizations will be multi-level and multi-scale sup- porting the exploration and communication of tissue and publication data--from single cell to whole body. In the first year, the proposed Mapping Component will run user needs analyses, compile an initial CCF using pre-existing classifications and ontologies; implement two interactive data visualizations; and evaluate the usa- bility and effectiveness of the CCF and associated visualizations in formal user studies. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an ex- tensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spa- tial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high- resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets",9988039,OT2OD026671,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biometry', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Endocrine system', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Vascular System', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'interoperability', 'member', 'systematic review', 'usability', 'vector']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2019,49496,0.013328321696834561
"Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy Project Summary/Abstract “Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy” Positioning of cells in tissues is intimately linked to major cellular- and organ-level processes. Appropriate localization promotes exposure of cells to specific microenvironments and stimuli that define their differentiation states and functions. Cellular positioning also determines local tissue microanatomy, as well as the global macro-architecture, allowing for proper organ function and physiology. Thus, understanding the links among cellular positioning, heterogeneity and global tissue architecture are critical for biomedical research. However, current tools for understanding such relationships are limiting. Here, we will develop novel approaches to study cells using currently existing high-content tools, but importantly while also retaining information on the precise positioning of cells within tissues (Aim 1). This will allow us to interrogate how cellular heterogeneity and function is influenced by the exposure to distinct tissue microenvironments and localized stimuli. Further, we will generate novel computational approaches to understand how cellular positioning defines global tissue architecture (Aim 2). For this, we will develop a robust analytical methodology based on machine learning algorithms to study how complex patterns of cellular spatial positioning influences tissue organization and structure. These approaches will be broadly applicable across diverse disciplines of biology for both murine and human (or other species) studies, and will be highly pertinent in clinical settings, such as for cancer diagnostics. In summary, the proposed studies are significant, as they will provide a new toolbox for studying cellular and organ physiology based on cellular tissue positioning, as well as will lead to the development of new diagnostic tools for clinical medicine. Project narrative / Relevance statement The positioning of cells in tissues is critical for shaping both the cellular identity and function, as well as the structure and physiology of the entire organ. The proposed research will generate a novel, comprehensive toolbox for interrogating the relationships among cellular spatial positioning, cell heterogeneity, as well as tissue architecture. These tools will be relevant to public health because they will promote a better fundamental understanding of cellular and organ physiology, and because the developed tools will be directly applicable to the clinic, such as for pathology and diagnostic medicine.",Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy,9647827,R21AI142667,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Label', 'Link', 'Location', 'Lymphoid', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microanatomy', 'Molecular', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Neighborhoods', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'fluorophore', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'imaging approach', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'patient stratification', 'protein expression', 'spatial relationship', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2019,264500,0.016478684099807614
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"In vivo Imaging of Neuroactivity in the Deep Forward Scattering Regime Using Speckle Identification and Demixing (SPID) Microscopy PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain at depth and at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a key challenge in neuroscience. This is because tissue scattering eliminates directional information carried by photons, with a characteristic length scale of hundreds of microns. As a result, the remaining unscattered, or “ballistic” component of light decays exponentially with depth. Since all optical microscopy modalities rely—either in the excitation or the emission—on this ballistic component of light for image formation, the limitations imposed by scattering limit the maximally obtainable imaging depths to ~1.5 mm in the rodent brain. Hereby, we propose a systematic approach for exploring and developing a new platform for in vivo deep tissue calcium imaging that actively exploits the scattering properties of the tissue as a resource to localize, demix and extract neuronal activity traces in the millimeter depth range in the highly scattering rodent brain. Our approach utilizes the fact that the scattering process results in an accumulation of different relative phases between scattered light components, leading to the formation of deterministic but complex interference patterns known as speckles. Emission from different locations of the sample results in speckles with different intensity distributions. Thus, these patterns carry complex information about both the location of the emitter and the properties of the scattering medium. Our current results show that the obtainable contrast for these speckle patterns should be sufficient to identify, localize and demix them even for extended objects and with partially coherent light. We will design and build an array of hardware and computational tools that will allow us to systematically explore the limits within which such demixing and neuronal signal extraction can be achieved in vivo. We will use these insights and develop an optical platform for volumetric calcium imaging in the mouse brain in the deep forward-scattering regime, as well as for transcranial calcium imaging in the mouse brain. Our approach will synergistically combine the expertise on the physics of light propagation in disordered media in the Gigan Lab with the experience in machine learning, computational imaging and in vivo high-speed volumetric neuronal recording in the Vaziri Lab. Our method has the potential of opening up a new paradigm for neuronal imagining and signal extraction in the multiple scattering regime by enabling millimeter-range calcium imaging in the highly scattering rodent brain. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical recording of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain at depth with high spatial resolution remains, due to the highly scattering properties of brain tissue, a key challenge in neuroscience. This is because all microscopy modalities rely on the non-scattered ballistic component of light—which is exponentially attenuated with tissue depth—either in the excitation or the emission for image formation. We will overcome this issue by developing a deep-tissue calcium imaging platform that exploits the scattering properties of the tissue to localize, demix and extract neuronal activity traces in the millimeter range in the highly scattering rodent brain.",In vivo Imaging of Neuroactivity in the Deep Forward Scattering Regime Using Speckle Identification and Demixing (SPID) Microscopy,9828367,RF1NS113251,"['Algorithms', 'Attenuated', 'Ballistics', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Snakes', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'attenuation', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'computerized tools', 'cranium', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'in vivo imaging', 'insight', 'light scattering', 'method development', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal cell body', 'neurotransmission', 'optical imaging', 'practical application', 'temporal measurement', 'two photon microscopy']",NINDS,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,RF1,2019,1549615,0.013889504345791413
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9792960,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2019,667280,0.07718559224782535
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,9684263,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'progenitor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,485405,0.009758777559097199
"I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia. 1. Executive Summary Nearly 150,000 patients in the US undergo lower extremity amputations annually secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) complicated by critical limb ischemia (CLI).1,2,3 To increase a patient’s post-operative quality of life, surgeons attempt to salvage as much limb tissue as possible while also considering the likelihood of primary wound healing at a given level of amputation (LOA).4 The principal challenge in this decision is that surgeons overestimate the likelihood of healing at the selected LOA. Therefore, in the first year, 10% to 35% of amputations eventually require re-amputation to a more proximal level.5-7 This additional treatment prolongs the patient’s return to walking, worsening their condition and deteriorating their mental health. The burden to the healthcare system is immense. The average cost for each amputation is over $70,000, as evidenced by a recent publication that shows diabetic foot ulcer complications, mainly attributed to amputation, cost more than the five most costly forms of cancer.8 Despite these facts, there are no objective studies for selection of LOA in patients with PAD. To address this critical problem, Spectral MD (SMD) has developed a point-of-care imaging device (DeepView), which simultaneously performs multispectral imaging (MSI) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) imaging across the visible and infrared spectrum to obtain a quantitative microvascular tissue assessment. These optical measurements are integrated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide a quantitative aid to the physician’s determination of tissue viability at a proposed amputation site. If used for routine assessment prior to amputation, SMD expects DeepView to reduce the rate of re- amputation by 70%, resulting in up to 38,000 fewer re-amputations per year while improving quality of life for amputees and reducing associated health costs. The central objective for SMD’s Phase I SBIR is to perform a feasibility clinical study to demonstrate the DeepView device will achieve greater than 90% accuracy in identifying the healing potential of tissue at the amputation site. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Complete a Feasibility Study creating a database of pre-amputation images. This data will be used for construction of the AI algorithm to predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 2: Identify MSI and PPG features that can accurately predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 3: Using Aim I clinical data, finalize the AI algorithm architecture and estimate sample size needed for a Phase II Pivotal Study in which the necessary training data to achieve at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity will be obtained. As of this Supplement request, SMD has initiated a clinical study for feasibility and enrolled the first subject. Through collaboration with the clinical study site Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Dennis Gable, SMD developed the protocol and trained his research staff at the study site, Baylor Medical Center Plano, in the use of the DeepView device. SMD anticipates enrollment of five subjects each month over the next 6 months. The I-Corps team will consist of the following members: Michael DiMaio, MD – Role: C-Level Corporate Officer. Dr. DiMaio, MD is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SMD and has led SMD in obtaining over $30M in non-dilutive government funding and private investments. His distinguished career includes extensive experience as an entrepreneur, clinician, and scientist. With over 20 years’ experience as a cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. DiMaio has a widespread network of physicians and hospitals from which to draw contacts for customer interviews. Jeffrey Thatcher, PhD – Role: PI. Dr. Thatcher is the Chief Scientist at SMD and is a leader in the development of diagnostic imaging for soft tissue diseases. He led SMD in conceptualizing and inventing SMD’s core imaging technology undergoing clinical trials in three wound diagnostics applications including: burns; diabetic ulcers; and amputation. Wensheng Fan, MS – Role: Industry Expert. Wensheng Fan is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at SMD. He is an executive, entrepreneur, and innovator with over 20 years of experience in natural speech recognition and real time imaging systems. At SMD, he leads market engagement, strategic financial planning, and device development. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia.,9827388,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Burn injury', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic ulcer', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Innovation Corps', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Principal Investigator', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'S Phase', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Soft Tissue Disorder', 'Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Wound Healing', 'career', 'cost', 'experience', 'foot', 'healing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'point of care', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'speech recognition', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2019,54976,0.009585999142172803
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution.

"New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens Project Summary Over 600,000 bone marrow biopsies are performed every year in the United States, while hundreds of thousands more lymph node biospies are performed. Histological evaluation of these biopsies is a critical component of care for hematologic diseases including leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disease and non-neoplastic conditions such as viral infections and autoimmune conditions.  We have developed a platform that we consider a paradigm shift in the histologic examination of tissues. It is based on a new chemical process, imaging, and image processing approach that we have dubbed Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton microscopy (CHiMP).The CHiMP technology enables visual analysis of entire intact, un-embedded and uncut specimens within a short time-frame and with a resolution that is amenable to primary diagnosis. The significant clinical benefits include: 1) potential for same-day diagnosis, 2) labor and cost savings, 3) access to 3D perspective, 4) increased visual data from same specimen, 5) complete tissue preservation for ancillary studies such as DNA analysis and 6) inherent benefits of digital data such as reduced risk of loss, ready remote review by experts, and amenability to machine learning tools. Hematopoietic tissue evaluation would similarly benefit from these advantages, but unfortunately the systems developed thus far lack the resolution typically needed for visual examination of hematopoietic tissues.  For this Phase I SBIR proposal, an objective is to develop customized optics to improve the resolution of our current microscopes and thereby enable use in the specialized field of hematology. Commercially available objective lenses that are compatible with our immersion medium are either limited to numerical apertures (NA) that are less than one, affecting resolution and image quality, or have insufficient working distances for imaging past the coverslip and surface roughness to obtain complete sections. We will design and test a custom objective lens with high NA and long working distance, suited for our proprietary reagents. Integrating such a lens into our microscope will also require the design of a custom scan lens, custom beam conditioning optics, and a custom polygon scanner.  An associated goal is to develop a novel approach to preparing bone marrow aspiration specimens that will make them amenable to imaging with CHiMP, potentially reducing the need for core biopsies by permitting unambiguous morphologic categorization of cell subtypes in their architectural context, without the routine need for immunohistochemistry, and while preserving nucleic acids for molecular/genetic evaluation. Project Narrative Applikate Technologies has developed a powerful platform for histological evaluation of tissue called Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton Microscopy, or CHiMP. This platform has many advantages over traditional approaches, including same-day turn-around, reduced labor costs, preservation of tissue for DNA analysis, and direct-to-digital imaging for ease of consultation with remote experts. This proposal seeks to develop custom optics to enable very-high-resolution imaging of bone marrow and lymph node samples that are critical for diagnosing diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma.","New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens",9677952,R43CA235890,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Ancillary Study', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Aspiration', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Decalcification', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hematopathology', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Optics', 'Pan Genus', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'hematopoietic tissue', 'high resolution imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lens', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'medical specialties', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'preservation', 'second harmonic', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,"APPLIKATE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2019,224713,0.06396902450917963
"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9636557,R21DC016047,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computational basis', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'multidimensional data', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2019,210725,-0.04922881223733456
"A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images Abstract  The ability of accurate localize and characterize cells in light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) image is indispensable for shedding new light on the understanding of three dimensional structures of the whole brain. In our previous work, we have successfully developed a 2D nuclear segmentation method for the nuclear cleared microscopy images using deep learning techniques. Although the convolutional neural networks show promise in segmenting cells in LSFM images, our previous work is confined in 2D segmentation scenario and suffers from the limited number of annotated data. In this project, we aim to develop a high throughput 3D cell segmentation engine, with the focus on improving the segmentation accuracy and generality. First, we will develop a cloud based semi-automatic annotation platform using the strength of virtual reality (VR) and crowd sourcing. The user-friendly annotation environment and stereoscopic view in VR can significantly improve the efficiency of manual annotation. We design a semi-automatic annotation workflow to largely reduce human intervention, and thus improve both the accuracy and the replicability of annotation across different users. Enlightened by the spirit of citizen science, we will extend the annotation software into a crowd sourcing platform which allows us to obtain a massive number of manual annotations in short time. Second, we will develop a fully 3D cell segmentation engine using 3D convolutional neural networks trained with the 3D annotated samples. Since it is often difficult to acquire isotropic LSFM images, we will further develop a super resolution method to impute a high resolution image to facilitate the 3D cell segmentation. Third, we will develop a transfer learning framework to make our 3D cell segmentation engine general enough to the application of novel LSFM data which might have significant gap of image appearance due to different imaging setup or clearing/staining protocol. This general framework will allow us to rapidly develop a specific cell segmentation solution for new LSFM data with very few or even no manual annotations, by transferring the existing 3D segmentation engine that has been trained with a sufficient number of annotated samples. Fourth, we will apply our computational tools to several pilot neuroscience studies: (1) Investigating how topoisomerase I (one of the autism linked transcriptional regulators) regulates brain structure, and (2) Investigating genetic influence on cell types in the developing human brain by quantifying the number of progenitor cells in fetal cortical tissue. Successful carrying out our project will have wide-reaching impact in neuroscience community in visualizing and analyzing complete cellular resolution maps of individual cell types within healthy and disease brain. The improved cell segmentation engine in 3D allows scientists from all over the world to share and process each other’s data accurately and efficiently, thus increasing reproducibility and power. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a next generation cell segmentation engine for the whole brain tissue cleared images. Our proposed work is built upon our previous 2D nuclear segmentation project using deep learning techniques. However, we found that our current computational tool is limited in 2D segmentation scenario and insufficient of annotated training samples. To address these limitations, we will first develop a cloud-based semi-automatic annotation tool with the capacity of virtual reality. Our annotation tool is designed to be cross- platform, which allows us to partner with “SciStarter” (the largest citizen science projects in the world) and acquire large amount of cell annotations from the science enthusiastic volunteers. Meanwhile, we will develop next generation 3D cell segmentation engine using an end-to-end fully connected convolution neural network. To facilitate 3D cell segmentation, we will also develop a super resolution method to impute an isotropic high- resolution image from a low-resolution microscopy image. After the development of 3D cell segmentation engine, we will continue to improve its generality by developing a transfer learning framework which enables us to rapidly deploy our 3D cell segmentation engine to the novel microscopy images without the time-consuming manual annotation step. Finally, we will apply our segmentation tool to visualize and quantify brain structure differences within genetically characterized mouse and human brain tissue at UNC neuroscience center. In the end of this project, we will release the software (both binary program and source code) and the 3D cell annotations, in order to facilitate the similar neuroscience studies in other institutes. Considering the importance of high throughput computational tools in quantifying three dimensional brain structure, this cutting- edge technique will be very useful in neuroscience research community.",A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images,9714223,R01NS110791,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anecdotes', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source Code', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Type I DNA Topoisomerases', 'Visual', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fetal', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'stereoscopic', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality', 'volunteer']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,335573,0.010815496441333445
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9669022,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569563,0.032334485341037215
"VISUALIZATION OF SUBCELLULAR DYNAMICS IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS Abstract Contemporary fluorescence microscopy connects our understanding of molecular events from biochemistry and structural biology with their activities in living cells. Lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM) has made it possible for us to track phenomena such as endocytic vesicle assembly or lipid kinase recruitment across an entire cell with high resolution, in both space and time, and with nearly single-molecule sensitivity. Development during the past year of lattice light sheet microscopy with adaptive optics (AO-LLSM) has overcome the optical limitations that have so far restricted most studies to individual cells in culture, allowing us to achieve comparable resolution and sensitivity in the complex optical environment of an intact, living, multicellular organism. It promises to bridge the gap between cells and organisms, through high sensitivity, volumetric imaging, with diffraction-limited resolution, of living tissues and developing embryos. We propose a research program in three overlapping stages: implementation of AO-LLSM (in collaboration with its developer), development of the new kinds of visualization and analysis software required by the scale and complexity of the datasets, and use of AO-LLSM to solve a problem in vertebrate development. To meet the computational challenges of analyzing the 4D data sets (from low signal-to-noise, the often non- punctate characteristics of the objects being studied, the temporally varying spatial complexity of the data, and the size of the data sets), we will develop new approaches using deep learning and related algorithms, with consultation from experts. As a paradigm application, we will study the consequences of Notch signaling and the related membrane-traffic and protein translocation events for cell differentiation in zebrafish early neurogenesis. AO-LLSM will for the first time allow us to relate molecular signaling events occurring on a timescale of seconds at cell interfaces to the ultimate fate of daughter cells many hours later.

"Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging methods are well-established in neuroscience, but high-speed, high- resolution volumetric imaging of neural activity in deep tissue remains a challenge. A number of techniques address limited aspects of this goal, and most are applicable primarily to acute preparations. We propose to develop and test a novel approach to achieve three-dimensional “deep-tissue” imaging for high spatial and temporal resolution neural recording by combining aspects of embedded optical probes with computational imaging techniques. Rather than use a single micro-endoscopic probe, we propose to utilize an array of narrower probes, or optrodes, to reduce the volume of tissue displacement. Computational imaging through each probe can be performed to achieve a field of view (FOV) at a desired distance from the probe tip. Combining the fields of view from multiple probes arranged in an array then provides a composite image field that is much larger than achievable from a single micro-endoscope. In our approach, each ∼0.1 mm diameter probe of the array acts as an independent micro- endoscope. In order to achieve full-field imaging across the array, the individual fields must intersect, and the computational method must be scaled to accommodate, and stitch, multiple fields. In pursuit of these goals, we propose three Aims: Optimizing the FOV of a single micro-endoscope - The purpose of this Aim is to characterize the FOV for an individual probe at multiple depths, and optimize the FOV to about 0.3mm through control over the shape of the probe tip and light collection numerical aperture. Accelerating calibration and reconstruction - In this Aim, we will pursue efficient computational approaches for calibration based upon ray-tracing simulations and image reconstruction based on deep learning. Scaling the FOV with an endoscope array - The computational image reconstruction method will be scaled to accommodate small micro-endoscope arrays (e.g. 4 element) arranged in a hexagonal lattice with FOV of 0.6mm at a 1.5mm depth. NARRATIVE Imaging deep inside tissue, including the brain, is critical to understanding various biological processes. Doing so through a small probe is also of primary importance for minimizing tissue damage. In this proposal, we apply computational techniques to create fluorescent images using an array of microscopic glass needles to guide light in and out of a mouse brain. The simplicity and small footprint of our system have the potential for deep-brain imaging (depths > 1.5 mm) across a large (mm) field of view, which should enable a wide variety of biological and neuroscience studies in the future.",Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging,9829467,R21EY030717,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Coupled', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Endoscopes', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescent Probes', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Miniaturization', 'Mus', 'Needles', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Penetration', 'Preparation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'absorption', 'adaptive optics', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'lens', 'microendoscope', 'multi-photon', 'neural circuit', 'novel strategies', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal rods', 'simulation', 'temporal measurement']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,456800,0.04705598609088775
"Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging Project Summary In this project we want to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric  metabolic maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution. The key to this new technology is the novel combination of three state-of-the-art imaging concepts: (A) new hardware that enables the simultaneous  measurement of multinuclear magnetic resonance (MR) signals at different frequencies; (B) the flexibility and robustness of Plug-and-Play (PnP) MR Fingerprinting (MRF); and (C) a data fusion process driven by a cross-modality model based on statistical learning. For brevity, we will call this fused simultaneous multinuclear PnP-MRF technique MNF (Multi-Nuclear Fusion). The idea behind MNF is to rapidly capture two different kinds of quantitative  information throughout the whole brain in one single scan: (1) structural information from proton (1H) MRF such as T1, T2, and proton density (PD) (tissue-scale morphology); and (2) metabolic information related to ion  homeostasis from sodium (23Na) MRF, such as intracellular sodium concentration, and intracellular, extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume fractions (cellular-scale function). Because PnP-MRF can quantify multiple  tissue properties free of experimental bias, it enables us to employ statistical learning to discover a subject-specific cross-modality model that integrates all voxelwise inter-relationships between the multi-parametric 1H PnP-MRF (acquired at high resolution, 0.75-1 mm) and 23Na PnP-MRF (acquired at low resolution, 3-5 mm) maps. These subject-specific relations can subsequently be used to sharpen the 23Na metabolic maps to match the resolution of the 1H structural maps. The high-resolution 23Na maps will enable the assessment of metabolic processes in vivo and bridge the gap in resolution that has held back our ability to study metabolism in the living human brain, which is crucial for our understanding of the brain itself and the afflictions that affect it. This proof-of-concept implementation will be developed at 7 T, but it is expected to be adaptable to clinical 3 T MR scanners. The specific aims are: (1) Data acquisition, (1.a) multi-channel 1H/23Na RF array, (1.b) simultaneous multinuclear 3D MRF sequence; (2) Data processing, (2.a) PnP-MRF reconstruction for both 1H data (fingerprint matching to generate structural maps) and 23Na data (tissue 4-compartment model and simulation of spin 3/2 dynamics to generate metabolic maps), (2.b) cross-modality model using statistical learning, and data fusion algorithm to generate high-resolution metabolic maps; (3) Method validation, (3.a) accuracy and precision, (3.b) repeatability and reproducibility.(3) Exploratory aim: Test MNF on patients with chronic steno-occlusive disease, with  recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA)/minor stroke, presenting regional brain ischemia, at 3 time points (baseline, 8-month and 16-month follow-ups), and comparison with healthy controls. Project Narrative We propose to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric metabolic 3D maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution, based on the fusion of simultaneously acquired proton and sodium data with plug-and-play magnetic resonance fingerprinting. The fusion algorithm between high- resolution proton structural maps and low-resolution sodium metabolic maps will be based on a cross-modality model optimized with statistical learning methods, and will generate for the first time high-resolution metabolic maps related to ion homeostasis in the brain in vivo. These new fused high-resolution structural and metabolic maps will provide new insights into neuro-architecture, neuro-biochemistry and their interconnection, which are crucial for our understanding of the human brain and its disorders.",Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging,9731533,R01EB026456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biochemistry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracellular Fluid', 'Ions', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'hemodynamics', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'simulation']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,622031,0.03458278602599356
"Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing Project Summary Tissue stiffness varies along organs and tissue types, from very soft (e.g. brain) to intermediate (e.g. digestive organs) and to very stiff (e.g. bone). Sensing this stiffness by cells determines differentiation, proliferation, migration and survival, which are all important for development. Local tissue stiffening is a hallmark of cancer, sensing of which by cancer cells causes further tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding stiffness sensing mechanism is thus essential for designing appropriate treatment strategy against developmental disorders and cancer. The prominent “sensor” for mechanical stiffness of tissue environment is a molecular complex located between the cell and the environment, referred to as a focal adhesion. The first step in stiffness sensing is thought to involve transmission of increased level of a force across molecules in the focal adhesion against higher tissue stiffness, but the underlying biomechanical/molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The challenge in investigating this mechanism is in the dynamic nature of its structure, molecular interaction and mechanical forces affecting its assembly. The goal of this work is to understand whether, how and when the focal adhesion during dynamic assembly from their birth starts to be able to transmit the differential forces against varying tissue stiffness levels. Toward this goal, we have developed a set of experimental, microscopic and computational techniques to measure a small force from the adhesions, to profile heterogeneous dynamics of entire adhesion population, and to link molecular activity to force transmission in statistically confident manner. Specifically, we focus on a tiny dot-like complex called “a nascent adhesion”, an early form of the focal adhesion, and involvement of the mechanical linker protein talin, given its ability to be stretched and expose binding sites for other molecules like a vinculin, another mechanical linker protein. The overall objective of this proposal is to use these techniques to test a novel conceptual model of stiffness sensing in which nascent adhesions are sensitive to the tissue stiffness by talin-mediated transmission of force, which promotes further maturation of them to focal adhesions. We will determine if 1) nascent adhesions can transmits differential levels of force in response to varying ECM stiffness, 2) the main source of force actin cytoskeleton- driven and myosin-independent, 3) there is concurrent recruitment of talin and vinculin as a pre-assembled complex and whether it affects force-transmission in response to the ECM stiffness, and 4) competition for talin binding of talin-binding proteins against actin-binding decreases force transmission by nascent adhesion and impair the ECM stiffness sensing. An enhanced mechanistic understanding of these processes would increase our fundamental knowledge of how cells sense and respond to tissue mechanics. Thus, the proposed studies are relevant to the NIH's mission, as they will lead to new insights in physiology and pathophysiology including tissue development, regeneration and cancer progression. Project Narrative Cells’ ability to sense tissue stiffness has a fundamental impact on tissue development and disease progression such as cancer metastasis. The sensing takes place at the interface between the cells and the extracellular matrix via integrin-based adhesions, but our understanding has been limited to sensing by big, mature adhesions. This proposal seeks to test whether tiny, newly-born adhesions can sense tissue stiffness by accurate measurement of mechanical force transmitted through them and recruitment of early adhesion proteins.",Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing,9880640,R15GM135806,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomechanics', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chimera organism', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'F-Actin', 'Fluorescence', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Integrin Binding', 'Integrins', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organ', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Talin', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Traction\xa0Force Microscopy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vinculin', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer cell', 'cellular engineering', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'mechanical force', 'migration', 'novel', 'particle', 'polymerization', 'recruit', 'response', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'sensor', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor progression', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,414802,0.0134574233445065
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents.

"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of different types of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an ex- tensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spa- tial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical.

"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders.

"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target.

"A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain Project Summary  In this project, we propose to validate and characterize ﬁber orientation estimation from diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI) through the optimization of a multi-modality, multi-scale imaging pipeline for whole mouse brains. DTI is a powerful tool used to noninvasively report 3D microstructural properties of nervous tissue on a macroscopic scale, and has played an important role in the understanding and diagnosis of a number of neurological disease processes. Modern acquisitions of DTI data can be processed to generate a 3D diffusion proﬁle known as an orientation diffusion function (ODF) at each voxel. The ODF is used to infer the orientation of local axon ﬁber pop- ulations. Previous efforts to validate these orientation estimates have primarily relied on serial optical histology as a ground truth dataset. Histology-based pipelines involve the labor intensive task of physically sectioning the tissue into thin slices, leading to physical destruction of the sample and anisotropic resolution. These limitations potentially confound the accuracy of 3D orientation estimation, complicate the process of spatially registering the ground-truth and DTI datasets, and limit quantitative comparisons to select regions of interest (ROI) across the brain sample.  In recent years, synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for high-resolution tissue imaging. With a mosaic projection-stitching method, a whole mouse brain can be imaged at an isotropic, 3D resolution of 1.2 microns after prior imaging with DTI. To enhance microCT contrast, the tis- sue specimens are ﬁxed and stained with the same kind of metal-based stains used in electron microscopy (EM) prior to embedding in resin. We will optimize this microCT-EM validation pipeline to address the limitations of pre- vious histology-based studies, and characterize DTI algorithm performance across a whole mouse brain using micron- to nano-scale neurological information.  The speciﬁc aims of the proposal are: (1) model phase contrast to optimize microCT data acquisition, (2) vali- date DTI ODF reconstruction methods using ground-truth microCT (3) characterize DTI performance using under- lying tissue microstructure information from EM. Upon completion, aim 1 will generate a novel theoretical model and acquisition strategy to exploit microCT phase contrast in strongly absorbing biological samples. Aim 2 will generate a ground-truth dataset of ODFs across a whole mouse brain, which will be used to calculate algorithm- speciﬁc spatial maps of DTI performance. In Aim 3, around 20 ROI will be selected for nano-scale imaging with EM, and DTI performance will be characterized by quantitative features of the underlying neural architecture. These results will provide an unprecedented microstructure-driven understanding of the DTI signal, allowing fu- ture studies to develop more advanced DTI models and acquisition strategies to better leverage ﬁber orientation and connectivity information in the treatment of neurological disease. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to use synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography and serial electron microscopy to validate diffusion MRI reconstruction methods. This unprecedented pipeline allows for imaging the same tissue across scales ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers.

A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,9657003,R01DE027677,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,523782,-0.0077786674918657525
"Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY Marfan Syndrome (MFS), one of the most common heritable connective tissue disorders, affects 1 in 5,000 individuals and has destructive manifestations in multiple organ systems; notably the cardiovascular system. MFS is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a genetic mutation in the Fibrillin-1 gene leading to aberrant TGFβ signaling, and frequently results in aortic aneurysm, dissection, and death. Interestingly, the associated degeneration within the aortic vessel wall almost always occurs in the aortic root or ascending aorta and not in the descending or abdominal aorta; while this putatively reflects regional differences in hemodynamic stress, antihypertensive treatment alone is not effective in managing aortic aneurysm in MFS. Alternatively, it is also the case that aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), which predominate the vasoactive medial layer of the vessel wall, have heterogeneous subtypes stemming from distinct developmental germ-layers based on their anatomical location; Neuroectoderm (NE) origin gives rise to ascending ASMCs and Paraxial mesoderm (PM) origin gives rise to descending ASMCs. This project will use origin-specific ASMCs differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MFS and healthy controls to test a novel hypothesis that developmental origin causes location-specific abnormalities in ASMCs associated with medial degeneration in MFS. Additionally, it will explore for biomarkers of presymptomatic congenital defects in Marfan Syndrome to identify novel targets for prophylactic therapeutic intervention. These studies will characterize phenotypic differences in human ASMC subtypes at the cellular and tissue level with stem-cell culturing and vascular tissue engineering techniques. Using state-of-the-art core facilities we will also conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on these cellular and tissue models to cultivate a rich biological profile for bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, we will develop a bioinformatics pipeline to elucidate novel prophylactic targets inherently responsible for ascending aortic MFS-induced medial degeneration, using our uniquely combined phenotypic, transcriptomic, and proteomic results as input. Lastly, based on our bioinformatic outputs we will test our intervention on our human iPSC-based in vitro models and compare to treatment with Losartan, a commonly used anti-hypertensive drug that also exhibits unique anti-remodeling properties and has shown promise for managing the symptoms of MFS in animals and in patients. The training plan for this fellowship will focus on technical skills, experimental design and critical analysis, critique of published scientific data, and presentation skills. It will be achieved by regular mentor meetings, journal clubs, conference presentations, bi- annual committee meetings, and advanced coursework. The majority of training will occur in the Costa Lab at the Cardiovascular Research Center at ISMMS, a highly active and collaborative environment with available mentors and students aligned with my research topics and career goals. Additional training will occur in the Ramirez Lab with senior researchers in Marfan Syndrome and biochemical investigation techniques. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposes a bioengineering approach for investigating new human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based cellular and 3D tissue models of Marfan Syndrome (MFS), a rare connective tissue disorder that frequently causes aortic aneurysm and dissection specifically in the ascending aorta. Our findings will elucidate mechanobiological differences in aortic smooth muscle cells of distinct embryologic origin, and their underlying mechanisms of response to mechanical stimuli. This will help improve our understanding of aneurysm localization in MFS, and guide more effective therapies for MFS patients in the future.",Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome,9836422,F31HL149271,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Actins', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Core Facility', 'Critiques', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descending aorta', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'Fellowship', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Germ', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Losartan', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Neural Crest', 'Neuroectoderm', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paraxial Mesoderm', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scanning Probe Microscopes', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stem cells', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Students', 'Sudden Death', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Vascular remodeling', 'abdominal aorta', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'career', 'cell dimension', 'collaborative environment', 'confocal imaging', 'drug candidate', 'effective therapy', 'healthy volunteer', 'hemodynamics', 'heritable connective tissue disorder', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'lead candidate', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanotransduction', 'meetings', 'multidimensional data', 'nanoindentation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prophylactic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'regional difference', 'response', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'stem', 'symposium', 'symptom management', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'two-dimensional', 'vascular tissue engineering']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2019,44856,-0.00604969037578708
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9659850,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,593526,0.04183127880964487
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func- tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in support of data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen- sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across the human body along multiple functional contexts (e.g., systems physiology, vascular, or endocrine systems), and connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources as driven by the context or “position” on the map. The CCF and the interactive data visualizations will be multi-level and multi-scale sup- porting the exploration and communication of tissue and publication data--from single cell to whole body. In the first year, the proposed Mapping Component will run user needs analyses, compile an initial CCF using pre-existing classifications and ontologies; implement two interactive data visualizations; and evaluate the usa- bility and effectiveness of the CCF and associated visualizations in formal user studies. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an ex- tensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spa- tial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high- resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets",9687220,OT2OD026671,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biometry', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Endocrine system', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Vascular System', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'interoperability', 'member', 'systematic review', 'usability', 'vector']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2018,330000,0.013328321696834561
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure Project Summary The overall objective of this research project is to develop a novel approach for high throughput screening of individual cells based on holographic imaging. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement a new quantitative phase imaging modality, holographic cytomtery, which incorporates several novel technical advances to enable high throughput imaging. Holographic cytometry (HC) will bring the high sensitivity of quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) to imaging of cells flowing through microfluidic devices. While QPM has been used for cell analysis previously, typically only a handful of cells have been imaged. To enable significant application of QPM for fundamental cell biology and clinical studies, it is necessary to move to a high throughput implementation. Technical advances needed to realize the high resolution HC system include use of high speed line scan cameras, microfluidic chips with multiple parallel channels, and light from a pulsed laser source to enable stroboscopic illumination. In order to efficiently analyze and process this data set, rapid analysis software will be developed that leverages the highly parallel processing capabilities of graphics processing units and machine learning algorithms to enable automated classification. The proposed HC method can be applied to imaging a wide range of flowing cells. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we will initially target the measurement of cancerous progression due to environmental toxicant exposure. We have conducted a preliminary study that shows QPM can detect early changes in the biomechanical properties of cells due to arsenic exposure. In the proposed project, we seek to develop QPM based biomarkers of pre-cancerous change that will enable rapid assessesment. QPM has not been implemented in such a format to date and thus is not yet a feasible approach for clinical or research studies. To meet the goal of high throughput imaging with QPM, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop new instrumentation for high speed imaging using off axis digital holography. 2. Implement high throughput analysis methods based on machine learning 3. Test and validate high throughput system with pilot studies of heavy metal exposed epithelial cells to show the approach can detect early pre-cancerous changes due to environmental toxicant exposure. Upon completion of this project, we will have realized a high throughput imaging cytometry system for research and clinical applications. Project Narrative  The proposed research will develop a new high throughput cellular screening technology based on quantitative phase image of cells flowing in a microfluidic chip. This technology will allow researchers and doctors to obtain holographic images of every single cell in a sample in a short amount of time which can then be analyzed by a computer. This would offer the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of populations of cells for understanding changes in public health due to environmental factors.",High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure,9610235,R21ES029791,"['Algorithms', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Individual', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Metal exposure', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population Characteristics', 'Premalignant', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Vision', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'carcinogenesis', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'detector', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mechanical properties', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'parallel processing', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'systems research', 'tool', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,209312,0.004188463270236497
"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,9517061,R01GM062968,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Hydration status', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Motors', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plant Resins', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'data warehouse', 'density', 'design', 'fiber cell', 'fitness', 'fundamental research', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecular assembly', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,306284,0.030844174731666927
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,9549091,UG3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UG3,2018,1000,0.0486837708765289
"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9452335,R21DC016047,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2018,249441,-0.04922881223733456
"Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy NIH-R15 “Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy” Project Summary Fluorescence optical microscopy is one of the most important tools available for the study of biological systems at the cellular level. Unfortunately, due to diffraction phenomena the resolution of fluorescence microscopes in the lateral dimension is limited to about 250 nm. As many biological structures within cells are much smaller than this, increasing resolution is of prime importance. Although several methods are now available which are able to extend the resolution of optical microscopes beyond the diffraction limit, imaging live cells with these methods remains a major challenge. Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM), which can achieve a resolution of approximately 100 nm, is a suitable super-resolution method for imaging live cells. However, adoption of this technique by biologists is hindered by the inflexible equipment and artifact-prone image analysis algorithms which are currently available. The solution to this problem demands innovations in both optical design and in data processing methods which are used in SIM. Another new method, single molecule localization microscopy, achieves much higher resolution. Although live cell imaging has been demonstrated using single molecule localization approaches, applicability of this method in live cell studies is extremely limited due to the need to collect several thousand images to reconstruct a single super-resolution image. One solution to this problem is to greatly increase the density of photoactivated molecules in a given camera frame, but doing so requires more sophisticated computational methods to produce a satisfactory result. The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to develop, improve, and utilize super-resolution microscopy with a focus on imaging live cells. In Aim 1 we will develop alternative illumination approaches for SIM using economical components, and we will develop and implement improved SIM reconstruction algorithms which produce higher quality, more reliable results than are available with current methods. In Aim 2, we will improve single molecule localization microscopy, by developing and implementing algorithms for analysis of images with high densities of photoactivated molecules. Using the high density single molecule methods we develop, we expect to be able to accelerate imaging speed by a factor of 50, with a resulting image resolution of approximately 20 nm. In Aim 3, we will use the newly developed methods for studies of the molecular basis of allergic responses. We will use a novel total internal reflection-SIM microscope with polarized excitation to reveal the relationship between cell surface receptors and the morphology of the plasma membrane, in particular membrane regions with high curvature. NIH-R15: Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy Project Narrative Several methods are now available which are able to produce optical fluorescence microscopy images of cells with a resolution that is not limited by diffraction. These methods, known together as super-resolution microscopy, are limited in their capabilities and applications when imaging live cells. This interdisciplinary AREA project, submitted by a team of three investigators, will involve undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs in improving live cell imaging with super-resolution microscopy techniques. We will use the improved methods for studies of the molecular basis of allergic responses, which affect more than 50 million Americans each year.",Imaging Live Cells with Super-Resolution Microscopy,9515507,R15GM128166,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Award', 'Basophilic leukemia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Colorado', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'HELLS gene', 'IgE Receptors', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Lateral', 'Lighting', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nobel Prize', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Physics', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'allergic response', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence microscope', 'graduate student', 'imaging detector', 'imaging modality', 'immunological synapse formation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'live cell imaging', 'microscopic imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'overexpression', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R15,2018,432000,0.04084744500047706
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9524416,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,598063,0.032334485341037215
"Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 Digital Whole Slide Scanner Project Summary/Abstract This application is for a shared instrumentation grant from the Light Microscope Imaging Facility at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) School of Medicine (SOM) to acquire a fully automated, high-capacity, high- resolution Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 slide scanner that can accommodate both brightfield and fluorescence imaging in single-slide and double-slide formats. We also request MicroDimensions 3D reconstruction and alignment software packages for manipulating and analyzing the whole slide images produced with the scanner. We need to replace a scanner that is not functioning properly. Our well-established shared core facility supports NIH-funded investigators by giving them access to state-of-the-art microscopy technologies that enhance collaborative, multidisciplinary research. Acquisition of this instrument will have a high impact on the biomedical research at CWRU and expand the scope of our NIH-funded projects. Several projects have been identified that will utilize the scanner and its associated analyses programs. These include: the genetic mechanisms underlying skin fibrosis and cranial bone development (Atit); the mechanisms behind the lifelong functions of transcription factors in axonal growth and architecture (Deneris); deep-learning for histologic image predictors of various diseases (Madabhushi); the development of diagnostic probes to discriminate between glioma subtypes for screening and survival therapies (Brady-Kalnay); the role of progesterone receptors in the control of parturition and the development of therapies to prevent preterm birth (Messiano); the mechanisms by which breast cancer stem cells overcome metastatic latency leading to disease recurrence and the biomarkers that could potentially identify those tumors likely to undergo this process (Schiemann); and the significance of cholesterol-related proteins in brain and retinal function (Pikuleva). Many additional projects of minor users and others at CWRU are anticipated. All of the proposed projects are in need of a high-capacity automated scanner acquiring whole slide images so that analyses can be applied to tissues that cover hundreds of fields of view, rather than the single regions of interest that can be acquired on a standard microscope. Narrative This proposal seeks to acquire a new, state-of-the-art high-speed, high content digital slide scanner for high resolution cellular and biomarker identfcation across large tissue areas. The dual mode (fluorescence and brightfield) allows flexibility in marker visualization while the software allows the automated alignment of whole slide images for multi-stain analysis and 3d reconstruction of serial section for in-depth analysis of specimens.

"Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging Project Summary In this project we want to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric  metabolic maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution. The key to this new technology is the novel combination of three state-of-the-art imaging concepts: (A) new hardware that enables the simultaneous  measurement of multinuclear magnetic resonance (MR) signals at different frequencies; (B) the flexibility and robustness of Plug-and-Play (PnP) MR Fingerprinting (MRF); and (C) a data fusion process driven by a cross-modality model based on statistical learning. For brevity, we will call this fused simultaneous multinuclear PnP-MRF technique MNF (Multi-Nuclear Fusion). The idea behind MNF is to rapidly capture two different kinds of quantitative  information throughout the whole brain in one single scan: (1) structural information from proton (1H) MRF such as T1, T2, and proton density (PD) (tissue-scale morphology); and (2) metabolic information related to ion  homeostasis from sodium (23Na) MRF, such as intracellular sodium concentration, and intracellular, extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume fractions (cellular-scale function). Because PnP-MRF can quantify multiple  tissue properties free of experimental bias, it enables us to employ statistical learning to discover a subject-specific cross-modality model that integrates all voxelwise inter-relationships between the multi-parametric 1H PnP-MRF (acquired at high resolution, 0.75-1 mm) and 23Na PnP-MRF (acquired at low resolution, 3-5 mm) maps. These subject-specific relations can subsequently be used to sharpen the 23Na metabolic maps to match the resolution of the 1H structural maps. The high-resolution 23Na maps will enable the assessment of metabolic processes in vivo and bridge the gap in resolution that has held back our ability to study metabolism in the living human brain, which is crucial for our understanding of the brain itself and the afflictions that affect it. This proof-of-concept implementation will be developed at 7 T, but it is expected to be adaptable to clinical 3 T MR scanners. The specific aims are: (1) Data acquisition, (1.a) multi-channel 1H/23Na RF array, (1.b) simultaneous multinuclear 3D MRF sequence; (2) Data processing, (2.a) PnP-MRF reconstruction for both 1H data (fingerprint matching to generate structural maps) and 23Na data (tissue 4-compartment model and simulation of spin 3/2 dynamics to generate metabolic maps), (2.b) cross-modality model using statistical learning, and data fusion algorithm to generate high-resolution metabolic maps; (3) Method validation, (3.a) accuracy and precision, (3.b) repeatability and reproducibility.(3) Exploratory aim: Test MNF on patients with chronic steno-occlusive disease, with  recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA)/minor stroke, presenting regional brain ischemia, at 3 time points (baseline, 8-month and 16-month follow-ups), and comparison with healthy controls. Project Narrative We propose to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric metabolic 3D maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution, based on the fusion of simultaneously acquired proton and sodium data with plug-and-play magnetic resonance fingerprinting. The fusion algorithm between high- resolution proton structural maps and low-resolution sodium metabolic maps will be based on a cross-modality model optimized with statistical learning methods, and will generate for the first time high-resolution metabolic maps related to ion homeostasis in the brain in vivo. These new fused high-resolution structural and metabolic maps will provide new insights into neuro-architecture, neuro-biochemistry and their interconnection, which are crucial for our understanding of the human brain and its disorders.",Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging,9574362,R01EB026456,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biochemistry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracellular Fluid', 'Ions', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'hemodynamics', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'prototype', 'radiofrequency', 'reconstruction', 'simulation']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,685473,0.03458278602599356
"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,9609312,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'immunomodulatory drugs', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,69586,0.013806905443031385

"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,9496083,R01DE027677,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2018,533846,-0.0077786674918657525
"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9385425,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,220062,0.02384608920951702
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,9401936,UG3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UG3,2017,1000,0.0486837708765289

"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber. We propose to develop this into an ultraminiaturized microendoscope for functional brain imaging with minimal surgical damage in freely moving behaving animals.",Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals,9137657,R21EY026310,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Microscope', 'Miniaturization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Penetration', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imprint', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lens', 'microscopic imaging', 'miniaturize', 'minimally invasive', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'portability', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'targeted imaging', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NEI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2016,246750,0.03583797290311575
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,9119020,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Polynomial Models', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2016,222652,0.00977218725200438
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed collaborative project will investigate fundamental processes driving chordate embryogenesis. The project will combine the skills and expertise of two research groups: one that works in the area of developmental biology, and the other in the area of image analysis and computer vision. The goal of the project is take a whole-embryo embryo approach to investigating morphogenesis in live embryos in all 4 dimensions (x,y, z and t). Specifically, we will collect and analyze confocal microscopy images to derive quantitative data on the division, shape, volume and movements of all cells in both selected developing organs and in whole embryos. This project presents many challenges in sample selection and labeling, image capture, and image analysis and visualization. Most model organisms are fundamentally unsuited to the challenge of capturing the shape and movement of every cell in an entire tissue. Those that are suitable typically are distantly related to the chordates, and thus lack organs and tissues relevant to human health and disease. The ascidians (sea squirts), however, are close relatives of the vertebrates that combine a chordate body plan with a small and simple embryonic architecture suitable for imaging in toto. The data to be collected in such observations, particularly at the high resolution needed to observe cellular behavior, will be enormous. The extraction of large-scale quantitative information from timelapse image sets poses substantial challenges in terms of image segmentation and analysis. We have already made significant progress in segmenting 3D ascidian images and further refinements of these approaches are proposed here. The segmented data will allow the quantitative analysis of many complex cell behaviors, including the fundamental changes in cell shape and motility driving gastrulation, neurulation and convergent extension. These analyses will lead to specific hypotheses regarding the cellular and molecular machinery driving morphogenesis. To further investigate the molecular basis for these cellular phenomena, we will also extend our imaging and analysis efforts to investigate the dynamic patterns of subcellular localization of several proteins with key roles in morphogenesis. Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated. The project proposed here will combine the efforts of developmental biologists and computer engineers to capture and analyze images from live embryos with the goal of understanding cell behaviors in forming organs.",Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate,9094655,R01HD059217,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Organ', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell division', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroporation', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Movement', 'Myosin Light Chains', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plasmids', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Seeds', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'ascidian', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blastomere structure', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'convergent extension', 'developmental genetics', 'gastrulation', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging informatics', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'moesin', 'professor', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein distribution', 'segmentation Image analysis', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue repair']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2016,322717,0.01582289454714157
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training.

"Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract: Advances in imaging technology offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to various large-scale imaging studies, i.e., ADNI, for discovering AD-related imaging biomarkers. In these imaging studies, image registration plays a key role in reducing the confounding inter-subject variability and also enhancing the statistical power of identifying abnormalities related to AD. However, automated processing of large-scale imaging data, i.e., involving anything from hundreds to thousands of 3D brain images, is not trivial and requires dedicated computational tools. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going large-scale imaging study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration method will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch. Our key idea is to break down the complex groupwise registration problem into hierarchical sets of small- scale registration tasks that can be solved easily, thus making the large-scale registration more manageable and fast. Specifically, 1) for fast initialization of large-scale groupwise registration of brain images, we will develop in Aim 1 a hierarchical learning-based landmark detection algorithm, based on random forest regression, to detect salient anatomical landmarks and then jointly align all images with detected landmarks. Since all images are distributed in a complex manifold and also the registration of similar images is much faster and more accurate, we propose to first build a graph to link each image only with similar images, and then formulate groupwise registration as dynamic graph shrinkage. This avoids direct registration of each image to the group-mean image as done in the conventional methods, thus improving both speed and accuracy. 2) To significantly speed up and also improve this single-layer graph-based groupwise registration, we will further develop in Aim 2 a deep multi-layer groupwise registration by simultaneous layer-by-layer graph construction and layer-wise registration. 3) Finally, to significantly increase both the speed and accuracy of registration for new images acquired from on-going large-scale imaging study, we will develop in Aim 3 a novel incremental groupwise registration method to reuse previous registration results of existing images for guiding registration of new images. Specifically, each new image can be quickly registered to the common space of existing images by finding its most similar existing image(s). Accordingly, all new and existing images will become similar in the common space and then can be quickly updated for their overall groupwise registration. All computational tools developed will be made freely available to the research community, for accelerating the imaging study of Alzheimer's disease. Narrative Description of Project Modern imaging techniques offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to increasing number of large-scale imaging studies, including ADNI. However, the overwhelmingly big data poses new challenges to researchers in automated data processing. Thus, modern computational tools are expected to be able to handle the vast amount of data within a manageable time frame. In light of this, we aim to solve this large-scale spatial registration problem – a critical step directly related to accuracy and precision of imaging biomarkers to be discovered for AD. In particular, we will develop novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch.

"Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by unrelenting scarring and stiffening of the lungs that leads to the death of an estimated 34,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Unfortunately, individuals with IPF have extremely limited treatment options, as no effective drugs have been identified to halt the progression of fibrosis. Despite the importance of collagens to the structural organization both normal and remodeled ECM, little is known about how collagen structure in IPF differs from that of normal tissue architecture. There is a clear need to develop highly specific/sensitive techniques to probe collagen structure and organization in IPF tissues. In this project we will implement new collagen specific analyses using the high resolution microscopy technique of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). This method is sensitive to both the fibrillar organization and also sub-resolution aspects of macro and supramolecular assembly. Here we will utilize SHG microscopy to: 1) determine the how pathologic collagen organization (seen in IPF) differs from normal tissue; 2) identify and quantify areas of active fibrosis (enriched in collagen III) from ""old"" or mature fibrosis (high in collagen I) in IPF lung specimens; 3) assess changes in elastin and collagen distribution during disease progression; and 4) correlate areas of high collagen III/I signal in IPF histologic samples with clinical markers of disease activity. As part of the project, we will develop customized automated machine vision routines to automatically classify tissues in terms of severity. We will specifically focus all of our efforts on studying structure around fibroblastic foci, which will be identified by other microscope modalities. These foci are thought to be at the leading edge of ECM remodeling but the dynamics of their formation in relationship to the overall fibrotic process remain unclear. We hypothesize that these structural changes will serve as label- free biomarkers of IPF and further hypothesize that the collagen is altered specifically around foci in a manner which is associated with disease progression.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9119513,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,597688,0.04795080400243791
"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber. We propose to develop this into an ultraminiaturized microendoscope for functional brain imaging with minimal surgical damage in freely moving behaving animals.            ",Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals,9053610,R21EY026310,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Miniaturization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Penetration', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imprint', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lens', 'miniaturize', 'minimally invasive', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'targeted imaging', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NEI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2015,239361,0.03583797290311575
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.            ",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,8953102,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2015,180330,0.00977218725200438
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed collaborative project will investigate fundamental processes driving chordate embryogenesis. The project will combine the skills and expertise of two research groups: one that works in the area of developmental biology, and the other in the area of image analysis and computer vision. The goal of the project is take a whole-embryo embryo approach to investigating morphogenesis in live embryos in all 4 dimensions (x,y, z and t). Specifically, we will collect and analyze confocal microscopy images to derive quantitative data on the division, shape, volume and movements of all cells in both selected developing organs and in whole embryos. This project presents many challenges in sample selection and labeling, image capture, and image analysis and visualization. Most model organisms are fundamentally unsuited to the challenge of capturing the shape and movement of every cell in an entire tissue. Those that are suitable typically are distantly related to the chordates, and thus lack organs and tissues relevant to human health and disease. The ascidians (sea squirts), however, are close relatives of the vertebrates that combine a chordate body plan with a small and simple embryonic architecture suitable for imaging in toto. The data to be collected in such observations, particularly at the high resolution needed to observe cellular behavior, will be enormous. The extraction of large-scale quantitative information from timelapse image sets poses substantial challenges in terms of image segmentation and analysis. We have already made significant progress in segmenting 3D ascidian images and further refinements of these approaches are proposed here. The segmented data will allow the quantitative analysis of many complex cell behaviors, including the fundamental changes in cell shape and motility driving gastrulation, neurulation and convergent extension. These analyses will lead to specific hypotheses regarding the cellular and molecular machinery driving morphogenesis. To further investigate the molecular basis for these cellular phenomena, we will also extend our imaging and analysis efforts to investigate the dynamic patterns of subcellular localization of several proteins with key roles in morphogenesis. Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated. The project proposed here will combine the efforts of developmental biologists and computer engineers to capture and analyze images from live embryos with the goal of understanding cell behaviors in forming organs.",Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate,8889279,R01HD059217,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Organ', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell division', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroporation', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Movement', 'Myosin Light Chains', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plasmids', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Seeds', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'ascidian', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blastomere structure', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'convergent extension', 'developmental genetics', 'gastrulation', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging informatics', 'innovation', 'interest', 'moesin', 'professor', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein distribution', 'segmentation Image analysis', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue repair']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2015,317827,0.01582289454714157
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training.

"Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by unrelenting scarring and stiffening of the lungs that leads to the death of an estimated 34,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Unfortunately, individuals with IPF have extremely limited treatment options, as no effective drugs have been identified to halt the progression of fibrosis. Despite the importance of collagens to the structural organization both normal and remodeled ECM, little is known about how collagen structure in IPF differs from that of normal tissue architecture. There is a clear need to develop highly specific/sensitive techniques to probe collagen structure and organization in IPF tissues. In this project we will implement new collagen specific analyses using the high resolution microscopy technique of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). This method is sensitive to both the fibrillar organization and also sub-resolution aspects of macro and supramolecular assembly. Here we will utilize SHG microscopy to: 1) determine the how pathologic collagen organization (seen in IPF) differs from normal tissue; 2) identify and quantify areas of active fibrosis (enriched in collagen III) from ""old"" or mature fibrosis (high in collagen I) in IPF lung specimens; 3) assess changes in elastin and collagen distribution during disease progression; and 4) correlate areas of high collagen III/I signal in IPF histologic samples with clinical markers of disease activity. As part of the project, we will develop customized automated machine vision routines to automatically classify tissues in terms of severity. We will specifically focus all of our efforts on studying structure around fibroblastic foci, which will be identified by other microscope modalities. These foci are thought to be at the leading edge of ECM remodeling but the dynamics of their formation in relationship to the overall fibrotic process remain unclear. We hypothesize that these structural changes will serve as label- free biomarkers of IPF and further hypothesize that the collagen is altered specifically around foci in a manner which is associated with disease progression.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem addressed in this proposal is the development and evaluation of an automated noninvasive approach to discriminate different normal and pathological tissue types using machine learning algorithms; previous applications of machine learning have been based on features of the backscattered ultrasound that are essentially energy based. Our approach will be based on extracting features from images whose pixels are determined by the entropy contained in segments of the backscattered ultrasound. The unique attributes of entropy imaging suggest that the automated analysis we propose would be particularly robust for discrimination of deep tissues in a clinical environment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8653848,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,436094,0.058897451112206824
"Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed collaborative project will investigate fundamental processes driving chordate embryogenesis. The project will combine the skills and expertise of two research groups: one that works in the area of developmental biology, and the other in the area of image analysis and computer vision. The goal of the project is take a whole-embryo embryo approach to investigating morphogenesis in live embryos in all 4 dimensions (x,y, z and t). Specifically, we will collect and analyze confocal microscopy images to derive quantitative data on the division, shape, volume and movements of all cells in both selected developing organs and in whole embryos. This project presents many challenges in sample selection and labeling, image capture, and image analysis and visualization. Most model organisms are fundamentally unsuited to the challenge of capturing the shape and movement of every cell in an entire tissue. Those that are suitable typically are distantly related to the chordates, and thus lack organs and tissues relevant to human health and disease. The ascidians (sea squirts), however, are close relatives of the vertebrates that combine a chordate body plan with a small and simple embryonic architecture suitable for imaging in toto. The data to be collected in such observations, particularly at the high resolution needed to observe cellular behavior, will be enormous. The extraction of large-scale quantitative information from timelapse image sets poses substantial challenges in terms of image segmentation and analysis. We have already made significant progress in segmenting 3D ascidian images and further refinements of these approaches are proposed here. The segmented data will allow the quantitative analysis of many complex cell behaviors, including the fundamental changes in cell shape and motility driving gastrulation, neurulation and convergent extension. These analyses will lead to specific hypotheses regarding the cellular and molecular machinery driving morphogenesis. To further investigate the molecular basis for these cellular phenomena, we will also extend our imaging and analysis efforts to investigate the dynamic patterns of subcellular localization of several proteins with key roles in morphogenesis.          Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated. The project proposed here will combine the efforts of developmental biologists and computer engineers to capture and analyze images from live embryos with the goal of understanding cell behaviors in forming organs.

"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training.

Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8508596,K99LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K99,2013,87300,0.0747022751973903
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"InCell 6000 High Content Instrument for Cellular Systems Biology Program     DESCRIPTION: The General Electric Healthcare, InCell 6000 High Content Analysis (HCA) instrument is being requested to allow investigators from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Carnegie Mellon University to analyze complex cellular processes in both fixed and living cells, multicellular model systems and research organisms (Zebra Fish and C. elegans). This high instrument combines a high scan-rate confocal imaging device, an environmental chamber, 4-channel fluorescence, transmitted light and on-board fluid addition in a microplate-based system. The InCell 6000 permits automated, high throughput and high temporal and spatial resolution of subcelluar structures and biochemical reactions that are the basis of all cellular and tissue functions. The long-term objective is to extend our present capabilities in acquiring high temporal, spatial and spectral images from a small sample size to the acquisition of large data sets from populations of cells on a cell-by-cell basis, tissue models and experimental animals. This new capability will permit the application of computational and systems biology tools to understand the complexities of life processes based on statistical significance not possible before. The integration of the best biological experimental systems, fluorescence-based reagents and high throughput, automated imaging will enable large, combinatorial treatments of samples to allow the exploration of statistically relevant mechanisms of action in a variety of therapeutic areas. The NIH funded projects that will use this instrument include investigations on human adipocyte differentiation in cancer, the physiology of stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, the heterogeneity of drug responses in head and neck cancer models, the role of the immune response in cancer therapies, live, 3D breast cancer models with the analysis of pathways, cell migration in tumor models, modulation of Huntington's Disease progression in model systems, protein misfolding disease model of alpha 1- antitrypsin deficiency (ATD), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) models in C. elgans. In addition, a kidney regeneration model in Zebra fish to identify small molecules that stimulate stem cell proliferation, as well as the application of a new generation of genetically encoded biosensors, standards for imaging and flow cytometry and the further application of active machine learning optimization of experimental strategies. The application of this platform to fundamental biomedical research and translational research programs will ultimately lead to better success in drug discovery and development, while helping to define the mechanisms of normal and disease processes.              n/a",InCell 6000 High Content Instrument for Cellular Systems Biology Program,8332956,S10OD012269,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biosensor', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cancer Model', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Migration Pathway', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Imaging Device', 'Immune response', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Natural regeneration', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Zebrafish', 'adipocyte differentiation', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'instrument', 'programs', 'protein misfolding', 'response', 'small molecule', 'success', 'systems research', 'tool', 'tumor']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,S10,2013,502020,-0.007769572113870966
"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.        Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

"Morphomic analysis of a simple chordate     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed collaborative project will investigate fundamental processes driving chordate embryogenesis. The project will combine the skills and expertise of two research groups: one that works in the area of developmental biology, and the other in the area of image analysis and computer vision. The goal of the project is take a whole-embryo embryo approach to investigating morphogenesis in live embryos in all 4 dimensions (x,y, z and t). Specifically, we will collect and analyze confocal microscopy images to derive quantitative data on the division, shape, volume and movements of all cells in both selected developing organs and in whole embryos. This project presents many challenges in sample selection and labeling, image capture, and image analysis and visualization. Most model organisms are fundamentally unsuited to the challenge of capturing the shape and movement of every cell in an entire tissue. Those that are suitable typically are distantly related to the chordates, and thus lack organs and tissues relevant to human health and disease. The ascidians (sea squirts), however, are close relatives of the vertebrates that combine a chordate body plan with a small and simple embryonic architecture suitable for imaging in toto. The data to be collected in such observations, particularly at the high resolution needed to observe cellular behavior, will be enormous. The extraction of large-scale quantitative information from timelapse image sets poses substantial challenges in terms of image segmentation and analysis. We have already made significant progress in segmenting 3D ascidian images and further refinements of these approaches are proposed here. The segmented data will allow the quantitative analysis of many complex cell behaviors, including the fundamental changes in cell shape and motility driving gastrulation, neurulation and convergent extension. These analyses will lead to specific hypotheses regarding the cellular and molecular machinery driving morphogenesis. To further investigate the molecular basis for these cellular phenomena, we will also extend our imaging and analysis efforts to investigate the dynamic patterns of subcellular localization of several proteins with key roles in morphogenesis.          Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated. The project proposed here will combine the efforts of developmental biologists and computer engineers to capture and analyze images from live embryos with the goal of understanding cell behaviors in forming organs.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.            ",ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS,8636638,R21EB018095,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Base Composition', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expeditions', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Fractals', 'Frequencies', 'Heart', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Microscopic', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data reduction', 'design', 'detector', 'heart motion', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'n-dimensional', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'sound', 'tissue processing', 'vector']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,228000,0.03728637886511899

"Optimizing Peripheral Nerve Regeneration using Computational Intelligence based T    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Peripheral nerve injuries are common diseases that affect a large amount of patients every year.  Tissue engineering has emerged as a powerful approach for developing alternative nerve grafts for peripheral nerve regeneration.  Since tissue engineering strategies in peripheral nerve regeneration involve various possible combinations of variables, it is necessary to develop efficient tools to identify optimal tissue engineering strategies and predict the experimental results based on these tissue engineering strategies for peripheral nerve regeneration.  Some research groups have applied artificial neural networks and decision trees to obtain the best model configuration for the prediction of the tissue engineering strategies.  For the decision trees based methods, it is hard to tell which classification tree is better than the other.  Furthermore, the prediction system using the decision tree algorithm lacks the capability of accumulating the learning experience over time.  On the other hand, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibit some remarkable properties, but only the connection weights are trained with fixed topology.  It is hard to find the best fixed topology in advance for each specific tissue engineering strategy.  In this proposal, swarm intelligence (SI) based evolving ANNs technique is proposed to tackle this challenge.  Two swarm intelligence based methods, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), will be applied in this project to train the ANN model.  More specifically, ACO will be used to optimize the topology structure of the ANN models, while the PSO is used to adjust the connection weights of the ANN models based on the optimized topology structure.  For this SWarm Intelligence based Reinforcement Learning method for ANNs (SWIRL-ANN) system, both topology and connection weight of artificial neural networks can be evolved automatically and simultaneously so that an optimal classifier for tissue engineering strategies in peripheral nerve regeneration can be achieved.  The research project will include the following phases:  Aim 1:  Predict tissue engineering strategies in peripheral nerve regeneration using SWarm Intelligence based Reinforcement Learning method for ANNs (SWIRL-ANN) analytical and prediction system.  Aim 2:  Validate the efficacy of novel unknown tissue engineered nerve grafts as predicted by using SWIRL-ANN based analytical and prediction system for bridging peripheral nerve gaps in rat sciatic nerve injury model in vivo.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tissue engineering has emerged as a powerful approach for developing nerve grafts for peripheral nerve regeneration.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8163481,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2011,459174,0.058897451112206824
"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This platform can be used for an assessment of LNM which is paramount for appropriate treatment planning.           Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application.

"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7904306,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,48929,0.051194881989035795
"Morphomic Analysis of a Simple Chordate The original application proposed a comprehensive characterization of morphogenesis in both wild type and experimentally manipulated embryos. Emphasis was to be placed on characterizing morphogenesis in both the notochord and the central nervous system. We also proposed to image experimentally manipulated embryos in which key embryogenesis genes were knocked down. In this revised two-year study we will restrict our efforts to the developing notochord in wild-type embryos. Our goal in focusing on the notochord is to establish the methodologies for image capture, segmentation and analysis that will be of broadest potential use to us, and others. In collecting the embryo images for this analysis we will be capturing the embryos in toto and in high resolution. Thus, while we will be focusing on the notochord, the image sets will be amenable to the analysis of other tissues in future studies. The notochord will serve as an ideal model for developing these methods. Besides the universal importance of the notochord for chordate development, the ascidian notochord presents a range of challenges for computer segmentation and analysis, yet it is probably the most tractable tissues in the embryo because of the low and fixed numbers of cells, and the fact that once cell intercalation is completed, the overall arrangement of the cells does not change. In the Preliminary Results section we demonstrated 3D time-lapse imaging of live embryos by both DIC and fluorescence microscopy. In this revised proposal we will continue with both of these imaging methods. As in the original proposal, several approaches for notochord cell segmentation will be pursued and optimized. We have presented preliminary results with two very different approaches for cell boundary detection: network snakes for DIC images; and a watershed-based method for confocal images of live embryos stained with a fluorescent membrane dye. We expect that concentrating on the notochord will allow us to make substantial contributions in only two years while building tools that can later be extended to more challenging tissues. Finally, we will develop tools for the morphometric analysis and visualization of the notochord data.  Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated.

"Accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities with multi-color image processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The combination of high resolution assays in genomics with microscopic imaging has been used for the detection of complex chromosomal rearrangements, a significant but difficult problem in prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, birth defect detection and cancer research. As a recently developed molecular cytogenetic technique, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) imaging has provided rapid and high resolution detection of chromosomal abnormalities associated with cancer and genetic disorders. However, the technique is currently limited to research use and only serves as an adjunct tool to the G-banding based monochromatic chromosomal karyotyping in a clinical laboratory. A primary barrier of the technique is the lower classification accuracy when classifying chromosomes from multi-color microscopic imaging data. Therefore, the goal of this R15 project is to develop innovative multi-spectral image processing and machine learning techniques for M-FISH image analysis so that chromosomal rearrangement detection can be made more reproducible, robust, and faster, thereby significantly increasing the ability and efficacy of this newly developed cellular imaging technique. Our proposed approaches such as multiscale feature extraction, nonlinear manifold analysis and adaptive fuzzy clustering are able to target specific features of multi-spectral imaging data, promising a significant improvement over the current techniques. In order to validate the technique and bring it into clinical use, we will partner with a clinical geneticist, Dr. Merlin Butler, and a cytogeneticist, Dr. Diane Persons both at Kansas University Medical Center. In addition, we will collaborate with an industrial scientist, Dr. Kenneth Castleman, who is the pioneer in developing and commercializing cytogenetic imaging products. Through our interdisciplinary research and collaboration, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) develop image normalization approaches to improve the acquisition of multi-color FISH images; 2) develop multiscale dimension analysis to extract features from multi-color images; 3) design adaptive fuzzy clustering and incorporate contextual information to improve the pixel-wise classification of chromosomes; and 4) validate computational approaches with clinical testing in collaboration with medical and industrial partners. This research project will also enhance our research infrastructure in biomedical image informatics and provide undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to touch the frontier of molecular and cellular imaging by participating in the proposed research activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses. Our proposed approaches have the potential to significantly improve the reliability of the newly developed M-FISH imaging technique, making it feasible for clinical use. This will in turn benefit the health of human beings. Furthermore, the developed computational techniques can be applicable to a wide range of multi-color bio-imaging problems, thereby having a broad impact on the biomedical community.           Project Narrative Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7668441,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,275279,0.051194881989035795
"Morphomic Analysis of a Simple Chordate The original application proposed a comprehensive characterization of morphogenesis in both wild type and experimentally manipulated embryos. Emphasis was to be placed on characterizing morphogenesis in both the notochord and the central nervous system. We also proposed to image experimentally manipulated embryos in which key embryogenesis genes were knocked down. In this revised two-year study we will restrict our efforts to the developing notochord in wild-type embryos. Our goal in focusing on the notochord is to establish the methodologies for image capture, segmentation and analysis that will be of broadest potential use to us, and others. In collecting the embryo images for this analysis we will be capturing the embryos in toto and in high resolution. Thus, while we will be focusing on the notochord, the image sets will be amenable to the analysis of other tissues in future studies. The notochord will serve as an ideal model for developing these methods. Besides the universal importance of the notochord for chordate development, the ascidian notochord presents a range of challenges for computer segmentation and analysis, yet it is probably the most tractable tissues in the embryo because of the low and fixed numbers of cells, and the fact that once cell intercalation is completed, the overall arrangement of the cells does not change. In the Preliminary Results section we demonstrated 3D time-lapse imaging of live embryos by both DIC and fluorescence microscopy. In this revised proposal we will continue with both of these imaging methods. As in the original proposal, several approaches for notochord cell segmentation will be pursued and optimized. We have presented preliminary results with two very different approaches for cell boundary detection: network snakes for DIC images; and a watershed-based method for confocal images of live embryos stained with a fluorescent membrane dye. We expect that concentrating on the notochord will allow us to make substantial contributions in only two years while building tools that can later be extended to more challenging tissues. Finally, we will develop tools for the morphometric analysis and visualization of the notochord data. Organs and tissues are built during embryogenesis through the precise interactions of a myriad of cells and cell types. Advances in tissue repair and engineering will require that the rules and mechanisms that govern how cells come together to form organs and tissues be elucidated. The project proposed here will combine the efforts of developmental biologists and computer engineers to capture and analyze images from live embryos with the goal of understanding cell behaviors in forming organs.",Morphomic Analysis of a Simple Chordate,7677473,R01HD059217,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell Size', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyes', 'Economics', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and Supplies', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphogenesis', 'Movement', 'Neuraxis', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Snakes', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Students', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Visualization software', 'Wound Healing', 'ascidian', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'career', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'economic impact', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'intercalation', 'knock-down', 'multidisciplinary', 'notochord', 'post-doctoral training', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2009,397786,-0.003982699538399371

"In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescence-based molecular Imaging in small animals is having a major impact on drug development and disease research. However, a significant challenge to imaging targeted fluorescent markers in vivo remains: unless the labeled regions are located superficially; localization, quantitation and host organ identification are impeded by the effects of light scattering and absorption. Orthotopic tumor and disease models are increasingly preferred over less biologically relevant subcutaneous xenografts. In such studies, substantial difficulties are encountered in longitudinal studies where animals are growing and are positioned differently for each measurement. We believe that a single imaging advance could address many of these issues, and advance the utility of in-vivo molecular imaging: an exact anatomical co-registration technique that does not rely on multimodal techniques. This proposal describes dynamic molecular imaging (DMI), an approach that can provide co-registered anatomical information by exploiting in-vivo pharmacokinetics of dyes in small animals in a simple and inexpensive way. We demonstrate that by acquiring a time-series of optical images during injection of an inert dye, we can repeatably and accurately delineate the major internal organs of mice using optical imaging alone. This is possible because each major organ is ""illuminated"" by the kinetics of dye passing through it in such a manner as to make it distinguishable from other structures. Spatiotemporal analysis can exploit these characteristic time courses to allow the body-surface representation of each organ to be visualized. These in- vivo anatomical maps can be overlaid onto simultaneously acquired images of a targeted molecular probe (detected and distinguished from the mapping dye via multispectral imaging techniques, if necessary) to significantly aid in identification of the probe's anatomical and physical location. Using CRi's existing and prototype 2D, ""2.5D"" and true 3D multispectral mouse imaging systems, we propose to test and refine a DMI approach. Based on our findings to date, we will examine and exploit in-vivo pharmacokinetics of the near-infrared dye, indocyanine green, to generate delineated surface projections of individual organs. Co-registering this surface map with surface projections of detected targeted labels will allow the targeted probe's 3D spatial location to be inferred. This information can further be used to improve quantitative accuracy in longitudinal molecular imaging studies of deep targets.           n/a",In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE),7485551,R43EB008627,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Body Surface', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Dyes', 'Fluorescence', 'General Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Animal Imaging Systems', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Visualization software', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Xenograft procedure', 'absorption', 'base', 'blind', 'data acquisition', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'longitudinal animal study', 'millimeter', 'molecular imaging', 'novel strategies', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'prototype', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'subcutaneous', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R43,2008,167462,0.01826634006218351
"FLUORESCENT SPECKLE MICROSCOPY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is a technique we initially developed for measuring the movements and sites of polymerization/depolymerization of individual microtubules (MTs) and arrays of actin filaments in motile tissue culture cells and the poleward flux of MTs within spindle fibers during mitosis. Assembly of these polymers from a pool containing a low percentage of fluorescently labeled subunits (about 1% or less) produces a random distribution of fluorophores along the polymer lattice that produces ""fluorescent speckle"" fiduciary marks varying from zero to several fluorophores (5-8) within the diffraction limited resolution of the microscope. The major focus of this application is on the further development of the FSM method for the analysis of MT function in spindle mechanics. In particular, how MT and kinetochore proteins function in spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and accurate chromosome segregation. This requires the development of new FSM microscope technology for the rapid recording of multi-wavelength and 3-D time-lapse images of MT fluorescent speckles relative to fluorescent marks or speckles at kinetochores, poles, MT associated proteins (MAPs), motor proteins and MT ends. A major next step for FSM to become a powerful analytical tool for these systems is the development of new Computer Vision methods for obtaining quantitative information about polymer movement and turnover in 2-D and 3-D at high resolution relative to the other molecular fluorescent markers in the spindle. To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells.

The cells expressing GFP in these samples will provide data for the development of next-generation instrumentation during Phase II.       Phase II will add capabilities to use the fluorescence image data to intelligently acquire thin sections only when fluorescent cells are detected.

To study protein function, we are particularly interested in optimizing FSM for genetic model organisms including budding yeast, for the biochemically accessible Xenopus egg extracts and for siRNA with mammalian tissue cells.

"Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cochlea is a remarkable sensor: a living cochlea can reliably detect sounds that cause motions of the stapes on the order of picometers, is capable of high-quality frequency analysis (Q10dB > 600), and compresses the large dynamic range (120 dB) of hearing into the considerably smaller dynamic range (20- 50 dB) of neurons. It is now widely accepted that an active mechanical amplification process underlies these remarkable properties. However, there is considerable debate about the nature of the amplifier. While information on the cellular and molecular basis of hearing is increasing rapidly, there is still little understanding of how the components interoperate to generate the remarkable properties of hearing.       To date, the most successful experimental studies of cellular motions in living cochleae have used optical methods. However, current methods, such as laser Doppler vibrometry and video microscopy are limited by the low reflectivities of cochlear structures and the limited optical access provided by the intact cochea. The objective of this grant is to develop and apply a new tomographic imaging and motion measurement technique capable of determining the three-dimensional motions of all structures in a living, intact cochlea. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to obtain high-resolution images of the cochlea. Images will be acquired through a narrow opening similar to that used in laser Doppler vibrometry methods, or possibly directly through bone. Sequences of stroboscopic images will be generated with synchronous demodulation of the OCT detector signal during acoustic stimulation. Computer vision algorithms (similar to those used in video microscopy methods) will be used to determine motions with nanometer resolution.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7148587,R01NS055064,"['brain', 'clinical research', 'embryo /fetus']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2006,274794,0.051194881989035795

"Rare Cell Analysis by Multi-Spectral Flow Imaging The ability to detect and analyze rare malignant cells in body fluids has profound implications for the early detection of malignancy as well as for monitoring of residual disease and metastases. Current methodologies for accurately detecting abnormal cells within a population of normal cells are limited. Amnis' ImageStream technology combines the high-resolution imaging performance of microscopy and the high-speed cellular analysis and sorting capabilities of flow cytometry in a single platform. ImageStream employs time delay integration detection, resulting in up to a 1000 fold increase in signal collection over conventional instrument designs. The goal of this Phase I study is to optimize algorithms, electronics, and assays for the detection and analysis of rare exfoliated cells in body fluids. The image segmentation algorithm will be redesigned to operate with brightfield imagery as well as fluorescence and implemented on high-speed image computing hardware. A morphological feature set will be developed to discriminate epithelial cells. Ultimately, it is expected that instrumentation based on ImageStream technology will find application in the biological research laboratory, drug discovery arena, and in the clinical setting as a screening system for he early detection of cancer.

"AI platform for microscopy image restoration and virtual staining AI Platform for Microscopy Image Restoration and Virtual Staining Project Summary:  Fluorescence microscopy has enabled many major discoveries in biomedical sciences. Despite the rapid advancements in optics, lasers, probes, cameras and novel techniques, major factors such as spatial and temporal resolution, light exposure, signal-to-noise, depth of penetration and probe spectra continue to limit the types of experiments that are possible. Deep learning (DL) algorithms are well suited for image-based problems like SNR/super-resolution restoration and virtual staining, which have great enabling potentials for microscopy experiments. Previously impossible experiments could be realized such as achieving high signal-to-noise and/or spatial-temporal resolution without photobleaching/phototoxicity; simultaneously observing many image channels without interfering with native processes, etc. This could pave the way for a quantum leap forward in microscopy-based discoveries that elucidate biological functions and the mechanisms of disorders, and enable new diagnostics and therapies for human diseases.  However, these new methods have not been widely translated to new microscopy experiments. The delay is due to several practical hurdles and challenges such as required expertise, computing and trust. In order to accelerate the adoption of DL in microscopy, novel AI platform tailored for biologists are needed for training, applying and validating DL models and outputs.  The present project aims to develop an AI platform for microscopy image restoration and virtual staining called AI for Restoring and Staining (AIRS) platform. With our collaborator, Dr. Hari Shroff (National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering) we have successfully created DL models for SNR restoration, super-resolution restoration and virtual staining for a variety of imaging conditions and organelles in our preliminary studies. The AIRS platform intends to (1)provide a comprehensive suite of validated DL models for microscopy restoration and virtual staining applications including SNR restoration, super-resolution restoration, spatial deconvolution, spectral unmixing, prediction of 3d from 2d images, organelle virtual staining and analysis; (2)provide plug and play for common microscopy experiments; (3)provide semi-automatic update training to tailor DL models to match advanced microscopy experiments; (4)provide user friendly support for new DL model training for pioneering microscopy experiments; (5)provide confidence scores to assess the output results by a DL model, (6) provide DL models that avoid image artifact (hallucination) and allow continuous learning and evolution; (7) and be able to access the required computing infrastructure and database connection. Project Narrative Deep learning (DL) algorithms have great enabling potentials for microscopy experiments. Previously impossible experiments could now be realized. This could pave the way for a quantum leap forward in microscopy-based discoveries.  Powered by deep learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Hari Shroff and 7 additional labs, this project aims to create an AI platform for microscopy image restorations and virtual staining called AI for restoring and staining (AIRS).

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9989025,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,612684,0.04183127880964487
"2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting to be held from February 25-27, 2021, which will be the seventh of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and lodging for junior researchers who will be presenting at the workshop: undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty. Some funds may also be allocated to help pay for live webcasting and publication costs related to workshop materials. As with previous meetings, we intend to stream each session of the meeting in real-time, allowing those who are interested in the proceedings but unable to attend in person to access them online for free. As mortalities associated with pulmonary disease continue to rise worldwide, innovative imaging techniques capable of both diagnosing and helping to treat these pathologies are becoming an increasingly important. As a field, pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the structural, functional and molecular assessment of lung disorders than at any time in its history. What is more, these techniques are being developed and optimized by researchers across an increasingly diverse set of fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, computer science and medicine. Given the field's rapidly-evolving nature, the existence of a regular forum in which scientists and clinicians can communicate their ideas with each other is of the utmost importance. Given the absence of other scientific meetings with a similarly focused agenda, our previous workshops have succeeded in providing just such a forum—allowing a diverse group of pulmonary imaging researchers to come together for the kind of rigorous, collaborative exchange that can continue to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) host a one-day workshop on pulmonary inflammation; (2) inform the pulmonary imaging community of the latest advances in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (3) explore the use of pulmonary imaging to evaluate therapeutic response, the inherent obstacles to doing so, and strategies to overcome them; (4) investigate new approaches for integrating deep learning and pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately diagnose and phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (5) broadcast the entire workshop live online, thereby enabling interested parties not in attendance to access the proceedings in real-time, free of charge. Based on the uniformly positive feedback in response to our one-day boot camp on pulmonary physiology prior to the 2019 workshop, we intend to hold another boot camp before the 2021 meeting, this time focused on pulmonary inflammation. This boot camp will consist of ~5 longer presentations (approximately 1 hour each) on topics related to this central theme, with significant time devoted to question and answer after each, and a final discussion panel aimed at synthesizing the most important issues covered over the course of the day. In addition to this exciting addition to the format, the 2021 workshop will again seek a more equitable balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease across the invited talks, while also continuing to expand our recent focus on the topics of imaging assessments of treatment response and the integration of imaging techniques with machine learning. Finally, the 2021 workshop add a session on bridging the gap between current clinical practice and innovative imaging technologies. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. This recurring workshop provides a necessary and valuable opportunity for researchers working in the fields of functional, structural, and molecular imaging technique development for assessing lung diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, IPF and ARDS to come together in order to discuss and share their work.

"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",9995686,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,178842,-0.03991434539175252
"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling.

"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,10016296,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,252175,0.05988606403056793
"A Novel Cryopreservation Technology for Large Skin Grafts to Facilitate Tissue Banking and Allograft Transplantations SUMMARY As a result of recent and rapid advances of immunogenetical, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies, the accuracy and efficiency of donor-recipient immunogenetical matching are expected to be significantly improved. As such, traditional tissue banking practices are being severely challenged due to low cryopreservation throughput. Skin allograft transplantations are currently utilized for numerous clinical applications. In such applications, donor tissues are now typically utilized as “expensive bandages”, i.e. for temporary coverage, thereby requiring painful and damaging follow-on autotransplantation procedures. With tremendously improved skin graft cryopreservation methods coupled with use of HLA matching based on AI network, future tissue banking platforms can potentially provide grafts to be used as permanent and definitive treatment for patients, thereby bringing high impact to clinical applications and the healthcare industry. Based on CryoCrate’s novel ultra-fast (106 K/min on a sample surface) cooling technology platform (PCT/US2019/26162), this project aims to develop a highly efficient (approaching 100% post-thaw viability) tissue graft cryopreservation prototype system that requires no cryoprotectant. The post-thaw viability and functionality will be assessed by standard in vitro assays using porcine and human skin (research exempt) grafts and in vivo assays using a mouse model. After achieving these aims, in future phase II and III stages, CryoCrate and its academic collaborator will collaborate with a local Organ Procurement Organization (Mid-America Transplant) and a wound healing clinic (University of Missouri Hospital) for porcine and human skin transplantation studies and clinical trials. Narrative A novel skin graft cryopreservation technology that requires no cryoprotectant will be developed to significantly improve efficiencies for tissue banking and allograft transplantation practices. This project initiates collaboration between CryoCrate LLC and local stakeholders, and thereby paves a path to commercialization of a new generation of ultra‐fast tissue cryopreservation devices.",A Novel Cryopreservation Technology for Large Skin Grafts to Facilitate Tissue Banking and Allograft Transplantations,10011745,R43AI155070,"['Allografting', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autologous Transplantation', 'Bandage', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cryopreserved Tissue', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Freeze Drying', 'Freezing', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunogenetics', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'In Vitro', 'Liquid substance', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Organ Procurements', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Skin graft', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical application', 'commercialization', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'scale up', 'skin allograft', 'success', 'transplant model', 'two-dimensional', 'wound healing']",NIAID,"CRYOCRATE, LLC",R43,2020,160371,0.030395940526284686
"Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc- tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi- ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol- ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam- ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo- rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us- ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti- cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in- clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova- tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol- umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo- rithms will segment the images at multiple scales.

"A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images Abstract  The ability of accurate localize and characterize cells in light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) image is indispensable for shedding new light on the understanding of three dimensional structures of the whole brain. In our previous work, we have successfully developed a 2D nuclear segmentation method for the nuclear cleared microscopy images using deep learning techniques. Although the convolutional neural networks show promise in segmenting cells in LSFM images, our previous work is confined in 2D segmentation scenario and suffers from the limited number of annotated data. In this project, we aim to develop a high throughput 3D cell segmentation engine, with the focus on improving the segmentation accuracy and generality. First, we will develop a cloud based semi-automatic annotation platform using the strength of virtual reality (VR) and crowd sourcing. The user-friendly annotation environment and stereoscopic view in VR can significantly improve the efficiency of manual annotation. We design a semi-automatic annotation workflow to largely reduce human intervention, and thus improve both the accuracy and the replicability of annotation across different users. Enlightened by the spirit of citizen science, we will extend the annotation software into a crowd sourcing platform which allows us to obtain a massive number of manual annotations in short time. Second, we will develop a fully 3D cell segmentation engine using 3D convolutional neural networks trained with the 3D annotated samples. Since it is often difficult to acquire isotropic LSFM images, we will further develop a super resolution method to impute a high resolution image to facilitate the 3D cell segmentation. Third, we will develop a transfer learning framework to make our 3D cell segmentation engine general enough to the application of novel LSFM data which might have significant gap of image appearance due to different imaging setup or clearing/staining protocol. This general framework will allow us to rapidly develop a specific cell segmentation solution for new LSFM data with very few or even no manual annotations, by transferring the existing 3D segmentation engine that has been trained with a sufficient number of annotated samples. Fourth, we will apply our computational tools to several pilot neuroscience studies: (1) Investigating how topoisomerase I (one of the autism linked transcriptional regulators) regulates brain structure, and (2) Investigating genetic influence on cell types in the developing human brain by quantifying the number of progenitor cells in fetal cortical tissue. Successful carrying out our project will have wide-reaching impact in neuroscience community in visualizing and analyzing complete cellular resolution maps of individual cell types within healthy and disease brain. The improved cell segmentation engine in 3D allows scientists from all over the world to share and process each other’s data accurately and efficiently, thus increasing reproducibility and power. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a next generation cell segmentation engine for the whole brain tissue cleared images. Our proposed work is built upon our previous 2D nuclear segmentation project using deep learning techniques. However, we found that our current computational tool is limited in 2D segmentation scenario and insufficient of annotated training samples. To address these limitations, we will first develop a cloud-based semi-automatic annotation tool with the capacity of virtual reality. Our annotation tool is designed to be cross- platform, which allows us to partner with “SciStarter” (the largest citizen science projects in the world) and acquire large amount of cell annotations from the science enthusiastic volunteers. Meanwhile, we will develop next generation 3D cell segmentation engine using an end-to-end fully connected convolution neural network. To facilitate 3D cell segmentation, we will also develop a super resolution method to impute an isotropic high- resolution image from a low-resolution microscopy image. After the development of 3D cell segmentation engine, we will continue to improve its generality by developing a transfer learning framework which enables us to rapidly deploy our 3D cell segmentation engine to the novel microscopy images without the time-consuming manual annotation step. Finally, we will apply our segmentation tool to visualize and quantify brain structure differences within genetically characterized mouse and human brain tissue at UNC neuroscience center. In the end of this project, we will release the software (both binary program and source code) and the 3D cell annotations, in order to facilitate the similar neuroscience studies in other institutes. Considering the importance of high throughput computational tools in quantifying three dimensional brain structure, this cutting- edge technique will be very useful in neuroscience research community.",A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images,9923760,R01NS110791,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anecdotes', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source Code', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Type I DNA Topoisomerases', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fetal', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'stem cells', 'stereoscopic', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality', 'volunteer']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,335344,0.010815496441333445
"Super-multiplexed fluorescence nanoscopy for imaging-based proteomics PROJECT SUMMARY In situ immunofluorescence imaging is a powerful method to study the locations, expression levels and structures of proteins in cells and tissues. In particular, multiplexed imaging reveals the interaction networks of proteins, which allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms of many diseases. However, it has been challenging to perform multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging due to its extremely time-consuming process, high cost and lack of signal amplification. The limited spatial resolution achievable with confocal microscopy often fails to reveal complex spatial organization and to determine localizations of proteins. Here we propose super-multiplexed immunofluorescence nanoscopy that is capable of imaging more than twenty different proteins in 24 hours with nanoscale resolution. We will employ DNA-barcoded secondary nanobodies that are monovalent, open-source and designed for quantitative labeling. Repeated introduction and washing of fluorescent DNA imagers will generate highly multiplexed images. Moreover, we will develop unprecedentedly fast stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy that employs a parallelized line array of doughnut beams. It will feature a large imaging area and excellent optical sectioning capability. Photon reassignment, hyperspectral imaging and deep-learning will further facilitate rapid super-resolution-based protein profiling. Our new biochemical and optical tools will play crucial roles in diverse biomedical areas including brain proteomics and cancer profiling. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop highly multiplexed immunofluorescence super-resolution imaging tools.

"Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy Project Summary/Abstract Abnormal alterations of tissue microcirculation are often associated with early stage of tissue pathology. Detection and characterization of these early microvascular abnormalities can greatly benefit clinical diagnosis and treatment monitoring as well as facilitating the creation of new therapies to counter disease development. For decades, there has been a longstanding quest for the development of a clinical imaging modality that can noninvasively and directly image such tissue microvascular variations. To date, however, such an imaging method remains elusive due to the fundamental compromise between imaging spatial resolution and depth penetration. Therefore, the long-term objective of this project is to fulfill this unmet clinical need by developing the next-generation ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM), which is an ultrasound-based imaging technique that can directly assess structural and functional tissue microvasculature in vivo in humans at a clinically relevant depth. Different from other imaging modalities, ULM is not limited by the resolution-penetration compromise: ULM can noninvasively image capillary-scale microvessels at several centimeters depth and quantitatively measure their blood flow speed (as low as 1 mm/s). Such combination of deep imaging penetration and exquisite spatial resolution and the unique functionality of measuring small vessel blood flow speed make ULM a promising technique for many clinical applications including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. At present, however, ULM is not ready for clinical use due to several key technical limitations: 1) ULM data acquisition is very slow (tens of seconds with breath holding); 2) ULM post-processing is very expensive computationally (several hours to generate a single 2D ULM image); 3) ULM is difficult to be extended to 3D imaging (which is important for comprehensive evaluation of tissue microvasculature such as in cancer applications). These limitations largely forbids ULM from being effectively used in the clinic to provide useful microvascular biomarkers. In this proposal, we will concentrate on addressing these technical barriers and transform ULM to a truly useful clinical imaging tool. Our approach synergistically combines deep learning (DL), parallel computing, and ultrafast 3D ultrasound imaging to fundamentally shorten ULM data acquisition time, substantially accelerate ULM post-processing, and enhance ULM to 3D imaging. Our first aim will develop and validate DL-based ULM data processing algorithms that would enable real-time 4D morphometric ULM and fast 3D quantitative ULM. Our method uniquely collects real labeled optical imaging data on a chicken embryo microvessel model for DL training. Our second aim will focus on realizing 3D-ULM on a 2D row-column-addressing transducer with ultrafast 3D plane wave imaging. We will develop a DL-based beamforming technique to enable high-fidelity 3D microbubble imaging for robust 3D-ULM. Our final aim will focus on validating the in vivo performance of the newly developed 3D-ULM imaging techniques on a mouse tumor model. We will be collaborating with world-renowned experts in deep learning, optical imaging, and comparative medicine at the University of Illinois to accomplish these aims of the proposal. Project Narrative Imaging-based detection and characterization of abnormal tissue microvascular variations is clinically significant for diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and therapy development in many pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. At present, there is no viable noninvasive imaging tool that can fulfill this important clinical need. To fill this gap, we propose to develop a new ultrasound-based super-resolution microvessel imaging technique that can directly and quantitatively assess the structure and the function of tissue microcirculation in vivo in humans.",Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy,10039725,R21EB030072,"['3-Dimensional', '3D ultrasound', '4T1', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chickens', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incentives', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbubbles', 'Microcirculation', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optical imaging', 'parallel computer', 'performance tests', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'real-time images', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'two photon microscopy']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565346,0.055896079073616406
"Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy Project Summary/Abstract “Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy” Positioning of cells in tissues is intimately linked to major cellular- and organ-level processes. Appropriate localization promotes exposure of cells to specific microenvironments and stimuli that define their differentiation states and functions. Cellular positioning also determines local tissue microanatomy, as well as the global macro-architecture, allowing for proper organ function and physiology. Thus, understanding the links among cellular positioning, heterogeneity and global tissue architecture are critical for biomedical research. However, current tools for understanding such relationships are limiting. Here, we will develop novel approaches to study cells using currently existing high-content tools, but importantly while also retaining information on the precise positioning of cells within tissues (Aim 1). This will allow us to interrogate how cellular heterogeneity and function is influenced by the exposure to distinct tissue microenvironments and localized stimuli. Further, we will generate novel computational approaches to understand how cellular positioning defines global tissue architecture (Aim 2). For this, we will develop a robust analytical methodology based on machine learning algorithms to study how complex patterns of cellular spatial positioning influences tissue organization and structure. These approaches will be broadly applicable across diverse disciplines of biology for both murine and human (or other species) studies, and will be highly pertinent in clinical settings, such as for cancer diagnostics. In summary, the proposed studies are significant, as they will provide a new toolbox for studying cellular and organ physiology based on cellular tissue positioning, as well as will lead to the development of new diagnostic tools for clinical medicine. Project narrative / Relevance statement The positioning of cells in tissues is critical for shaping both the cellular identity and function, as well as the structure and physiology of the entire organ. The proposed research will generate a novel, comprehensive toolbox for interrogating the relationships among cellular spatial positioning, cell heterogeneity, as well as tissue architecture. These tools will be relevant to public health because they will promote a better fundamental understanding of cellular and organ physiology, and because the developed tools will be directly applicable to the clinic, such as for pathology and diagnostic medicine.",Novel approaches to study the intersection of cellular heterogeneity and tissue microanatomy,9873919,R21AI142667,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bar Codes', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Label', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microanatomy', 'Molecular', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Neighborhoods', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'fluorophore', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'imaging approach', 'lymphoid neoplasm', 'lymphoid organ', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'patient stratification', 'protein expression', 'spatial relationship', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,220625,0.016478684099807614
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9991958,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2020,655482,0.07718559224782535
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",10231018,UH3CA246633,"['Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freeze Drying', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'Morphology', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Readiness', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'graphical user interface', 'high dimensionality', 'high resolution imaging', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'ion source', 'machine learning method', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'reagent standardization', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,700000,0.07301005579774268
"VISUALIZATION OF SUBCELLULAR DYNAMICS IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS Abstract Contemporary fluorescence microscopy connects our understanding of molecular events from biochemistry and structural biology with their activities in living cells. Lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM) has made it possible for us to track phenomena such as endocytic vesicle assembly or lipid kinase recruitment across an entire cell with high resolution, in both space and time, and with nearly single-molecule sensitivity. Development during the past year of lattice light sheet microscopy with adaptive optics (AO-LLSM) has overcome the optical limitations that have so far restricted most studies to individual cells in culture, allowing us to achieve comparable resolution and sensitivity in the complex optical environment of an intact, living, multicellular organism. It promises to bridge the gap between cells and organisms, through high sensitivity, volumetric imaging, with diffraction-limited resolution, of living tissues and developing embryos. We propose a research program in three overlapping stages: implementation of AO-LLSM (in collaboration with its developer), development of the new kinds of visualization and analysis software required by the scale and complexity of the datasets, and use of AO-LLSM to solve a problem in vertebrate development. To meet the computational challenges of analyzing the 4D data sets (from low signal-to-noise, the often non- punctate characteristics of the objects being studied, the temporally varying spatial complexity of the data, and the size of the data sets), we will develop new approaches using deep learning and related algorithms, with consultation from experts. As a paradigm application, we will study the consequences of Notch signaling and the related membrane-traffic and protein translocation events for cell differentiation in zebrafish early neurogenesis. AO-LLSM will for the first time allow us to relate molecular signaling events occurring on a timescale of seconds at cell interfaces to the ultimate fate of daughter cells many hours later. We therefore expect that in the course of resolving some long- standing issues in cell fate determination, we will develop microscopy approaches and computer visualization tools that are widely applicable to a range of model systems and biological questions. Narrative We will implement and apply a novel, live-cell imaging strategy (Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy with Adaptive Optics: AO-LLSM) that spans, with diffraction-limited resolution, a range from molecules to tissues and from seconds to hours.

"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,9885175,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Weight', 'clinical imaging', 'elastography', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'liver imaging', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'simulation', 'sound', 'subcutaneous']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,590183,0.032116694680916484
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Pittsburgh Drug Discovery Institute (UPDDI) is requesting funds to purchase the Perkin Elmer OPERA PHENIX high speed, high resolution spinning disk confocal High-Content Screening (HCS) device. The Opera Phenix will replace two Molecular Devices ImageXpress Ultra high content readers purchased in 2008, which are critical to multiple NIH-, DoD-, and Foundation-funded projects at the University of Pittsburgh, but are no longer supported by the manufacturer and have been decommissioned. We have determined that one Opera Phenix instrument can replace the two IXUs. The Phenix is a third generation HCS instrument that will be essential to satisfy the diverse needs of users that the UPDDI serves. No comparable instruments exist at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Carnegie Mellon University. Over the last decade, HCS has become a standard in the pharmaceutical industry for target identification, phenotypic screening, as well as toxicology, and in academia for large-scale biological studies, where cell-by- cell quantitation is critical. The UPDDI has been an academic pioneer in the application of HCS and serves an extensive number of collaborators across campus that require and rely on HCS, ranging from neurodegeneration, organ regeneration, cancer, liver diseases, organotypic model development, and traumatic brain injury. Our diverse user groups’ needs emphasize discovery models of physiological relevance and high complexity, and therefore require fast, high resolution 2D, 3D, and kinetic imaging and maximum flexibility in image analysis. The large number of HCS users working in the UPDDI further demands a fast system to permit effective sharing of instrument time, and an integrated database with off-site user access to perform off- line analysis. Key requirements for an HCS imager therefore are superior speed in acquiring z-series of images at high resolution of thick specimens in aqueous matrices, mature yet flexible image algorithms, and seamless integration of instrument software with system, public,and custom-developed UPDDI databases. The only instrument that meets all of these criteria is the Opera Phenix because it has 1) fast laser-based illumination and the ability to acquire multiple channels simultaneously 2) water immersion objectives that eliminate non-matching refractive indices, which limit spherical aberrations of air and oil objectives at longer working distances and require adjustment of correction collars depending on imaging depth; 3) a powerful suite of user-friendly yet flexible image analysis routines including a 3D module, advanced texture and morphology analysis, and intuitive and user-friendly machine learning; and 4) the ability to perform seamless “adaptive high-resolution imaging”, i.e., pre-scanning a large area at low magnification, followed by automated “on-the- fly” switching to higher magnification to acquire high resolution images of user-defined regions of interest. The Opera Phenix is the only instrument on the market that is capable of fulfilling the demands of the University of Pittsburgh’s diverse drug discovery community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern drug discovery increasingly demands better and more disease relevant models and the ability to analyze them. High-content screening (HCS) has become indispensable in the analysis of such models as it permits the analysis of cells, their constituents, and interactions in their proper biological context. The third generation HCS instrument, Opera Phenix, produces the quality and quantity of data from cells, tissues and experimental animals that are required for computational and systems biological investigations, while at the same time providing the throughput needed for automated screening.",Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery,9935240,S10OD028450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academia', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Drug Industry', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immersion', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical center', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oils', 'Phenotype', 'Reader', 'Refractive Indices', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Water', 'aqueous', 'base', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'organ regeneration', 'physiologic model', 'screening', 'user-friendly']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,S10,2020,1010594,0.022365231858943214
"Imaging Mass Spectrometry for metabolome mapping SUMMARY In response to NOT-GM-20-013, we are requesting a supplement to our R01 5R01GM120033-04 for an MALDI imaging source unit to be attached to an existing Q ExactiveMass Spectrometer (Ultra-High Mass Range Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™) for spatial mapping of metabolites in thin tissue sections. Within our R01 award, to analyze NMR metabolome data we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on recent developments in machine learning. We have coded these algorithms and tested their sensitivity and specificity on both synthesized and real data. We then applied these methods to human disease models and identified putative biomarkers. To validate these biomarkers, we have developed methods to analyze animal tissues and human brain organoids using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), which permits spatial localization of metabolites without labeling. This targeted IMS metabolic phenotyping approach complements our untargeted NMR methods: it allows us to determine whether the individual metabolites identified by NMR represent bona fide biomarkers and to develop metabolic hypotheses for their association with disease. We submit this request for imaging mass spectrometer hardware because a nearby IMS facility on which we have relied has closed and no other IMS facility exists in greater Houston area. Performing the IMS studies ourselves, with the help of collaborators, will accelerate our discovery about the role small molecules and metabolites play in health and disease. This instrument will help us better i) perform metabolome screens to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on neural cell types in human brain organoid models; ii) perform high-throughput drug screening to stimulate neural stem cells to produce new neurons in the brain organoid models to regenerate damaged tissue; and iii) use our NMR algorithms to develop a protocol for quantitative imaging. None of these studies will be possible without the imaging mass spectrometer. Given our access to state-of-the-art equipment, data-collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms that are especially sensitive and specific to NMR spectral data, we are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools and screening methods for metabolites and synthetic small molecules. Using an imaging mass spectrometer to map metabolite distribution may help us discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for a broad spectrum of brain disorders that lead to neurodegeneration. Such broad usage of our platform would be transformative for neuroscientists, neurologists, and their patients. NARRATIVE The metabolome is a dynamic and sensitive biological system that reflects both innate processes and environmental influences, and can therefore tell us much about an organism's health and homeostasis. In our R01, we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms to analyze NMR metabolome data.

"A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The metabolite and neurotransmitter profiles of neural tissues provide a unique window into brain’s physiological state and can be used to extract potential biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows simultaneous mapping and quantification of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters without exogenous contrast agents thus promised tremendous opportunities for molecular imaging of the brain. However, due to several fundamental technical challenges, including low SNR, poor spatial resolution, long imaging time and inaccurate separation of spectrally overlapping molecular signals, most in vivo MRSI studies to date are still limited to very low-resolution experiments (~1cm3 voxel size) with small brain coverages. The primary goal of this proposed research is to develop, optimize and evaluate a new framework to model, acquire and process MRSI data to enable simultaneous, high-resolution, whole- brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will design and implement a novel acquisition strategy that synergistically combines SNR- efficient, multi-slab and multi-TE excitation, sparse sampling in a (k,t,TE)-space and optimized TE selection with maximum echo sampling to generate J-resolved (multi-TE) MRSI data with an unprecedented combination of speed, resolution and organ coverage. In Aim 2, we will develop novel nonlinear low-dimensional models of general MR spectra using a learning-based strategy that integrates the biochemical priors of neural tissues, known physics-based MRSI signal modeling and deep neural networks. These learned models will effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem and allow for significantly improved speed, resolution and SNR tradeoffs as well as signal separation. Novel computational solutions that effectively exploit the learned models and other spatial-spectral-TE constraints will be developed for spatiospectral reconstruction of metabolites and neurotransmitters from the noisy, high-resolution J-resolved MRSI data. Finally, in Aim 3, we will systematically evaluate the proposed technology in terms of speed, resolution, SNR, and quantitative accuracy using computer simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed technology for mapping metabolites and neurotransmitters in both healthy volunteers and temporal lobe epilepsy patients with mesial temporal sclerosis will be demonstrated. The success of the proposed research will lead to significant progress for in vivo MRSI and represent an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases. This tool, when fully developed, will add a transformative dimension to the existing neuroimaging technology profiles, with the potential to impact the diagnosis and management of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a potentially powerful modality that allows simultaneous mapping of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters noninvasively, which provide a unique window into brain’s physiological states and can be used to extract biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. However, the current MRSI techniques do not provide the desired combination of resolution, imaging speed and organ coverage for many basic science and clinical applications. The proposed research will develop a new rapid, J-resolved MRSI technology to enable high-resolution, whole-brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time, which, if successful, will lead to significant progress for the field of MRSI and an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases.",A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping,10057847,R21EB029076,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging problem', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sclerosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'computerized data processing', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'healthy volunteer', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'potential biomarker', 'quantum', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565546,0.007400868325021378
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity.

"In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging ABSTRACT There is still great need in better characterizing new targeted therapies in vivo, especially prior to clinical translation. In this regard, preclinical molecular imaging is a central tool in the targeted drug development pipeline. However, there is still a lack of integrated imaging platforms that can enable longitudinal (multiple time points) and spatially-resolved monitoring of complex fingerprints including molecular, metabolic and functional signatures in the same tumor/subject. This new integrated multiplexing imaging platform will play a crucial role in the development of the next generation of targeted drugs and elucidating (multi-) drug resistance mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated the unique capabilities of optical imaging in quantifying receptor-target engagement in live subjects by leveraging fluorescence lifetime. This outstanding achievement was realized thanks to the combination of instrumental, algorithmic and biochemical innovations to enable, for the first time, whole-body time-resolved optical imaging based on structured light for 2D or 3D Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in live subjects. Herein, we will further impact the field of optical preclinical imaging and drug delivery assessment by 1) integrating a cutting-edge high-resolution, time-resolved SPAD array imager for improved photon collection efficiency, spatial resolution, and portability; 2) we will harness the latest developments in Deep Learning (DL) for ultra-fast, quantitative, but fitting/iterative inverse solver-free image formation, in both 2D and 3D providing image formation/processing solutions to facilitate multiplexed imaging; 3) we will implement new functionalities in our imaging platform to enable the concurrent longitudinal imaging of multiple clinically relevant target-receptor interactions (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals. NARRATIVE Following an ever increased focus on personalized medicine, there is a continuing need to develop preclinical molecular imaging modalities to guide the development and optimization of targeted therapies. This research program will combine novel time-resolved cameras as well as deep learning techniques to broaden the impact of macroscopic lifetime imaging with the overarching goal to facilitate multiplexed imaging for a comprehensive assessment of cellular delivery efficacy of multiple clinically relevant drugs (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as drug response via metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals.",In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging,9997447,R01CA250636,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Electronics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging ligands', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'functional status', 'imager', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'technological innovation', 'tomography', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly']",NCI,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,637634,0.010558771061304277
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,9894766,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'progenitor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'stem cells', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,491199,0.009758777559097199
"Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo 1 Dermatologists rely on visual (clinical widefield) and dermoscopic examination of skin lesions to guide the need  2 for biopsy. With this approach, sensitivity is high, but specificity tends to be quite variable and lower, resulting  3 in millions of biopsies of benign lesions every year. To improve specificity, several optical technologies are  4 being developed to noninvasively detect skin cancer. Of these, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is the  5 furthest advanced in clinical utility, proven for diagnosing skin cancers with high sensitivity and specificity.  6 RCM imaging, guided by dermoscopy, detects skin cancers with 2 times superior specificity, and reduces the  7 benign-to-malignant biopsy rate by 2 times, compared to that with dermoscopy alone. In 2016, the Centers for  8 Medicare and Medicaid Services granted current procedural terminology (CPT) reimbursement codes for RCM  9 imaging of skin. RCM imaging combined with dermoscopy is now advancing into clinical practice, sparing pa- 10 tients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. However, toward widespread acceptance and adoption, a 11 key challenge is that clinical widefield examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as 12 three separate procedures with separate devices. Clinicians do not precisely know the location of RCM imag- 13 es relative to the surrounding contextual lesion morphology that is seen with clinical widefield examination and 14 dermoscopy, resulting in lower and more variable diagnostic accuracy (particularly, sensitivity, positive and 15 negative predictive values). We propose a novel solution: (i) a new objective lens with an integrated micro- 16 camera, to deliver a concurrent widefield image of the skin surface surrounding the location of RCM imaging; 17 (ii) a new software algorithm for widefield image-based tracking of the location of RCM images within a dermoscopic 18 field of view; (iii) a new diagnostic approach that will proactively use widefield imaging to locate RCM images in 19 dermoscopic images. We intend to deliver this integrated widefield clinical, dermoscopic and RCM imaging ap- 20 proach into the clinic, toward a new standard for more accurate, consistent and faster RCM imaging to guide 21 patient care. Preliminary studies with a “mock” objective lens and micro-camera on a bench-top set-up 22 demonstrated excellent optical sectioning (~2 µm) and resolution (~1 µm) for RCM imaging, and accurate and 23 repeatable location of RCM fields-of-view within the widefield image. RCM images showed excellent cellular 24 and morphologic detail in vivo. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a handheld reflectance confocal micro- 25 scope with integrated widefield camera; (2) to develop image processing algorithms for real-time widefield im- 26 aging-guided tracking of RCM image locations within dermoscopic fields; (3) to test and validate performance 27 on 100 patients. Although our proposition is for skin lesions, the research will surely have wider impact for 28 imaging in other settings, particularly, with miniaturized confocal microscopes and endoscopes, which have 29 very small fields-of-view. We are a highly synergistic team from Montana State University, Memorial Sloan 30 Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.). RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Clinical examination and dermoscopy combined with reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging is a newly emerging optical imaging procedure that can noninvasively guide diagnosis of skin cancers, and reduce the need for biopsy. However, clinical examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as three separate procedures with separate devices, limiting effectiveness and impact. We propose a device to combine the three into a single procedure, which will help dermatologists and patients by making the skin examinations quicker, more accurate and more consistent, expanding the impact of this proven approach.",Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo,9860776,R01EB028752,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Current Procedural Terminology', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermis', 'Dermoscopy', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Engineering', 'Epidermis', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lesion', 'Lesion by Morphology', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicaid services', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Montana', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lens', 'medical specialties', 'microscopic imaging', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'optical imaging', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'routine practice', 'skin lesion', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY - BOZEMAN,R01,2020,649717,0.012553981960560215
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,10004647,UH3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Endothelium', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication safety', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UH3,2020,1000,0.0486837708765289
"Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) Summary. Our long-term goal is to develop a powerful tool based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for non- invasive human skin imaging in order to improve clinical diagnosis, guide effective treatment and advance clinical and cosmetic/pharmaceutical research by providing access to dynamic cellular and molecular processes during therapy. MPM is a nonlinear optical imaging technique that provides unique structural and molecular contrast based on endogenous signals such as second harmonic generation from collagen and two- photon excited fluorescence from NADH/FAD+, keratin, melanin and elastin fibers. This contrast allows MPM to provide multi-color, rich molecular information content images that can enhance diagnostic accuracy. MPM overcomes fundamental limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging and extends the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. Validation of the clinical potential of this technology has been facilitated over the past 10 years by a device developed by Jenlab in Germany, currently the only clinical MPM system on the market. This device has technical limitations in terms of field-of-view (FOV), imaging speed, complexity and cost, which are major barriers to clinical adoption. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a MPM system that is highly optimized for rapid, label-free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. The Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) imaging platform will incorporate the innovative optical engine of a benchtop prototype developed at BLI. InfraDerm will innovate on this design to transform it into a compact, portable device, suitable for human skin imaging in clinical setting. Key innovations include: 1) a compact engineering design based on integrating a compact fs fiber laser into the imaging head along with a customized folded optical design to reduce complexity and cost and enhance portability; 2) hardware and software strategies that include a customized patient interface and a combination of optical and mechanical scanning mechanisms with deep learning image restoration to allow millimeter-to-centimeter scale imaging within minutes while maintaining sub-micron resolution. This approach will expand the in vivo imaging area from mm to cm scale, which will be scanned within minutes with sub- cellular resolution. In Aim 1 we will develop the FLAME prototype that incorporates these features. In Aim 2 we will test its technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging by evaluating potential effects of motion artifacts. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the FLAME system potential for non-invasive assessment of melanin content, an ability with potential impact in differential diagnosis and early assessment of treatment efficacy of pigmentary skin disorders, such as melasma. Phase II will refine the technological approach and will test the device feasibility in a first clinical application, differential diagnosis of patients with melasma, a long time dermatology challenge and a particular interest for pharma companies developing therapies for this skin condition. Narrative  InfraDerm LLC proposes to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a laser scanning microscope based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) that addresses fundamental and technical limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging, extending the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. The proposed Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) prototype will be highly optimized for rapid, label- free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution.

"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),10152786,R01ES032730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Breast Cancer Epidemiology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gland', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary gland', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mesenchymal', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'North Carolina', 'Odds Ratio', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinogenicity', 'cell motility', 'chemical stability', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging capabilities', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'mammary epithelium', 'mammary gland development', 'man', 'model design', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,559511,0.026144063118809055
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of different types of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an extensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spatial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical.

Whereas single- particle cryo-EM today is capable of directly solving atomic structures of biomolecular assemblies in isolation, electron tomography (ET) in unstained frozen-hydrated samples is widely used to capture the 3D organization of supramolecular complexes in their native (organelle, cell, or tissue) environments. We have identified three inter-related research areas where our computational modeling experience (historically rooted in pre-revolution multi-scale approaches) offers the biggest value to today's post-revolution EM community: (1) medium resolution cryo-EM modeling, (2) the segmentation and denoising of cryo-ET data, and (3) the validation of atomic models and their corresponding maps. The first aim is an extension of promising new ideas in flexible fitting as well as secondary structure prediction for medium resolution maps, which have been our key research areas in the past. medium resolution (5-10Å) maps are still widely used in EM and can be of significant biological importance. This is particularly true in the case of cryo-ET maps, which are harder to read than single particle cryo-EM maps because they often exhibit considerable noise, anisotropic resolution, and anisotropic density variations due to the low dose requirements and the missing wedge in the Fourier space. In the case of tightly packed or crowded macromolecular structures, the fusion of nearby biomolecular densities prevents an automated segmentation of geometric shapes, requiring a labor-intensive manual tracing by human experts. We are currently developing novel computational approaches to provide a more objective strategy for missing wedge correction in homogeneous specimen areas of tomograms. Our hybrid approach combines deconvolution and denoising with template matching in a unified mathematical framework that allows modeling constraints to be imposed in a least-squares optimization process. Our approach can also be extended to the flexible refinement of atomic structures using our damped dynamics flexible fitting approach by tuning the internal point-spread functions to the missing wedge of the ET data. To support these aims, we will quantitatively measure the fitness of an atomic model in local density regions and characterize the fitness of maps with reliable reference structures. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include the refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, bacterial chemoreceptor arrays, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established Internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages and as plugins for the popular UCSF Chimera graphics program. Project Narrative This project will help biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels, from the atomic to the living organism. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,10120245,R01GM062968,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemoreceptors', 'Chimera organism', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Cryo-electron tomography', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydration status', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Motors', 'Molecular Structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'beta pleated sheet', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'density', 'electron tomography', 'experience', 'feature detection', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'fundamental research', 'heuristics', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'macromolecular assembly', 'novel', 'particle', 'prevent', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'structured data', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,313572,0.03590979720738343
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary We request a high-flux x-ray source and to acquire new team expertise in segmentation from microCT images, in order to apply a new 3D form of histology developed through our parent R24 to begin to characterize the cellular and tissue geometries of COVID-19-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) pneumonia, our pandemic’s most common cause of death. Our novel imaging tool, X-ray histotomography, is based on microCT of fixed and metal-stained tissue. It is unique among 3D imaging methods as the only nondestructive way to achieve pan-cellular imaging (allowing characterization of all cell types and tissues) and is potentially practical. Histotomography uniquely allows direct comparison with today’s 2D standard of tissue diagnosis, histology, capable of producing both 3D renderings and undistorted 2D slices at any angle and any slice thickness. Unlike histology, we will also allow us to precisely characterize cellular arrangements into tissues after fixing and staining of samples with metal. The ability to volumetrically characterize cell types and their arrangements in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is particularly important because it is what kills most patients in coronavirus-based pandemics, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2003, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2012, COVID-19 now. The proposed work will increase our preparedness for future pandemics. ARDS lungs are an ideal human tissue model for mathematically defining human disease because all cell types are affected. The proposed work with COVID-19 lungs will increase the precision with which we understand the different stages of coronavirus lung infection and serve as a model for characterizing the Geometry of Disease across all organ systems. Histotomography in the parent R24 is currently limited to animal models, focusing on the zebrafish. The supplement will allow us to translate our work to human health, which was originally envisioned by the PI, as part of defining the “Geometry of Disease”. Our experience with this technology tells us that we will be able to characterize the numbers of each of the basic inflammatory cell types, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages (which are morphologically distinct) in terms of numbers, volumes, shapes, and density in the inflamed tissue, and to also characterize the changes in the lung epithelia (bronchial ciliated epithelial cells and pneumocytes, cell death, and the filling of airways with fluid and fibrinous exudate, and vascular inflammation. In addition to quantitation of tissue changes, we will also be able to visualize pathological change in the tissues using virtual reality. Histotomography will serve as a way to validate a humanized mouse model of COVID-19 infection by comparing the quantitative changes with those in human autopsy samples. We will be comparing both standard histological sections and histotomographic images from adjacent tissue. Machine learning will ultimately allow us to automate recognition of cell types and pathological change. The proposed augmentation of our instrumentation and expertise will facilitate definitions of the “Geometry of Disease” across organ systems. Project narrative We request an equipment upgrade and acquisition of expertise to accelerate progress and to pilot the translational use of our ORIP-funded technology to provide the first 3D understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Histotomography, a new 3D form of histology based on microCT, is the first practical way to turn the current standard of 2D, qualitative, tissue analytics into quantitative, morphometrics that is inclusive of all cell types and tissue architecture. Organismal and tissue phenotyping at both scales makes possible the first 3D, complete phenotyping of cells and tissue architecture, promising to transform human tissue diagnostics, preclinical toxicology, and more comprehensive high-throughput genetic, chemical and disease phenomics.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),10169023,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Alveolar', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biology', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Volumes', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Control Animal', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Female', 'Floods', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung infections', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Metals', 'Microscopy', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Negative Staining', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumonia', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readiness', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Synchrotrons', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'body system', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'computational basis', 'density', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'human morbidity', 'human mortality', 'human tissue', 'humanized mouse', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'macrophage', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'microCT', 'mouse model', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'parent project', 'phenomics', 'pneumocyte', 'pre-clinical', 'reconstruction', 'submicron', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'vascular inflammation', 'virtual reality']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2020,655483,0.004733731226744605
"Multimodal mass spectrometry imaging of mouse and human liver We propose to develop a multimodal mass spectrometry imaging pipeline with novel desorption sources and data integration that will enable simultaneously mapping of biomolecule abundance in 3-dimensions in biological tissues at high spatial resolution (micron to submicron) and high speed (>10 ms/pixel) in a near-native environment. This would provide previously inaccessible information on cellular and tissue organization, and how homeostasis and disease intersect at the level of tissue physiology. A major challenge for performing multi- omics using mass spectrometry imaging has been the (i) lack of universal ionization methods, (ii) limited sample preparation protocols for preserving chemical gradients, (iii) low sensitivity, and (iv) limited tools for integration of large quantities of data. Our laboratories are developing systematic MS imaging for high sensitivity and high resolution analysis of diverse tissues. We discovered that water-based gas cluster ion beams (H2O-GCIB) operating at high energy yield ionization enhancements of multiple biomolecules (e.g., metabolites, lipids, and peptides/protein fragments) with high sensitivity at 1 µm lateral resolution and without labeling or complicated sample preparation. Coupled with unique Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) instrumentation and cryogenic sample handling, we have imaged biomolecules directly in cells and tissues in a near-native state (i.e., frozen-hydration) with feature resolution of 1-10 µm. Low concentration biomolecules (e.g. cardiolipin and metabolites) that were impossible to localize in single cells previously are now visible with 3-dimensional localization. Moreover, the sufficient signal per pixel, we can use automated data analysis to characterize biologically active functional sites within 1 µm2 and areas of interest in single cells. We further developed data integration methods to combine imaging data from adjacent sections to create a multi-model imaging data sets. We propose to develop a pipeline for MS imaging analysis of biomolecules, and to elucidate molecular heterogeneity in tissues using multimodal imaging. To support the multi-modal analysis pipeline, we will develop an integrated data analysis platform. Integration of multiomics remains challenging, particularly spatially localize multiple biomolecules at single cell level. The direct visualization of cellular contents provides information on biomolecular composition, interactions and functions. This network of biomolecules is the driving force of specific behavior of cells in physiological states. Despite this, a comprehensive grasp of these interactions at cellular level has not moved beyond segregated methods. Our efforts will result in an integrated multimodal imaging platform to summon the best characteristics of each image form, acquiring a complete picture the biomolecular network at spatial resolution of 1 µm. With this direct visualization, we will address how metabolism links with functional biomarkers that stem from metabolism-associated protein complexes and phase-separated membrane-less organelles at the subcellular level, and how this drive different cell death modalities, including different modes of cell death. We propose to develop a new mass spectrometry imaging pipeline that will enable mapping of biomolecules in in biological tissues at high spatial resolution.

"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders.

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,9856137,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,74758,0.013806905443031385
"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target.

"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. The proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways that biological specimens are examined by allowing 3-D structural and functional imaging of suspending cells at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or 2-D imaging.",3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry,10023268,R21GM135848,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Hematological Disease', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Leukocytes', 'Lifting', 'Lighting', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Records', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'digital', 'feature extraction', 'fluorescence imaging', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'lens', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'software development', 'targeted imaging', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tomography']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2020,155784,0.04232767733828739
"Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness ABSTRACT  It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape.  One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.  This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level, where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and fetal medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The robust establishment of correct shape is essential for proper tissue function. Tissue shape change is a mechanical process that necessitates the coordinated force generation and motion of thousands of cells. Identifying how physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape will shed light onto many congenital disorders that result from morphogenetic dysregulation.",Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness,9950519,K99GM136915,"['Actomyosin', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Size', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Disorders', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Galaxy', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mechanics', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transportation', 'Work', 'cohesion', 'computer science', 'confocal imaging', 'congenital heart disorder', 'fetal', 'fetal medicine', 'fly', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'malformation', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'theories', 'tissue-level behavior', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2020,98836,0.018500656299740126
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9850978,R01EB016695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,569563,0.032334485341037215
"A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain Project Summary  In this project, we propose to validate and characterize ﬁber orientation estimation from diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI) through the optimization of a multi-modality, multi-scale imaging pipeline for whole mouse brains. DTI is a powerful tool used to noninvasively report 3D microstructural properties of nervous tissue on a macroscopic scale, and has played an important role in the understanding and diagnosis of a number of neurological disease processes. Modern acquisitions of DTI data can be processed to generate a 3D diffusion proﬁle known as an orientation diffusion function (ODF) at each voxel. The ODF is used to infer the orientation of local axon ﬁber pop- ulations. Previous efforts to validate these orientation estimates have primarily relied on serial optical histology as a ground truth dataset. Histology-based pipelines involve the labor intensive task of physically sectioning the tissue into thin slices, leading to physical destruction of the sample and anisotropic resolution. These limitations potentially confound the accuracy of 3D orientation estimation, complicate the process of spatially registering the ground-truth and DTI datasets, and limit quantitative comparisons to select regions of interest (ROI) across the brain sample.  In recent years, synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for high-resolution tissue imaging. With a mosaic projection-stitching method, a whole mouse brain can be imaged at an isotropic, 3D resolution of 1.2 microns after prior imaging with DTI. To enhance microCT contrast, the tis- sue specimens are ﬁxed and stained with the same kind of metal-based stains used in electron microscopy (EM) prior to embedding in resin. We will optimize this microCT-EM validation pipeline to address the limitations of pre- vious histology-based studies, and characterize DTI algorithm performance across a whole mouse brain using micron- to nano-scale neurological information.  The speciﬁc aims of the proposal are: (1) model phase contrast to optimize microCT data acquisition, (2) vali- date DTI ODF reconstruction methods using ground-truth microCT (3) characterize DTI performance using under- lying tissue microstructure information from EM. Upon completion, aim 1 will generate a novel theoretical model and acquisition strategy to exploit microCT phase contrast in strongly absorbing biological samples. Aim 2 will generate a ground-truth dataset of ODFs across a whole mouse brain, which will be used to calculate algorithm- speciﬁc spatial maps of DTI performance. In Aim 3, around 20 ROI will be selected for nano-scale imaging with EM, and DTI performance will be characterized by quantitative features of the underlying neural architecture. These results will provide an unprecedented microstructure-driven understanding of the DTI signal, allowing fu- ture studies to develop more advanced DTI models and acquisition strategies to better leverage ﬁber orientation and connectivity information in the treatment of neurological disease. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to use synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography and serial electron microscopy to validate diffusion MRI reconstruction methods. This unprecedented pipeline allows for imaging the same tissue across scales ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers. The high resolution modalities will provide insight into the true neurological microstructure driving the diffusion MRI signal, leading to better modeling and increased clinical and research utility.","A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain",9987313,F31NS113571,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plant Resins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'electron tomography', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'interest', 'microCT', 'multimodality', 'nanometer', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'tractography', 'validation studies']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,40827,0.04060999146732299
"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,9847792,R01DE027677,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'microCT', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2020,523782,-0.0077786674918657525
"Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY Marfan Syndrome (MFS), one of the most common heritable connective tissue disorders, affects 1 in 5,000 individuals and has destructive manifestations in multiple organ systems; notably the cardiovascular system. MFS is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a genetic mutation in the Fibrillin-1 gene leading to aberrant TGFβ signaling, and frequently results in aortic aneurysm, dissection, and death. Interestingly, the associated degeneration within the aortic vessel wall almost always occurs in the aortic root or ascending aorta and not in the descending or abdominal aorta; while this putatively reflects regional differences in hemodynamic stress, antihypertensive treatment alone is not effective in managing aortic aneurysm in MFS. Alternatively, it is also the case that aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), which predominate the vasoactive medial layer of the vessel wall, have heterogeneous subtypes stemming from distinct developmental germ-layers based on their anatomical location; Neuroectoderm (NE) origin gives rise to ascending ASMCs and Paraxial mesoderm (PM) origin gives rise to descending ASMCs. This project will use origin-specific ASMCs differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MFS and healthy controls to test a novel hypothesis that developmental origin causes location-specific abnormalities in ASMCs associated with medial degeneration in MFS. Additionally, it will explore for biomarkers of presymptomatic congenital defects in Marfan Syndrome to identify novel targets for prophylactic therapeutic intervention. These studies will characterize phenotypic differences in human ASMC subtypes at the cellular and tissue level with stem-cell culturing and vascular tissue engineering techniques. Using state-of-the-art core facilities we will also conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on these cellular and tissue models to cultivate a rich biological profile for bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, we will develop a bioinformatics pipeline to elucidate novel prophylactic targets inherently responsible for ascending aortic MFS-induced medial degeneration, using our uniquely combined phenotypic, transcriptomic, and proteomic results as input. Lastly, based on our bioinformatic outputs we will test our intervention on our human iPSC-based in vitro models and compare to treatment with Losartan, a commonly used anti-hypertensive drug that also exhibits unique anti-remodeling properties and has shown promise for managing the symptoms of MFS in animals and in patients. The training plan for this fellowship will focus on technical skills, experimental design and critical analysis, critique of published scientific data, and presentation skills. It will be achieved by regular mentor meetings, journal clubs, conference presentations, bi- annual committee meetings, and advanced coursework. The majority of training will occur in the Costa Lab at the Cardiovascular Research Center at ISMMS, a highly active and collaborative environment with available mentors and students aligned with my research topics and career goals. Additional training will occur in the Ramirez Lab with senior researchers in Marfan Syndrome and biochemical investigation techniques. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposes a bioengineering approach for investigating new human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based cellular and 3D tissue models of Marfan Syndrome (MFS), a rare connective tissue disorder that frequently causes aortic aneurysm and dissection specifically in the ascending aorta. Our findings will elucidate mechanobiological differences in aortic smooth muscle cells of distinct embryologic origin, and their underlying mechanisms of response to mechanical stimuli. This will help improve our understanding of aneurysm localization in MFS, and guide more effective therapies for MFS patients in the future.",Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome,10054654,F31HL149271,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Actins', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Core Facility', 'Critiques', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descending aorta', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'Fellowship', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Germ', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Losartan', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Neural Crest', 'Neuroectoderm', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paraxial Mesoderm', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scanning Probe Microscopes', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Students', 'Sudden Death', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Vascular remodeling', 'abdominal aorta', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'career', 'cell dimension', 'collaborative environment', 'confocal imaging', 'drug candidate', 'effective therapy', 'healthy volunteer', 'hemodynamics', 'heritable connective tissue disorder', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'lead candidate', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanotransduction', 'meetings', 'multidimensional data', 'nanoindentation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prophylactic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'regional difference', 'response', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'stem', 'stem cells', 'symposium', 'symptom management', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'two-dimensional', 'vascular tissue engineering']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2020,43920,-0.00604969037578708
